Good morning and welcome to the Boston Scientific Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Lauren Tengler
Thank you, Andrew. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our (Technical Difficulty) results which included reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings. The duration of this call will be approximately one hour. Mike will focus his comments on Q2 performance, largely compare it to 2019 (Technical Difficulty) impact from COVID as well as future catalysts and the outlook for our business including Q3 and full year '21 guidance. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, provide more details regarding our Q3 and full-year '21 guidance and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone on the call of that operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures, for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisition for organic growth versus 2020 and 2019 is (inaudible) which closed March 1st, 2021 and Vertiflex and BTG interventional medicines, which closed in May and mid-August of 2019 respectively. Divestitures include BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which closed on March 1st, 2021 and the global embolic microspheres portfolio (Technical Difficulty) franchise, which were divested in mid-August 2019 and second quarter 2020 respectively. Guidance excludes the recently announced Lumenis surgical acquisition, which is expected to close in second half of 2021 and Farapulse acquisition, which is expected to close in Q3 2021 which are subject to customary closing conditions including antitrust clearances. For more information, please refer to Slide 9 of our financial operating highlights, which may be found on our Investor Relations website.

On this call all references to sales and revenue unless otherwise specified are organic. Finally growth goals of 6% to 8% ex-COVID represent comparisons between time periods in which results are not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, aims, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic upon the company's operations and financial results, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.

At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?

Thanks Lauren. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. I am pleased to report very strong Q2 financial results as a resumption of (inaudible) procedures strengthened in the U.S. (Technical Difficulty) in many, but not all of our regions across the globe. We're well positioned for the second half of '21 and beyond as we continue to execute our category leadership strategy, driven by our innovative pipeline, expansion in the faster growth markets, globalization efforts and enhanced digital capabilities.

Total company second quarter operational sales grew 50% versus 2020. Our net sales grew 52% versus 2020 and (inaudible) versus '19, exceeding our expectations as recovery from the pandemic occurred more quickly than expected, particularly in the U.S. Apparently 6 of the 7 business units grew double-digits organically versus 2019. We estimate that five of our business units grew faster than the respective (Technical Difficulty) ongoing to new product launches and we are now enrolling our human trials at pre-COVID (Technical Difficulty). Q2 adjusted EPS of $0.40 grew 378% versus 2020 (Technical Difficulty) the guidance by $0.02 primarily due to sell [ph] out-performance and lower spend. Adjusted operating margin of 25.1% is slightly ahead of our expectations as we continue to balance investment with our sales recovery.

Give the second quarter outperformance, we are increasing and narrowing our guidance ranges for both sales and EPS, which (inaudible) manageable level of COVID impact in the second half of the year. Compared to 2020 we're targeting in third quarter '21 organic revenue growth of 12% to 14% and (inaudible) 20%. And compared to '19 we're targeting in the third quarter of '21 organic revenue growth of 5% to 7%. And for the full year growth of 6%. Third quarter '21 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.39 to $0.41 and we are updating our full year adjusted EPS to a revised range of $1.58 to $1.62. Dan will provide more details on both sales and EPS performance, including the revenue contribution (Technical Difficulty) continue to expect a third quarter close for Farapulse and a second half '21 close (Technical Difficulty).

I will now provide additional highlights of the second quarter '21 results along with comments at third quarter and '21 outlook.

Operationally EMEA delivered an excellent second quarter with broad-based growth across nearly all the major markets and franchises even as some countries experienced COVID-related lockdowns and procedural delays.

The EMEA region also had double-digit growth in PI, EP, Endo and Neuromod by products such as ACURATE neo2, TheraSphere, POLARx (inaudible) strength in Middle East and Africa. In Asia-Pac although second quarter results included approximately 600 basis points of negative impact of the China tender pricing versus 2019.

We continue to be pleased with our strong growth in Complex PCI and imaging, (Technical Difficulty) by our both innovative portfolio and by the tender win. We continued to expect full-year 2021 double-digit growth China versus both '19 and '20.

I'll provide some comments on the business units. Starting with (Technical Difficulty) sales were very strong growing (Technical Difficulty) 16% versus 19%. (Technical Difficulty) which is the largest franchise grew double-digits as (Technical Difficulty) to expand our category leading portfolio with differentiated laser technology.

Continue to make progress on (Technical Difficulty) second quarter as well as the resumption of (Technical Difficulty) with the management, sales were down 6% organically versus '19. We believe that (inaudible) performance was slightly below the overall market, inclusive of a temporary impact of recent EMBLEM S-ICD physician advisories. Importantly we recently began launching our (inaudible) S-ICD electrode, anticipate improved performance in overall CRM in the second half. So we expect S-ICD revenues to rebound.

Expansion of our commercial infrastructure in partnership with (inaudible). In interventional cardiology, organic sales grew 10% versus 2019. Double digit growth in structural heart valves WATCHMAN and Complex PCI (Technical Difficulty) franchise accelerated sequentially. Sequential growth was driven by, primarily by increasing hospital and physician utilization rates in the U.S., some share gains in Europe. Nearly all U.S. accounts have fully transitioned from WATCHMAN 2.5, they are now using the FLX exclusively. Additionally we're pleased with the 2 year result of (Technical Difficulty) which features a late-breaker at TVT which (Technical Difficulty) positive one-year primary outcomes and then a secondary effectiveness endpoint.

Daniel J. Brennan{BIO 15138161 <GO>}
Thanks, Mike. Second quarter consolidated revenue of $3.77 billion represents 53.6% reported revenue growth versus the second quarter of 2020 (inaudible) tailwind foreign exchange. On an operational basis revenue growth was 49.6% in the quarter. Sales form the Preventice acquisition contributed 240 basis points further offset by the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals resulting in (inaudible) revenue growth above our guidance range (Technical Difficulty) growth versus 2020. Compared to the second quarter 2019 organic growth was 8% to 9% above our guidance range of 3% to 6%. This 8% to 9% growth excludes $15 million in 2019 sale of (Technical Difficulty) in 2021 sale of (Technical Difficulty) which consists of 2 months of (Technical Difficulty) and a full quarter of BTG Interventional Medicine and Preventice.

Top line results drove Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $0.40, representing 378% growth versus 2020, 3% growth versus 2019 and exceeding our guidance range of (Technical Difficulty). Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 17.5% slightly above our expectations driven by sales outperformance in higher margin business. (Technical Difficulty) we have materially worked through the COVID driven negative manufacturing (inaudible) balance sheet in 2020 and as a result expect slight improvement in second half gross margin compared to the first half, we're still not at full year 2019 level and other headwinds remain, in particular the lingering cost of running plants with COVID-specific measures as well as some impact from (Technical Difficulty) items like increased freight costs, selected wage pressure, and price increase on direct (Technical Difficulty).

Second quarter adjusted operating margin is 25.1%, slightly above our expectations, driven by sales outperformance, and balanced investment, also includes a reserve (Technical Difficulty) that we expect will improve access to traditional markets for some of our cardiovascular (Technical Difficulty). GAAP charges within the quarter (Technical Difficulty) in litigation-related expenses, which will account for incremental costs to resolve newly (Technical Difficulty) claims as well as (Technical Difficulty) and corresponding legal fees within our legal reserve. Clearly, (Technical Difficulty) claims remains (Technical Difficulty) settlement, our reserves assumption based on full global resolution now in 2023 given recent claim activity (Technical Difficulty). Our total legal reserve of $617 million (Technical Difficulty) versus March 31st driven by the massive reserve increase in cardiovascular settlement, partially offset by payments to close substantially all of state attorney general mass settlement as well as continuing financial product liability payment.

Moving to below the line, adjusted interest and other expense totaled $107 million in line with expectations. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 11.1% on an adjusted basis, also in line with expectations. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of $838 million and free cash flow was $541 million. $643 million from operating activity versus $102 million net capital expenditures. All remains to deliver adjusted free cash flow in lines of 2020 approximately $2 billion. (Technical Difficulty) accounts receivable during the remainder of the year.

As of June 30th, 2021 we had cash on hand of $2.7 billion. Top priorities of capital deployment (inaudible) M&A, we continue to expect to close the acquisition of surgical [ph] second half of the year and Farapulse in Q3. We have capacity to pursue additional business development opportunities, continuing to remain active with our venture capital and consider opportunistic share repurchases. Ended the Q2 with (inaudible) fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding.

I'll now walk through guidance for Q3 and full year 2021. For full year we expect 2021 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 18.5% to 19.5% versus 2020, which includes an approximate net 50 basis point headwind divestiture of our intrauterine health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceutical partially offset by the acquisition of Preventice. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions and divestitures, we expect (Technical Difficulty) 20% versus 2020 and 6% to 7% versus 2019. And organic comparison to 2019, full year 2019 sales (Technical Difficulty) franchise as well as $81 million in Specialty Pharmaceutical sale and at the midpoint of guidance 2021 sales excluded approximately (Technical Difficulty) sales from recent acquisition (Technical Difficulty) Specialty Pharmaceutical sales prior to (Technical Difficulty).

Q3 2021 we expect operational revenue growth to be in the range of 7% to 13% versus 2020 which includes an approximate 100 basis point headwind (Technical Difficulty) Specialty Pharmaceutical partially offset by the acquisition of Preventice. Excluding the impact of (Technical Difficulty) divestitures, we expect (Technical Difficulty) revenue growth to be in the range of 12% to 14% versus 2020 and 5% to 7% of growth versus 2019, including 300 basis points sequential (Technical Difficulty) headwind Q2 to Q3 2019. Therefore the midpoint of guidance assumes (Technical Difficulty) in line with Q2, the continued manageable level of (Technical Difficulty).

For the Q3 organic comparison to 2019, 2019 sales exclude $35 million in sales of our embolic bead portfolio, intrauterine health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceutical. And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $110 million in sales from the acquisitions of BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August and Preventice. For adjusted operating margin, we continue to target an average of 26% in the back half of 2021, while simultaneously investing to normalize operating expense level in the first half of 2021 (Technical Difficulty) we would expect our near-term run rate. We continue to forecast our full-year 2021 operational tax rate to be approximately 11% and our all-in tax rate to be approximately 10%. We continue to expect adjusted below the line expenses, which include interest payments (Technical Difficulty) costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $400 million to $425 million a year. We expect fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,137 million shares for Q3, 2021 and 1,435 million shares in the full year of 2021.

We are raising full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $1.58 to $1.62, which includes our updated sales guidance and compares Q2 result, which remove the additional uncertainty for our previously wider range. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.39 to $0.41. Please check with our Investor Relations website for Q2, '21 financial and operational highlights which outlines more detailed Q2 result.

With that, I'll turn it back to our newly appointed Vice President of Investor Relations. Congratulations Ms. Lauren, very well deserved. (inaudible)

Lauren Tengler
Thank you, Dan. Andrew, let's open it up for questions for the next 35 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Andrew, please go ahead.

Questions And Answers
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Q - Robert Hopkins{BIO 2150525 <GO>}
Great. And good morning. Can you hear me okay?

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
Yeah. Good morning, Bob.

A - Daniel J. Brennan{BIO 15138161 <GO>}
Very fine, Bob. Good morning.

Q - Robert Hopkins{BIO 2150525 <GO>}
Congrats on the strong quarter. And congrats Lauren. So first question for Mike and Dan is, just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your back half 2021 assumptions. You mentioned that you assume a manageable level of COVID. I'm wondering if you could help us understand what that means. Does that mean, specifically that you assume things get a little worse from what you're seeing today, or do you assume things stay about the same?

A - Daniel J. Brennan{BIO 15138161 <GO>}
I think if you look at the numbers, Bob, and I think a lot of it has to do with the comps, right. If you look at our comps from 2019 quarter-by-quarter, they're 6,6,9,7. And so we put up effectively a 9 in Q2 versus a 6 in 2019. If you look at our guidance for Q3, it's 5% to 7%. So to take the midpoint at 6%, that's against the comp of a 6, which of a 9, which is 300 basis points harder. So in theory, the 6 effectively becomes a 9 when you adjust for comps, which is kind of what we did in Q2. And I won't go through the whole process, but the implied Q4 ends up in a similar range. So I think what you're hearing, I'd say is that, Q2 the impact of COVID was manageable. You heard Mike's comments that the recovery was very strong, particularly in the U.S. And what our guidance would imply is that for the most part continues in the back half. So manageable COVID impact would be a quarter similar to what you saw in Q2.

Q - Robert Hopkins{BIO 2150525 <GO>}
Okay. So sounds like you think -- sorry, go ahead, Mike.

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
No, does that track and make sense for it.

Q - Robert Hopkins{BIO 2150525 <GO>}
Yeah, it sounds like you're assuming that things have basically stayed the same, they don't get worse from what you just said, which...

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
Correct. That's correct.

Q - Robert Hopkins{BIO 2150525 <GO>}
Okay, great. And then just a quick, quick follow-up on the question is, I was wondering if you could talk just a little bit more about WATCHMAN trends in the quarter. It sounds like things went really well, but just curious if you maybe could provide a growth rate over 2019. Just curious for kind of flushing out the experience with WATCHMAN in the quarter a little bit more and if you can quantify it at all, that would be helpful. Thank you.

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
Yeah, sure. Yeah, we won't be providing a growth rate on '19, but overall the plans with WATCHMAN FLX has gone exceedingly well. As we mentioned, the U.S. has really been fully converted at this point, which happened ahead of schedule and we enrolled the OPTION trial ahead of schedule. But the big benefit we're seeing is with the ease of use and the safety profile of FLX, the utilization of WATCHMAN FLX in the U.S. accounts in particular continues to increase. So we do have some small new incremental account openings, but far in a way the bulk of the growth in U.S. is being driven by increasing physician utilization and penetration rates. And we recently have some approval in Japan. And so, you're starting to get some minor impact from Japan, which we'll get more so in the second half and as well as in 2022.

But it's really being driven by the utilization rates, safety profile, physician comfort with the device and training new physicians at existing facilities. So current doctors are doing more WATCHMAN and new doctors at the same facilities are being trained on WATCHMAN. And the referral base to physician community is becoming more and more comfortable and aware as are patients with this treatment. So we've pegged this growth of this segment to be likely plus 30% growth. And we continue to expect to do well in it. But it's exciting platform for us.

Q - Robert Hopkins{BIO 2150525 <GO>}
Great. Thank you.

Operator
The next question comes from Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Robert Marcus{BIO 18720787 <GO>}
Great. I'll add my congratulations on a really nice quarter. Two from me. First, it looks like you had great growth in the U.S. with 12% organic over 2019. I was wondering maybe you could just give us an overview of where you're seeing the recovery. Are you seeing any lagging trends from Delta variant and is there any discrepancy in inpatient versus outpatient. You're one of the first to report here with such a global covering and diverse offering, I think it would be really instructful as we think about the rest of the year in the guidance.

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
Yeah, so just broadly, we saw terrific results in the U.S., very strong results in Europe despite the lockdowns in Europe and I should say more COVID impact in Europe. That business grew 9% organic. And we had the most significant COVID impacts in Asia and ASEAN countries and Japan in particular with Korea, Australia, doing well as with China. So we saw more COVID impact broadly in Asia-Pac and the strong recovery in the U.S. And then in terms of the U.S. for your question there, we really had with the exception of EP, we think every business globally and the U.S. grew double-digit organically versus '19 and likely gained share in the respective markets with the exception of potentially EP and CRM. But EP grew share international markets. And in the -- if you break down -- if you look at UroPH and Endo particularly Alpha PI where we have a more substantial ASC business and outpatient business, you saw 16% growth in UroPH, 15% in Endo and 10% organic in PI with a strong growth from Therasphere. So I would say in the U.S., we saw a nice rebound, both in the hospital setting, which I think has been verified by many of the public company hospital chains reporting prior to us. And we saw strong growth in the outpatient ASC center as well.

Q - Robert Marcus{BIO 18720787 <GO>}
Great. And maybe a follow-up for Dan and a suggestion. Dan, I think some of us had a little trouble hearing the nuance guidance you gave. If you guys want to send out your prepared remarks, I think that be really helpful for all the investors. But maybe just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned higher input costs in COGS. So improving in second half versus first half, but maybe not all the way quite up to 2019, you know, how are you thinking about the company's ability to absorb and pass on some of those costs? And do you think that's going to be an issue going into 2022 as we exit the year here, because you did have great expense control down the P&L, just thinking about the cost component. Thanks.

A - Daniel J. Brennan{BIO 15138161 <GO>}
Sure. Thanks, Robbie. Relative to gross margin, so we average 69.8 in the first half and I think we feel comfortable that we'll improve upon that here in the second half of '21. Specific to what's going on in gross margin, we will have the tailwind of the COVID-related variances that we put on the balance sheet during 2020, those are amortized over your inventory turns. And so effectively as of 6/30 this year, the end of Q2, those are gone, so that's good news. We do still have some COVID specific lingering costs of running plants in a COVID environment. So COVID is not completely done obviously as you know. And so, we do have those and those are adding cost. And then as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, not unique to us, we do have some pockets of inflation and particularly with freight where we just need more commercial airliners to be flying than are flying today, we have wage pressure in certain locations. And then direct materials, particularly precious metals and things like that we're seeing inflation there. So we do have some headwinds. But overall as we look at the back half of '21, we would assume we would improve versus that 69.8 average in the first half. And then as it relates to '22 and beyond, I would envision we'll give you more detailed review of that in Investor Day on the 22nd of September.

Q - Robert Marcus{BIO 18720787 <GO>}
Great. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot.

A - Daniel J. Brennan{BIO 15138161 <GO>}
Yes, thanks, Robbie.

Operator
The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Q - Lawrence Biegelsen{BIO 7539249 <GO>}
Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter and congrats to Lauren. Just one follow-up on the investor meeting in September. Maybe Dan or Mike just level set us kind of what we should expect, should -- will you provide an update to your financial goals and pipeline? And any reason to think the algorithm of 6% to 8% sales and 50 basis points to 100 basis points margin improvement with double-digit EPS growth has changed and I have one follow-up.

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
Oh my gosh, if we give you all this, you're not going to show up.

Q - Lawrence Biegelsen{BIO 7539249 <GO>}
We'll be there, Mike.

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
No, we expect to -- as we've done in previous years, provide an update on our portfolio across the company, give some visibility to the loan rate strategy and financial goals, similar to what we've done historically. So we would like to provide some more updated 3 year sales guidance, what we think margin approval [ph] will look like. But more importantly, you'll hear from the business unit presidents on the portfolio and innovation across the company.

Q - Lawrence Biegelsen{BIO 7539249 <GO>}
Got it. And just for my follow up, Mike on Lumenis and Farapulse, why was this the right time to acquire both? What's the outlook for Lumenis, since that $200 million you said for sales in 2021, is that net after your distribution agreement? Thanks for taking the questions.

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
Yes, I have to verify that number. We'll get the (inaudible), in terms of the Lumenis net numbers. So we'll -- let's circle back on that one, but the timing just strategically, makes perfect sense. I think that Group is aware that, yeah, we had distribution agreement with Lumenis in the U.S., distribution agreement in China, which was effective, but therefore we weren't getting the same level of gross margin benefit that we wanted, nor could we innovate in the platform. And I guess tie it more comprehensively into our StoneSmart platform. So by owning it, we obviously improve our gross margins, we can drive a more robust product roadmap within our StoneSmart ecosystem. And then we can expand our direct coverage in Europe and especially in China we'll have a very big business. So that makes sense.

And what did we say here, Lauren?

A - Lauren Tengler
We only disclosed the full year growth number of $200 million for 2021, we did not disclose the net, Larry.

Q - Lawrence Biegelsen{BIO 7539249 <GO>}
Got it. And Farapulse, Mike?

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
So Farapulse, we expect that to close pretty soon here, early in the third quarter. I won't go too far on it. We're really excited about, certainly approved platform in Europe in the pulsed field ablation field. And they are enrolling ahead of schedule in our U.S. clinical trial, the physician community and Dr. Stein is on the phone, he can comment on it. I don't know Ken if you -- Dr. Stein, if you're on the phone, maybe you want to provide a quick update on Farapulse.

A - Ken Stein{BIO 16485938 <GO>}
Yes, absolutely, Mike. Yeah, and I think the pulsed field ablation, and particularly the Farapulse approach to pulse field ablation is the most exciting thing to come along in ablation really since ablation. What Farapulse has demonstrated in a wealth of clinical data to date over 100 patients in clinical trials that have been reported out publicly is a very high expectation that this is going to be safer than others thermal approaches to ablation. And because of the safety, it's much more straightforward procedure for physicians. It's a quicker procedure for physicians and is that again likely to be at least as effective and probably more effective than other technologies.

So given that we are extremely excited and optimistic about their approach. And as Mike said, given that they are the only approved technology in Europe, given that they're executing so well on their clinical trials, by exercising the option now and again hopefully closing in the near future, we have the opportunity to now to help them scale up distribution, production and again the ability to help them and continue to execute their clinical trials and get to U.S. approval in a timely fashion.

Q - Lawrence Biegelsen{BIO 7539249 <GO>}
Thank you.

A - Ken Stein{BIO 16485938 <GO>}

The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.

Q - Vijay Kumar{BIO 17881836 <GO>}
Hi, Mike, congrats on the quarter here. Thanks for taking my question. One on a high level, if I just look at the 2Q performance and the back half implied guide, we did 9% in 2Q versus pre-pandemic 2019 back half implied is 7% and 9%. I mean we're already running, if I look at the 2Q to 4Q performance, we're already running well north of 8%. Preventice, Lumenis, once these deals become organic, they should be incremental, plus you have these pipelines, I guess when I look at the LRP of 6% to 8%, shouldn't these results provide a high degree of confidence in upper end of that LRP on the top line going forward?

A - Daniel J. Brennan{BIO 15138161 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, I think we're not going to comment specifically within the range of 6% to 8%. Obviously will -- as Mike said, probably tee that up for an Investor Day conversation relative to the portfolio and the overall results. So I don't think it would serve us well to comment relative to the specifics in there. But the strength of the portfolio in the pipeline is what's given us the confidence to put up the numbers that we put up in the past. And obviously looking forward, give us the confidence in the revenue growth trajectory for the future. So -- but specific to where in the range, I don't think I'll go there.

Q - Vijay Kumar{BIO 17881836 <GO>}
Understood Dan. Just one on the margins may be, when should gross margins get back to pre-pandemic levels or perhaps on operating margins just given the commentary around freight, inflationary pressures, should '22 operating margins be at 2019 levels?

A - Daniel J. Brennan{BIO 15138161 <GO>}
Yes, I mean, if you think of the back half of this year, that's what we're calling for, Vijay. So we're calling for an average in the back half of '21 to be at our full year 2019 level, which was call it rounded 26%. So the goal is to do that in the back half of '21 and set us up for '22 and beyond. Gross margin, as we said, it was 69.8 in the first half, it will be improving on that in the second half. So when does that get back to specific 2019 level, we'll -- again we'll give more details at Investor Day. But if you think of at the overall operating margin level, the thing that we've proven time and time again over history is that we make the effective trade-offs through the P&L. So if you think back 4, 5, 6 years ago, gross margin was growing very nicely and as a percentage of sale and we were investing in places like the emerging markets and other areas. So SG&A was in sometimes actually increasing as a percentage of sale. But still delivered very solid operating margin progression through that time frame. So it may shift a little bit as we go forward, maybe gross margin doesn't pay as many of the bill so to speak. But SG&A potentially with lower travel spend and other trade-offs that will make in addition to more efficient R&D spend, the goal is always to have operating margins increase year-over-year. And I think our track record speaks for itself on that.

Q - Vijay Kumar{BIO 17881836 <GO>}
Thanks, Dan.

A - Daniel J. Brennan{BIO 15138161 <GO>}

The next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Cecilia Furlong{BIO 22236227 <GO>}
Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to ask about SCS trialing trends. And really just what you've seen from a relative recovery versus other more elective procedures in the quarter. And then kind of tie-in also just Vertiflex, what type of traction you've seen recently?

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
Sure. We haven't had all the competitors report in that field. So we're not exactly sure how we grew versus the competitive set. But we had a strong acceleration in 2Q U.S. overall in the quarter. And I think part of it is the combination of the unique portfolio that we have with the new launches. The new fast algorithms and I detailed in the script that may have had difficult hearing, we're going to send them out to people. But combination of the new fast algorithms, as well as the clinical work that we're doing. So SCS overall improved versus first quarter. And then it was augmented, as you mentioned with Vertiflex growth in the quarter as well as continued growth in our RF portfolio. The RF portfolio, although a bit smaller continues to exceed expectations.

And then the other really big growth driver for Neuromod in the quarter was our Deep Brain Stimulation business. And it's really impressive what that group has done. They continue to gain market share, really the number one de novo player in Europe and close to that now in the U.S. and they continue to accelerate market share gains through the innovation of that business. So the DBS probably had the largest snap back of any business in the second quarter with the COVID impact waning in the U.S. But overall the SCS market in the pain side did quite well as well. But we'll see how the other competitors report, but we're impressed with the sequential growth that we saw.

A - Daniel J. Brennan{BIO 15138161 <GO>}
Yeah, and happy overall with the 14% growth versus 2019 for all of that Neuromod business that Mike just detailed.

Q - Cecilia Furlong{BIO 22236227 <GO>}
Great. And you also called out Rezum in your prepared remarks, could you just comment a bit more just what you've seen from recent procedure trends and procedure recovery trajectory coming out of COVID? Thank you.

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
Yeah, so I think with our Rezum business, we continue to drive increased growth there. The overall UroPH business had a big bounce back in the quarter, growing 16%. And the big things that we're focused now with Rezum is we continue to drive improved reimbursement rates with some of the specific payers, which is helping. But it's also the long-term durability data and that's giving physicians more confidence in the product, that's driving the growth. And we've also expanding our international footprint with the Rezum, particularly in Europe. And also some additional DTP direct-to-patient and direct-to-physician marketing campaigns to drive more awareness. So it's really a combination of all those things that's improving the growth profile of Rezum.

Q - Cecilia Furlong{BIO 22236227 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. And congrats on the quarter.

The next question comes from, excuse me, Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Pito Chickering{BIO 20828822 <GO>}
Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a nice quarter and also congrats to Lauren. To follow up on Bob's question, I understand the comps versus 2018 for 3Q is (inaudible). But we also heard from the public hospitals that June is the best month of the quarter and strong June trends continue into July. So just curious as you look at your third quarter guidance, are you seeing normal 3Q seasonality or are you simply assuming that you'll see at some point during the quarter.

A - Daniel J. Brennan{BIO 15138161 <GO>}
Yeah, I appreciate the question. We're just not going to comment kind of intra-quarter as we sit here in the third quarter. I think the answer to Bob's question in the short answer is, we're expecting the trends that we saw in the second quarter to continue. We're not going to parse it month by month, we're expecting the overall trend of that growth rate to continue comp adjusted in the back half of '21. But specific to month versus month, we're not going to get into that, those specifics.

Q - Pito Chickering{BIO 20828822 <GO>}
Okay, fair enough. A quick question on EXALT D, I understand the markets have been pretty dynamic sort of last years or due to COVID. So two questions, how many accounts you're selling EXALT D into this point. In those accounts what is the market share and the order rate of those accounts. And as you watch EXALT B, how much revenue contribution should we assume in the back half of the year? Thanks so much.

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
Yeah, we're probably frustrating you. And we're not prepared to share that information with you. On EXALT D, just as you've heard in previous quarterly updates, the team continues to make progress. As COVID impact is improving, although hopefully Delta variant isn't too much, but has improved in the U.S., we have seen more of an uptick in traction with EXALT D. As physicians are becoming more comfortable with it, the training and the capital placements have gone well. So you're seeing a uptick in EXALT D usage. And then in the second half of '21, you'll see a enhancement in next release or next-generation release, if you will, of EXALT D to further improve the platform. So we expect to see continued momentum with that.

The big news for us is the recent approval of EXALT B and some sites that tried it for the first time in Europe. And we're really bullish on that platform. That's an established market with a few competitors, but we think we have some differentiated capabilities with EXALT B. And so, in the second half of '21 and much more so in '22, you'll see the impact of that platform as well. So it's all going to plan, but we're seeing some improved momentum with EXALT D in the U.S. as COVID is improving.

The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please...

Q - Joanne Wuensch{BIO 2379289 <GO>}
Hi, can you hear me okay?

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
We can. Good morning, Joanne.

A - Daniel J. Brennan{BIO 15138161 <GO>}
Good morning, Joanne.

Q - Joanne Wuensch{BIO 2379289 <GO>}
Excellent. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. It looked to us like when we compared the delivery versus consensus, the two areas that might be lagging a little bit are EP and CRM. But I also remember that there are a number of key products in those sections. Can you highlight one or two that might bring you back into sort of the market-taker or gain position?

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
Yeah, well you nailed it, we think each -- every one of our businesses with exception -- while EP grew double digits versus '19, but likely globally that's below market. And CRM, we think grew a little bit below market. With the exception of those two, we think every other one grew faster than market. On EP, I think you'll see a similar trend likely for the next couple of years. And that we expect the -- our EP results in the international markets to exceed market growth, which we think they did in second quarter. On the heels of our cryo platform, where with this -- now the only competitor to it the established player in cryo and we're taking share there. And then our STABLEPOINT, which is our force-sensing catheters approved in Europe.

And as previous question, we'll be closing the Farapulse deal in early third quarter and they're commercial in Europe. So the three distinct technologies that are quite differentiated will be our IRE platform with Farapulse. (inaudible), our cryo and STABLEPOINT in Europe. And we also expect to see benefit of cryo in Japan towards the second -- towards the end of '21 and full-year '22. So our International business, which is now bigger than our U.S. business in EP will grow faster than market and our U.S. business will likely lag market until we get those products approved. And all those products are in clinical trial right now. And thankfully as COVID has improved, the clinical trial run rates of those platforms have increased significantly over the past 100 days. So that will be the balance in EP, really strong outside the U.S. less so in the U.S. likely for the coming earnings calls.

In CRM, we think our performance in the second half of this year will improve versus what you saw in second quarter. And the primary reason for that is the S-ICD advisory that we had, which caused sales to lag a bit in the S-ICD segment for us, which is a big segment for us globally. And now we have a new lead that is being implanted now across in Europe and the U.S. And we expect our third quarter and fourth quarter S-ICD results to improve quite a bit versus second quarter, which will improve the overall growth rate of our CRM business and likely take us closer to market growth rates for all of CRM.

Q - Joanne Wuensch{BIO 2379289 <GO>}
Thank you. And my second question also is product related, if I had to say to you, what are the three products you want us to focus on over the next 6 months to 12 months, what would your answer be?

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
If only I picked three, I think WATCHMAN is number one given the scale of it, the growth profile we see, and this enthusiasm. I would say within PI, the BTG acquisition has got exceeded expectations. And the TheraSphere segment within particular in Varithena doing extremely well. And then if you give me a third one, there's lots of different areas to speak through, I think, yeah, I think just overall in the -- I know it's super early, we're very bullish on the combination of cryo and Farapulse, although not in the U.S. yet, that market is so large and the growth profile of EP is so good, that we'll be the only company that will have IRE and cryo and force-sensing. So although smaller dollars now, exciting opportunity for us.

A - Daniel J. Brennan{BIO 15138161 <GO>}
Are you there, Travis?

Operator
Excuse me, Mr. Steed, your line is open.

Q - Travis Steed{BIO 18228465 <GO>}
All right, good morning. Thanks for the question. I appreciate some of the longer-term comments you gave on operating margins, just curious what the base we should be using for that 50% or 50 basis points of margin expansion per year if we should think about that 26% in the back half here. So thinking about the street somewhere in 26.5%, next year would be a reasonable place to be at this point?

A - Daniel J. Brennan{BIO 15138161 <GO>}
Yes, I wouldn't comment on '22. But for '21, I think the reasonable basis as a starting point would be that 26%, that's what we're kind of resetting to here in the back half, it's where we were in 2019. And it should be a nice jumping-off point for 2022. Yes, I would agree with you there, Travis.

Q - Travis Steed{BIO 18228465 <GO>}
Okay, great. And then I just wanted to make sure the message was clear on the full-year guidance and the guidance raise. So you're going from 2% to 5% for the full year versus 2019 to 6% to 7%. Is that all coming from the Q2 beat. And so, basically the back half, expectations are staying the same or are you actually seeing more confidence here in the back half versus your original expectations?

A - Michael F. Mahoney{BIO 16355514 <GO>}
No, I think if you go back to the original guidance back in February and for the most part reiterated in April, it was COVID impact in Q1, less COVID impact in Q2. And then a more -- a return to more normalized procedure volumes in Q3 and Q4, I think we got a little bit of that early as our results would point to versus our guidance ranges for Q2. And then if you take what we're saying about the back half, which we say is the same type of COVID impact and pretty much the same type of results in Q3 and Q4 as in Q2, it's a broad-base story of Q2, Q3, Q4. It's not just Q2.
