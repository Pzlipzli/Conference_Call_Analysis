Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Thanks, Mac. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We're off to a strong start to the year and believe our businesses are on track to deliver against their full-year plans. Against a challenging comparison, our tobacco businesses performed well in the first quarter and we continue to make progress advancing our noncombustible product portfolio. This morning we announced another important milestone in Altria's journey to move beyond smoking. We now have full global ownership of On! oral nicotine pouches as we recently closed transactions to acquire the remaining 20% global interest. We are excited about the opportunity we have with on to convert smokers and we have talented team supporting the global plans for the brand. Before discussing our first quarter results in more detail, we would like to honor the memory of Tom Farrell, our late Chairman of the Board. Tom served 13 distinguished years on our Board, offered valuable insights and guidance during his tenure and was a true visionary. We will miss his leadership, contributions and friendship. The Board will appoint a new chair at its meeting following our Annual Shareholders Meeting in May. Let's now turn to our first quarter results.

Our first quarter adjusted diluted EPS declined 1.8%, primarily driven by unfavorable timing of interest expense and a higher adjusted income tax rate. In the smokeable products segment, we continue to execute our strategy of maximizing profitability and combustibles while appropriately balancing investments in Marlboro with funding the growth of noncombustible products. Segment adjusted OCI margins expanded and Marvel continued its retail share momentum from the back half of 2020. For volumes, reported smokeable segment domestic cigarette volume declined 12% in the first quarter reflecting year-over-year trade inventory movements, one fewer shipping day and other factors. When adjusted for these factors, cigarette volume declined by an estimated 3.5%. We believe that in the first quarter of 2020, wholesalers built inventories by approximately 900 million units, driven in part by COVID-19 dynamics compared with the depletion of approximately 300 million units in the first quarter of 2021. At the industry level, we estimate that first quarter adjusted domestic cigarette volume declined 2%. Looking at smoker retail dynamics, we estimated that total cigarette trips in the first quarter remained below pre-pandemic levels. Also, estimated expenditures per trip remained elevated when compared to pre-pandemic levels and we're steadying sequentially. We are continuing to monitor the impacts from external factors from tobacco consumer purchasing patterns and behavior. In March, the Federal Government passed a third stimulus package. An increasing number of people became vaccinated and consumer mobility improved sharply. We're keeping a close eye on the tobacco consumer and we will continue to provide our insights on the underlying factors as the year progresses.

Moving to our noncombustible products, we are pleased to now have full ownership of On! oral nicotine pouches globally. We completed transactions in December and April to acquire the remaining 20% of the global on business for approximately $250 million. When we made the initial 80 percent acquisition in 2019, the oral nicotine pouch category in the US was rapidly growing off of a small base. Subsequently, oral nicotine pouch growth has exceeded our original estimates. In the first quarter of 2021, we estimate that retail share for oral nicotine pouches was approximately 13% of the total oral tobacco category double its share in the year ago period. We expect continued growth from the oral nicotine pouch products and estimate the category volume in the US will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 25% over the next 5 years. Since 2019, helix supported by the enterprise significantly increased on! manufacturing capacity, broadened retail distribution grew tobacco consumer awareness and PMTAs for the entire product portfolio. Helix achieved an annualized manufacturing capacity of 50 million cans by the end of last year and as of the end of the first quarter, on! was sold in approximately 93,000 stores. In the US market on!'s momentum continues, in the first quarter on!'s share of the total oral tobacco category grew significantly to 1.7%. On a 12-month moving basis, in-store selling and providing point of sale data on!'s retail share was 3.1%, an increase of 7 tenths from the 2020 full-year share. Going forward, we intend to report on!'s share of the total US all tobacco category as Helix expects to be in stores, covering 90% of the industries all tobacco volume by mid-year. Our primary focus continues to be on increasing on!'s growth in the US. Internationally, we see potential to strengthen on! in the Swedish market. We also see longer-term prospects in Europe to expand on! and gain consumer feedback on potential noncombustible products for the US. To explore these additional opportunities, we have expanded the international on! team. We believe on! presents a compelling noncombustible alternative for smokers and we look forward to supporting their conversion journey.

Moving to e-vapor, we estimate the total category volume increased 24% versus the year ago period. As a reminder, in Q1 2020, the FDA restricted the sales of all flavored e-vapor products among pod systems with the exception of tobacco and menthol. Sequentially, we estimate that the category volume increased 7% as competitive marketplace activity continued. As a result of these dynamics JUUL's first quarter retail share of the total e-vapor category decreased to 33%. We continue to believe that a responsible e-vapor category consisting solely of FDA authorized products can play an important role in tobacco harm reduction. As for our JUUL investment, the FTC trial is now scheduled for June of this year and we remain committed to vigorously defending our investment. In heated tobacco PM USA is continuing to expand IQOS and Marlboro HeatSticks. Beginning this month, HeatSticks are available at retail stores statewide across Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. HeatSticks retail volume and share continue to grow in the first quarter. In Atlanta stores with distribution MarlboroHeatSticks retail share of the cigarette category was 1.1%, an increase of 2 tenths sequentially and in Charlotte HeatSticks retail share was 1%, an increase of 3 tenths sequentially. Last month PM USA began selling the IQOS 3 device, which offers a longer battery life and faster recharging as compared to the 2.4 version. The new device is being offered through device and HeatSticks bundles and through the lending program, which has been effective at generating trials and driving purchase. We're encouraged to see that many consumers are upgrading their 2.4 devices, representing approximately 25% of all ICOS three device sales in the first quarter along with geographic expansion, PM USA is increasing the use of its digital platforms like Marlboro.com and get ICOS.com to engage with smokers and communicate the benefits of ICOS including the MRTP claim on the ICOS 2.4 system. On Marlboro.com ICOS continent now available nationwide. Smokers can find up to receive the indications and be notified with ICOS is available in the area. PM USA is also using its Marlboro's Rewards program to drive IQOS awareness and value delivered. smokers can earn Marlboro (inaudible) point by learning about IQOS and can also redeem their points for discounts on the IQOS device. In June PM USA plans to open IQOS [ph] Reddit in the (inaudible) all, which is a third point for the highly populated northern Virginia metro area outside of Washington DC. As a reminder, PM USA plans to expand IQOS at its three additional metro markets throughout the year and to expand the availability of Marlboro HeatSticks to geography's covering approximately 25% of the US cigarette volume by year-end.

We are making progress in driving awareness and availability of on! at IQOS. While investing in future innovative noncombustible products and we continue to acquire more tobacco consumer insights to inform our strategies to actively transitioning smokers to our noncombustible portfolio.

Our smoker smokeable product segment continues to support our vision, generating significant cash that can be invested in noncombustible products and return to shareholders.

Turning to our financial outlook, we reaffirm our 2021 guidance to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $4.49 to $4.62. This range represents an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020.

The guidance includes continued investments to support the transition of adult smokers to a noncombustible future. We will continue to monitor various factors that could impact our guidance. Our employees continue to drive the success of our businesses. They risen to the challenge together to deliver results and are supporting each other and their communities. Over the past years, the challenges associated with the pandemic have been compounded by the continued social injustice and in equities that black and brown Americans still face everyday.

And the Asian American community is hurt as violent and hateful attacks on Asian skyrocket. We can dim any form of hatred and discrimination against any person to our Asian, black and brown employees, we will continue to stay with you and we stand for you. We recently released our report on supporting our people and communities, which details the many ways we're making progress, enhancing our culture and positively impacting our communities.

It is part of a series of Corporate Responsibility Progress reports that we are issuing this year and it is available on Altria.com. I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more details on our first quarter results.

Sal Mancuso{BIO 16621943 <GO>}
Thanks. Billy. I echo your sentiments and to our employees, thank you for all you do. Moving to our results, our tobacco businesses continue to perform well in the first quarter. The smokeable product segment delivered over $2.3 billion in adjusted OCI and expanded adjusted OCI margins by 2.2 percentage points to 57.5%.

PM USA's revenue growth management framework supported this segment's strong net price realization of 8% for the quarter. We continue to be pleased with Marlboro's performance in category leadership. in the first quarter Marlboro's retail share was 43.1%, an increase of 4 tenths versus prior year. We believe that Marlboro is continuing to benefit from smoker preferences for familiar products during disruptive times and is lapping the year-ago comparison quarter where we observed that older consumers coming back to cigarettes from e-vapor.

In the first quarter, Marlboro's price gap to the lowest effective price cigarette increased to 37% primarily driven by heavy competitive promotional activity in the branded discount segment. Despite this activity, branded discount share declined by 4 tenths in the first quarter as deep discount gain share. The total discount segment retail share was 25.3%, an increase of one 10th versus the year ago period. In cigars, Black & Mild continues its longstanding leadership in the profitable tip cigar segment. Middleton's reported cigar shipment volume increased over 11% in the first quarter.

Turning to non-combustibles, oral tobacco products segment adjusted OCI grew by 3.1% and adjusted OCI margins declined by 0.9 percentage points to 72.1 percent. Adjusted OCI results were driven primarily by higher pricing, partially offset by higher investments behind on!.

Total reported oral tobacco products segment volume increased 0.6% driven by on! when adjusted for trade inventory movements, calendar differences and other factors, segment volume increased by an estimated 0.5%.

First quarter retail share for the oral tobacco product segment was 48.1% down 2.3 percentage points. Due to the continued growth of oral nicotine pouches. Copenhagen, continue to be the leading MST brand and on! gained traction in the oral nicotine pouches.

In alcohol, St Michelle's first quarter adjusted OCI increased approximately 46% to $19 million, driven primarily by higher pricing and lower costs.

And in beer, we recorded $190 million of adjusted equity earnings in the first quarter which was unchanged from the year ago period. And represents Altria's share of ABIs 4th Quarter 2020 results.

Moving to our equity investment in Cronos, we recorded an adjusted loss of $27 million representing Altria's share of Cronos is 4th quarter 2020 results. We continue to support our investment in Cronos by advocating for a federally legal regulated and responsible US cannabis market. We join the recently launched Coalition for cannabis policy education and regulation. This coalition is comprised of members across diverse industries and public policy experts who plan to inform the development of comprehensive cannabis policy that prevents underage use, advances science, creates quality and safety standards and addresses social inequality [ph].

And finally, on capital allocation, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately $6.9 million shares, totaling $325 million in the first quarter. We have approximately $1.7 billion remaining under the currently authorized $2 billion share buyback program, which we expect to complete by June 30, 2022.

Our balance sheet remains strong. And as of the end of the first quarter, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.5 times. In the first quarter, we executed a series of transactions to take advantage of favorable market conditions to adjust our debt maturity profile and extend the weighted average maturity of our debt. We issued new long-term notes totaling $5.5 billion and repurchased over $5 billion in outstanding long-term notes. In May, we expect to retire $1.5 billion of notes coming due with available cash. With that we'll wrap up and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items. Let's open the question and answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. Once again as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press the star key followed by the number one on your touch tone phone at this time. Investors, analysts and media representatives are now invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question comes from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley.

Q - Pamela Kaufman{BIO 18021242 <GO>}
Good morning, thanks for the question. I wanted to see if you could comment on what you're seeing with respect to smoker behavior as things begin to reopen and how you're thinking about the industry volume performance throughout 2021?

And do you expect to see elevated consumption and cigarettes per day continue throughout this year?

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, good morning, Pamela. Thanks for the question. You ask a good one, because the market is very fluid as we mentioned in our remarks, I think when you look at the first quarter and we provided a 12-month moving (inaudible), you can see that we still have somewhat of a tailwind and we believed, as we believe that the end of last year that is the consumer stay at home practices as they had in nicotine occasions to their day.

Certainly as we progress forward, we highlighted that we are seeing mobility for our consumers increased significantly, but then you also have the offsets you have the --government stimulus that just came out and we'll see how the consumer thinks about that as the mobility has increased and what other areas of discretionary spend, they could use that stimulus towards. So, certainly through the first quarter, we saw a continuance, even though it was a tough comp, a continuance of what we saw at the end of last year, I think it remains to be same, what trends the consumer has picked up during the COVID pandemic that will remain and what we will revert back at and I'll use your phrase to pre-pandemic or or normal levels that they had in place prior to the pandemic, but thanks for the question.

Q - Pamela Kaufman{BIO 18021242 <GO>}
Sure. Other and also obviously regulation is top of mind for investors, given all of the headlines in recent weeks, can you discuss your view of the current regulatory backdrop and what you might be anticipating from the FDA, and then separately, your thoughts on the FET proposal from last week.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, I think when you think about the regulatory framework, the 2 topics that have been in the headlines and look, we expect to have continued headline news and the tobacco industry as you have a new administration that tends to take place.

But let's just take them in turn if you think about menthol. The FDA has been considering this for years and when you step back from it and you really think about it, we have a common goal, which is to transition the adult cigarette consumer to a noncombustible future. Where we disagree is prohibition just doesn't work. It has unintended consequences and criminalizing menthol has significant consequences. We think a better approach is to have an established marketplace of FDA authorized noncombustible products. We've only heard what you've heard.

So certainly, whatever the FDA analysis, we will review what the FDA announces and then we'll engage and in and continue to focus on the science and evidence of what would be a multi-year process.

I think when you think about lower nicotine in cigarettes, it's very similar. It's something they brings to sitting for years we know they're running studies related to this.

Again, we don't believe prohibition works because it has so many unintended consequences, the better approach is to have that established portfolio of FDA authorized noncombustible products. In addition to that, we don't think it's practical or feasible from a standpoint of what's been suggested. And so when you look at overall the science and evidence, you can see the comments that we submitted to the FDA as they were considering these previously, they are significant hurdles there from a science and evidence base that it has the impact that they have suggested. From an FE standpoint, I think, it remains to be same. There hasn't been a lot of discussion as you mentioned, it was a bit of a headline news last week. When you step back from the specifics, it's something that's been introduced before and it didn't get very far. I think when you think about some of the statements that President Biden has made about not wanting to raise taxes on individuals making less than 400,000 a year, but excise tax increased, runs color to that. you know i just remind when we have an excellent government affairs team is ready to engage in all of these topics in our regulatory affairs team as well. so, we are ready, but we cautioned that we will see, we believe continued headline moves.

Your next question is from Vivien Azer with Cowen.

Q - Vivien Azer{BIO 16513330 <GO>}
Hi, good morning.

A - Sal Mancuso{BIO 16621943 <GO>}
Good morning Vivien.

Q - Vivien Azer{BIO 16513330 <GO>}
Thank you very much for the more detailed outlook in terms of your growth expectations for the Modern Oral category. I was hoping to expand on that 5-year CAGR outlook, and I just understand what your underlying assumptions are in terms of cross category engagement and if you can offer any detail around how you're thinking about competitive reduced risk categories. Thanks.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Sure. Thanks for the question. Vivien. I think when you think about modern oral, it's a very exciting category we're extremely excited to now have a 100% of the economics of on! both in the US and on a global basis. When you think about the novel on!, I think it's very intuitive that it will interact with the adult differ from the traditional MST that consumer is used to putting things in the mouth. I think what has us so excited about on! is it's engagement with the adult cigarette consumer.

And so as we do always, we run various scenarios. I think certainly, you can see the adult dip converting to it and it depends on how successful we are engaging with the adult cigarette consumer of how big that category can get through time. So we're extremely excited and we'll be very excited to get past the manufacturing capacity constraint, which we expect to do by mid-year. I think from a competitive standpoint, you can expect that in new categories as volume grows that the various manufacturers that are participating in the category are trying to capture consumers and having choose their products and brands. Certainly through time. I think all companies are in it for profitability. So there will be some competitive activities as volume grows and consumers are at play and then you would expect for a turn towards profitability.

Q - Vivien Azer{BIO 16513330 <GO>}
That's really helpful. Thanks. And while we're happy to be the the cigarette cross category cigarette movement is a little bit more nascent relative to dip, does the the migration from cigarette smokers into the modern oral or novel oral category over-indexed to menthol smokers.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, I don't have those factors in front of me Vivien. I think when you think about it, certainly we've seen and we tried to have some of this available in previous presentations. It tends to have a higher than normal from the MST category interaction with the female cigarette consumers, because they just don't appreciate putting tobacco in their mouth. And so it's certainly over indexes to that a bit compared to MST, but from a standpoint of that interaction, I think right now, it's too early to tell. And it's very small when you try to diagnose who's coming over from the cigarette category.

Q - Vivien Azer{BIO 16513330 <GO>}
Understood. If I could squeeze one last one in. It's about the past training for the HeatSticks in the United States, can you just walk us through like what mechanisms would be necessary for the HeatStick's not to be [ph]taxes, the cigarette.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, I think the biggest one I would highlight Vivien is the activity that our government affairs team has been able to secure now in 7 states and with a different definition of HeatStick's in the State of Virginia. So a total of 8 and that is that a product that has a designation of MRTP coming out of the FDA that they have authorized it to have that claim has a step function down in excise taxes in 7 states. And again, the different definition in the State of Virginia. So I think that's going to be the best mechanism of any reduced risk product is those that have the designation of MRTP being authorized by the FDA.

Q - Vivien Azer{BIO 16513330 <GO>}
Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.

Q - Chris Growe{BIO 4034432 <GO>}
Hi, good morning.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Good morning, Chris.

Q - Chris Growe{BIO 4034432 <GO>}
So Billy I heard your commentary before about the transition in the consumer and it's a reduced risk products and as a backdrop for maybe perhaps the underlying factors in regulation. I guess, I'm curious by is if you think about the products that the FDA has approved so far there is reduced risk products has been 2 of them and it feels like, do you need to have a larger stable of products, and products that consumers aware of before they could ever really implement significant regulation at the risk of creating unintended consequences. That's obviously my opinion, but I just want to get your, your thoughts on that. And I guess with that backdrop, does that influence or define the timetable, the FDA has to pursue this regulation got a lot more work to do, it seems like on approving new products before they move forward with regulation.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
So we would agree with your opinion. Chris that that's the appropriate way to do it is you remember a call it roughly half of the conventional cigarette consumers are looking for a noncombustible product that satisfies them and certainly something that would reduce risk through time and so certainly focusing on having a robust portfolio of noncombustible products that are authorized by the FDA and then eventually receive an MRTP, the cigarette consumers will move. They just need those products that satisfy them and meet their needs. And so certainly add to your point, prohibition tends to be fraught with unintended consequences that can take place based on provision.

Q - Chris Growe{BIO 4034432 <GO>}
Yeah, okay. And then I just one other question, I know your pricing over the last few months, over the last year. It's a little different from some of your competitors, especially in the in the premium side and I'm just curious as you look at retail today, is there been any meaningful change in price gaps? I know we always look at it versus the lowest priced product in the market. But I'm talking about amongst the kind of premium brands. Have you seen any real deviation in the price gaps in those products, Marlboro versus other products.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, nothing that out our highlight Chris. We make our pricing decisions independent. I think when you look at price realization in the first quarter of 8% that's pretty substantial and it shows in the total results of the company, Marlboro's rock solid, you mentioned the price gap to lowest that was really driven by major manufacturer and being very competitive in the branded discount category and we highlighted that it didn't seem to gain a lot of attraction. So you always have a lot of movement through time and in various periods that you look at, but nothing that I would highlight that substantial.

Q - Chris Growe{BIO 4034432 <GO>}
Okay, thank you for your time today.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}

Your next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Bonnie Herzog{BIO 1840179 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning, everyone.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Good morning Bonnie.

Q - Bonnie Herzog{BIO 1840179 <GO>}
And good morning. I actually wanted to circle back on your oral tobacco business. And just looking at the performance over the last several quarters and years. Volume growth really has remained negative. So I guess I'm. I'm trying to understand, ultimately how incremental, do you anticipate on! can be for you? I guess I'm wondering why we haven't maybe seen more of a lift on your total oral tobacco volume yet. Has this been more of a capacity constraint issue in the last few quarters or has the cannibalization being greater maybe than you anticipated. So that would be helpful. If we could just hear some color on that. And then, because you purchased on! outright, how should we think about the potential global opportunity for that business. Thanks.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks for the question, Bonnie and I'll try to take them in turn. But if I miss one follow back up. I think when you think about the growth in the category, certainly, we had a competitor had a great head start on us, we've seen significant growth in the category. We have been constrained from a capacity and manufacturing. And so we look to be passed that at mid-year and then we can have it in the stores we want it to be in and engage with the consumer the way we would like to engage with the consumer. I think for the upside from a total standpoint of growth, I think we are excited about on! because not only is it engaging with the adult dipper, but as I mentioned, also engaging with the adult smoker. So the more successful we are with that, you can see the size of the consumer base that you're able to engage with. I think your question related to international. It's important to remember that on! already had a presence internationally, so we highlighted in our remarks, we're going to certainly pay attention, where it's it's at in market, make sure that we have the right look in the right products in the marketplace, introduce products that are in the pipeline through time and then we'll look at what other opportunities we have, and we've increased the international team supplementing what was already existing with some outreach employees to get consumer insights, both for the international market, but as well as to get consumer insights for future products in the US.

Q - Bonnie Herzog{BIO 1840179 <GO>}
Okay, that's helpful. That's what I was thinking that could be a nice opportunity on!. I did want to ask also, if I could on[ph] IQOS and MRT in the marketing plan as it relates to that. I think you touched on this a bit, but I just wanted to see if there's anything more you could share on really how your marketing and communicating with consumers, given the fact that I could just have the MRTP. I think you even mentioned last quarter that you started to do some of this in certain markets. So let me hear any feedback on that in terms of how consumers have responded, has it, helped to drive trial or conversion in some of those markets. I think that would be helpful. Thank you.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Sure. Thanks for the question, Bonnie. Yeah, it's still a bit early yet, but certainly we're looking to engage with the consumer, both at retail through guided trials through the HeatSticks at C stores. But just as importantly and that was part of our investments, we highlighted at the beginning of the year is investing and what we would consider industry-leading consumer engagement system and it really being able to engage with the consumer digitally, so that we can connect with the consumer, if you think about it not only when they're in the store, but from a 360 view of when they want to be engaged with and that's what we're really on the path to do. I think from the standpoint of highlighting what the claim does is certainly in research, it was, it showed that the consumer once they understood the claim that was there is that they were more inclined to both engage with the product and understand it as well as try the product. So we'll have more to share as we move through the year.

Q - Bonnie Herzog{BIO 1840179 <GO>}
Okay. That definitely makes sense and would be great. Appreciate it. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.

Q - Priya Ohri-Gupta{BIO 15889787 <GO>}
(inaudble), I was hoping that we could just talk a little bit about your elevated cash balance and how we should think about that trending through the year given the various puts and takes, understanding that you've already identified an intent to repay that may maturity that you have coming up, but are there other sort of pieces that we should be mindful of as we look out and where do you expect to [ph] drive land that cash balance as we get into 2020. Thank you.

A - Sal Mancuso{BIO 16621943 <GO>}
Good morning Priya. This is Sal. And thank you for the question. You know at the end of the first quarter you did see an elevated cash balance, as I stated in my opening remarks. And you talk you spoke to me. We do plan on paying the debt coming due with cash available. I'll also remind you of by some rather large payments we have, post the first quarter, which include our Master Settlement Agreement payment, our quarterly taxes, our dividend. So that cash begins to get depleted in April and May, as we make those payments and Of course, we still have our share buyback program in place.

Your next question comes from Owen Bennett with Jefferies.

Q - Owen Bennett{BIO 17329607 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone. So I wanted to follow up on a comment by PM its recent results that it plans to submit a PMTA in the US at some point and so, to me, I mean, it does appear clear that we will be returning to a global competitive environment going forward. So I was just wondering, how does this make you think about the need to have full control of a vapor business in the US or indeed globally and then linked to this especially now you've expanding with more than oral globally, how are you thinking about the need to your on! (inaudible) tobacco products on a global basis. Thank you.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks for the question. Owen, and I'll be careful not to talk about anything from a merger, acquisition or anything in the future. I think the way we think about it is, we are primarily US focused, because we have all of our infrastructure sales force, relationships with retailers and wholesalers are all primarily US focused. And so that will be our focus of getting those consumers in their conversion journey from combustible to noncombustible that will be our primary focus. But the learnings that we have and you mentioned modern oral, the learnings that we have in the conversion journey that consumers take is very similar to consumers around the world. And so we certainly want to pay attention to that and participate that in that when it's appropriate. I think from a standpoint of the comments made by PMI, they probably better directed to PMI but certainly our primary focus is US. But we'll certainly seize on opportunities when appropriate around the globe.

Your next question comes from Gaurav Jain with Barclays.

Q - Gaurav Jain{BIO 20455166 <GO>}
Good morning. Thank you. So my question is on JUUL, so your investment in JUUL is now valued at about $1.5 billion and if you could just remind us that is value falls below 10% which would be about $1.3 billion you would be out of the non-compete clause of JUUL. So how should one think off of the valuation that you are now if scribing to JUUL.

A - Sal Mancuso{BIO 16621943 <GO>}
Thank you for the question. This is, Sal. First, let me just state when we do our valuation analysis that is independent of any agreement we have, as it pertains to the JUUL ownership. You are correct that if the valuation were to drop below 10% of the original investment, which is slightly below $1.3 billion, we would have an option, as it relates to our non-compete. But with that option comes from other minority investor rates we have. So it is not an automatic trigger. It is something that we as a management team would obviously have to analyze and discuss.

Q - Gaurav Jain{BIO 20455166 <GO>}
Okay, thank you. My second question is on the oral tobacco market growth, where you are saying that for the next 5 years the market will grow at 25% CAGR. And if I look at just the 6-month data that you shared, it seems to be progressively decelerating over the last 9 months. So is there any seasonality in the business or is it just becoming bigger and bigger, so law of large numbers of applying or how should I think of these deceleration in oral tobacco market growth?

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, I think when you look at that, what you're seeing is you're exactly right. The larger the base gets certainly from a mathematic standpoint, the growth rate reduces, I would remind you when we show all tobacco, that's the total category. So that's MST and a novel oral pouches and so you've got a total look at that growth of the category over the last 6 months, So you're going to have some cannibalization of traditional moist smokeless tobacco as novel oral pouches grow, but you're also correct. As I mentioned, just as the base gets larger or novel oral,the growth rate slows.

Q - Gaurav Jain{BIO 20455166 <GO>}
Sure. thanks. And if I could just squeeze in one last question. Look at any of is to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a noncombustible future, which requires a lot of regulatory support and regulators are right now planning our menthol cigarette ban process again, which you would be opposing. But, would you be more supportive of some of these initiatives if at the same time a regulatory pathways created that helps you achieve your vision.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Certainly, we are looking for a regulatory pathway that helps us achieve the vision. You heard my earlier remarks on and not right prohibition whether it'd be menthol or great reduction in nicotine, we've, in cigarette, we believe having that portfolio of noncombustible that's authorized by the FDA and then eventually through the MRTP process is a much better pathway because the consumer that uses conventional cigarette has already shown an inclination that they want to transition and so we believe we can get there with the right products and with the insights we have on the consumer certainly having a regulatory pathway that allows that to happen in the right order makes perfect sense to us.

Your next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.

Q - Michael Lavery{BIO 20141239 <GO>}
Good morning. Thank you.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Good morning, Michael.

Q - Michael Lavery{BIO 20141239 <GO>}
I just wanted to come back to IQOS, you mentioned how with your digital capabilities and website, you've got the ability now for adult smokers to receive a notice when IQOS is available in their area. We've seen online chats and things, comments, lots of people outside the current launch markets who have asked how to get them. So this makes a lot of sense. Can you give us a sense of what response you've had so far and if and how much that might steer where you choose to expand in kind of next or in what order.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, it's a bit early Michael, certainly we've announced the areas that we're expanding to certainly across the 4 states and then Northern Virginia and then 3 additional metro markets, which we haven't discussed what they are and so certainly, it's going to be informed by the consumer and informed by where we believe we can get the heavy foot traffic. Just a reminder, we want to launch initially in a densely populated area and then grow from that once you have a foothold, grow from that across states and so certainly we're going to be influenced by the consumer and the insights we have on the consumers, both from them and what we've seen in the existing markets to inform where we go next.

Q - Michael Lavery{BIO 20141239 <GO>}
Okay, that's helpful. And just one more on IQOS, you mentioned that Marlboro Rewards can be redeemed for discounts on the IQOS device, certainly this seems like it could help build momentum and some trial, but certainly could risk a little bit more cannibalization. How do you balance those 2. You certainly have a lot of incremental momentum already in the markets, you've given some color on that. Can you just give us some of the thinking here is simple as getting a bigger push, even if it might mean a little bit of cannibalization or what's the right way to think about some of that strategy?

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Certainly, Michael. We always have incrementality in mind from a total profitability standpoint, but I think when you look at the vision, we know that our conventional cigarette consumers want to move and we want to now proactively look at moving them; certainly incrementality, and you know the various ways we go to market and we assess that for incrementality to see where we can really reach competitive consumers, but we don't want to ignore our consumers either. We know they want to move. And so we want to reach out when they're ready to move and have them stay in our portfolio of products. And so that's the fine balance. But certainly at retail and the way we reach out to consumers, we assess where we can get incrementality to the greatest extent.

Q - Michael Lavery{BIO 20141239 <GO>}
Okay, that's great, thanks so much.

Your next question is from Adam Spielman with Citibank.

Q - Adam Spielman{BIO 1883727 <GO>}
Thank you very much. So 2 questions, first of all on IQOS in Atlanta. I think you said it went to hover in the rightly 1.1 market share in the stores where you distribute it, but I'm interested to know how many stores that is in Atlanta?. Thank you. That's the first question.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yes, Adam, we go to select retail chains because we want to make sure that we get great execution, the right look and high quality because we want to learn when we have that, what does it look like for consumer engagement. We haven't mentioned the specific number of stores in Atlanta, but our goal, even when we expand to the state is have great execution across the state and habit where each consumer regardless of where they live have access to the product to drive awareness and availability and interest. And so we may not be in every store in a certain locale, but we want to make sure that the consumer in any locale has access to the product.

Q - Adam Spielman{BIO 1883727 <GO>}
I mean if I, you if I estimated that about in metro Atlanta IQOS has included all stores around 30 bps of market share. Would that be about right?

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, we haven't done that Adam to go through that as I am hesitant to say, oh, that's exactly the way to go about it. The way we look at it is we take the geography by zip code and then say okay. Based on that, think about how, what are the cigarette offtake and what is IQOS offtake for the total geography and so I'm hesitant to try to estimate or give you assurance on your estimates.

Your next question comes from Robert Rampton with UBS.

Q - Robert Rampton{BIO 20079733 <GO>}
Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. First one is just on pricing, so it's running at record levels. Despite moderate tax increases and I don't also argue that volumes are being more robust and maybe could expect it to tell, end of last year.

Now, how do you think about the trade-off between, I guess, being more competitive on price. It is taking that incremental margin and investing in your efforts to transition to reduced risk, and that's the first question. Thank you.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks for the question. Robert, I would take you back to the overall strategy we have for the category, which is to maximize the profitability of combustibles through time, while balancing appropriate investments back into Marlboro and funding the growth initiatives, as you mentioned and so it is a balance is something that we look at, but I would agree with you, I would say 8% in the first quarter of our price realization was a great result for the quarter.

Q - Robert Rampton{BIO 20079733 <GO>}
Right. And then, sorry, just a quick clarification on Modern Oral, are you saying the category. The next impact category doubled versus 1Q 20 and that your share within that is now roughly 13%, right way to understand you could?

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah So we were saying novel oral, the total category had a share. So the novel oral tobacco of the total oral space was 13%, so the that now. Yeah, that makes sense of the total space.

Q - Robert Rampton{BIO 20079733 <GO>}
Perfect, very clear. Okay and then just a follow-up on more normal specifically on pack-ins that in for example Marlboro. Can you comment on their effectiveness and then how much of that are you doing. I guess the broader question is why not put on pack-ins in every pack of Marlboro.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, it's certainly something that we wanted to test and learn about understand the engagement, understand the most efficient way to engage with consumers that just one avenue. We're looking at digital avenues and ways to engage with consumers that way and so what you're doing with our investments is we're looking at what are the various ways that we can engage with the consumer and meet them when they trying to make those decisions for their conversion and then support them on that conversion journey as they commence it..And so that's just one avenue but certainly we will test and learn there and understand what the engagement successes and the efficiency of getting that consumer to convert.

Q - Robert Rampton{BIO 20079733 <GO>}
Great. That's all right. And if I may sneak in one more. Apologies. Just in terms of IQOS, curious as to what in your mind, drive the pace of the rollout, but right now it looks like it's very tied to those tax break. so I mean I guess, at what point would we expect a big bang in terms of national loan, so, given getting tax breaks the slow process will be more incremental (inaudible).

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Okay. Yeah, the way we think about it is, and it's just important to remind everyone, look PMI has been on this pathway for a long time, they've been talking about it, certainly you guys have been talking about it. We have, it is brand new to the US consumers. So we want to make sure that we're doing it the right way. I would say in a disciplined fashion versus your terminology a big bang and once we feel like we have it right, we have plans in place to continue the expansion, certainly we're going to be influenced by always being able to put our best foot forward now having the IQOS 3 device approved, having the MRTP claim on the 2.4 system gives us a much better indication and much better engagement plan with the consumer, but we are learning along the way, I would say the Charlotte launch was more successful based on the learnings we had enrichment at Atlanta.

And so we're going to continue that disciplined approach, but I don't want you to think that we're on, we're trying to get that these SCTs agreements with the state legislatures to influence how fast or how we think about the launch that will not be an influence and how we proceed with the IQOS launch.

Q - Robert Rampton{BIO 20079733 <GO>}
All right. That's very clear. Thank you for taking my question.

Once again, if you would like to ask a question please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad that star one. Your next question is from Jennifer Maloney with The Wall Street Journal.

Q - Jennifer Maloney{BIO 16169837 <GO>}
Good morning. So, the FDA just published their press release formally announcing that they intend to pursue a nationwide menthol ban, I wonder from your perspective, what impact would this have on cigarette consumption. How many people would quit cigarette, how many would move to reduced risk products, how many would just by switch from say Newport to Marlboro. For example.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, it's a great question. And again you've caught me off guard because I've been having the phone calls. So I haven't had a chance to read it. I think it will depend on what the proposal is, how they think about that proposal through time and how they think about implementing it.

I would remind you that the science and evidence we see and based on the comments that we had provided previously, we don't see the science and evidence that would support that, we don't think prohibition works, is fraught with unintended consequences. But this is exactly the reason why we pursued a portfolio approach that if there are any actions by the regulatory in any specific category that put the consumer in play. We wanted to make sure we had the right product, right brands in each of the categories and have those products and brands in their consideration set as they are faced with different choices.

But we'll certainly be engaged with the FDA and continue to encourage them to focus on the science and evidence.

Q - Jennifer Maloney{BIO 16169837 <GO>}
Do you think that if it were implemented. I know that's a big if. But it would happen overnight, but would it accelerate the decline in US cigarette volumes.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
I think that's a tough hypothetical to answer. We'll have to see how it's implemented, if it's implemented and how they go about it and how the consumer considers that from a standpoint of what are the unintended consequences and access they have to menthol cigarettes outside of the legal system. And then, are they at play for other products to have gain their satisfaction.

Q - Jennifer Maloney{BIO 16169837 <GO>}
Over the past few years, the company has been trying to expand its presence in the menthol category, noting in investor presentations that that menthol represents a growing share of cigarette US cigarette sales. Could you speak to the importance of the menthol category for Altria and for the US cigarette industry?

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, I think when you think about it for Altria, I would remind you that we are under indexed in share in the menthol category. We tend to be over-indexed in non-menthol. And so from a total standpoint of the category, I would really direct you to the comments we provided to the FDA of our concerns of an outright ban on menthol that we provided previously when they've been looking at them.

Q - Jennifer Maloney{BIO 16169837 <GO>}
All right, thanks very much.

Q - Nik Modi{BIO 7351672 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So just wanted to follow up on the menthol question, Billy maybe you could just remind us the process from here. Right. Just in terms of the steps that need to happen just so we can kind of square it and make sure we're thinking about it the right way.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah. We believe it to be a multi-year process, Nik. When you think about the administrative process and again you caught me a bit unaware because I can't read what they have published and how they how they stated it. So we'll certainly be reading that and diagnosing it, but there is a rule-making process that takes place, they have to come out with proposed rule if that's where they're at right now, they have to receive comments, they have to consider all of those comments and then they have to go to a final rule making. And so that's a pretty lengthy process that we will certainly be engaged in with the FDA to share our point of view.

Q - Nik Modi{BIO 7351672 <GO>}
Okay. And now it's kind of my question, but I guess, which is the everything resets, right, because obviously we've gone through this several times in the last 10 years. So I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that the right way that they have to go through the whole process again.

A - Billy Gifford{BIO 15989479 <GO>}
Yeah, I don't know what they announced. So I can't speak to the specifics, but the normal process that they would go through is a proposed rule, there would be comments, then there would be a final rulemaking. And so again, I can't speak to specifics based on not having read what they nowt.
