Presentation
Operator
Good afternoon. My name is Scott, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice-President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.

Scott Gammill{BIO 20823488 <GO>}
Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer.

Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we'll provide non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Tom Fanning.

Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter financial results continue to support our full-year earnings objectives and the economies within our service territories remained strong, including customer growth and economic activity that has outpaced our expectations. Given our financial performance through the third quarter, we expect full-year adjusted earnings per share near the top of our earnings guidance range.

Before turning the call over to Dan for a more detailed look at our financial performance, I'd first like to provide an update on the recent progress at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Importantly, the projected completion timeline and capital cost forecast for both units remain consistent with what we outlined last quarter. Since our last call, the site team has continued to make substantial progress on Unit 3, highlighted by the successful achievement of several major milestones, including submitting the all ITAAC complete letter, receiving the 103(g) finding from the NRC, which signifies that license acceptance criteria for Unit 3 have been met, and successfully completing the safe transfer of all 157 fuel assemblies from Unit 3 spent fuel pool to the reactor core early last week.

Fuel load marked another historic and pivotal milestone towards startup and commercial operations. The focus over the next couple of months turns to final preparations and testing of systems primarily associated with the electric power production side of the plant and achieving the pristine conditions in the nuclear island necessary for start-up activities. The next major milestone for Unit 3 is initial criticalities or the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction which is projected in January. Once this important milestone is achieved, plant operators can begin the prescribed testing sequence which includes a series of power ascensions and reductions, various sustained power output plateaus, and multiple forced trips to test the unit's safety systems.

This rigorous process is intended to demonstrate the performance of the unit under a variety of conditions and its readiness to be included in reliable dispatch and to be placed in service for the benefit of customers. We continue to project Unit 3 will be placed in service by the end of the first quarter 2023.

Turning to Unit 4, open vessel testing was completed in August and direct construction is now approximately 97% complete. Electrical production in particular electrical terminations remains a key area of focus. To support our projected December 2023 in-service date, recent electrical production levels must be sustained for several more weeks. Testing is expected to become the critical path as the project team progresses towards future milestones of cold hydro testing and the start of hot functional testing which is projected by the end of the first quarter 2023.

Dan, I will now turn the call over to you.

Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share, $0.08 higher than the third quarter of 2021. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher revenues associated with increased usage and retail pricing at regulated utilities. These revenue effects were partially offset by higher non-fuel O&M expenses consistent with the rising cost environment and our long-term commitments to reliability and resiliency, along with higher interest and share dilution from the mandatory conversion of our equity units. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2021 is included in today's release and earnings package.

Turning now to retail electricity sales in the economy, in the third quarter 2022, weather normal retail sales were 1.8% higher than in the third quarter of 2021. This increase reflects stronger sales across all three customer classes as we've continued to see expansion across our Southeast electric service territories. We also continued to see robust customer growth with the addition of 11,000 residential electric customers and 8,000 residential gas customers during the quarter.

We were encouraged by these trends and continue to monitor the potential impacts of supply-chain constraints, labor force participation and inflation pressure on our outlook. The economic development pipeline in our service territories remains robust. Within our electric service territories, economic development announcements through the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 reflect a 170% increase in job additions and a 237% increase in business investment.

Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2022, with adjusted earnings per share through September of $3.35. We expect to achieve adjusted full-year earnings near the top end of our guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share. Our adjusted earnings estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.23 per share.

Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you.

Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Thanks, Dan. We remain encouraged by the sustained level of economic development activity within our service territories as we continue a long legacy of partnering with each of our states to attract new business. In recognition of these efforts, Alabama Power and Georgia Power, we're once again named to Site Selection Magazine's top 20 utilities in economic development out of approximately 3,330 utilities across the United States based on capital investment and job creation activity. We are honored by this recognition and look forward to continuing our commitment to helping our states and communities attract and grow businesses to further strengthen the economies within our service territories for years to come.

In closing, I would like to take a moment to highlight a significant safety milestone at the Vogtle project achieved this month when the site successfully completed its 68 million job hour lost, I mean mean without a lost-time incident. That's 68 million job hour without a lost-time incident.

At Southern Company, safety represents a key tenant of our uncompromising values and this milestone is a testament to the project teams focused on creating a safety-first culture. I'd like to recognize Shawn McGarvey from the North American building trades and Lonnie Stephens from the IBEW along with all of the thousands of individuals that they represent for their tremendous ongoing support at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. These groups have been terrific business partners for us and the recent achievement of several major milestones is a tribute to the dedication of thousands of men and women committed to bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable carbon-free resource for the next 60 to 80 years.

Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) We have a question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Hey, Shar.

Q - Shar Pourreza
Hey, guys. Tom, I think you just got the fastest reward for the quickest prepared remarks so that was good.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
(Technical Difficulty) made Vice-President, give them all the credit.

Q - Shar Pourreza
There you go. Just quickly on Georgia GRC. I guess how are discussions going with interveners? I mean so the staff recommending both the 9.45 ROE as well as a reduction in the equity layer when Vogtle is fully in-service seems somewhat counter to what we're seeing with capital market conditions and kind of the risks that are out there. I guess, what are your thoughts around a settlement and narrowing that bid ask or do you think this case will likely go the litigated route?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Well, Shar, you do know that this is an accounting order, it's what it's been since 1995, which means it's not technically kind of a litigated kind of thing. You know that this process has been in place since 1995 and that it really is I think a process that has been proven tried and true to let every party have their say and have a constructive outcome. And I think we've proven that time and time again. You know us commenting on any particular part of anybody's testimony at this point really isn't constructive. Let the process run and I'm sure we'll be treated in a constructive way at the end of it.

Q - Shar Pourreza
Got it. Perfect. Thanks. And then just on Vogtle, where do things now stand with the other co-owners in terms of resolving any sort of outstanding cost cap or contribution concerns? And I guess what that ultimately means for your ownership of the projects and so on?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
I'll turn this over to Dan here in just -- for more details. But effectively among between Oglethorpe and Dalton and MEAG, we have reached an agreement, a settlement with MEAG. My sense is, Dan, you're not going to know anything else about the rest of these likely until the end of next year.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yes, that's right. And so the settlement with MEAG, I mean, you might see in the materials a slight cost revision for Georgia Powers ownership and that's really reflective of that settlement. Our assumptions previously assumed as many of you know this notion of a tender or put of ownership from any of the co-owners and since that was not part of the resolution, we reached the kind of our estimate of the impact of the settlement is less than our previous estimate.

Q - Shar Pourreza
Got it. Thanks for that. And then just lastly I know you guys have previously have talked about Georgia Power just not really being super competitive against third-party developers in terms of winning the solar RFPs, sort of with the tax credit changes, with transferability, solar PTCs et cetera, that came with the IRA, could Georgia Power, now potentially be able to compete and win a portion of the solar RFPs we're looking that Georgia is going to be running. And then how do we sort of think about that versus what you assume in the current guide? Thanks.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
I am afraid that your question is exactly right. Any differences we had were related to tax treatments, flow-through versus some sort of normalized treatment on the part of Georgia Power. It's interesting, I think during one of the early rounds in other years, we had developers take positions and then Southern Power actually came in and took them out of those positions. So we could compete another way. My sense is the IRA is really going to be helpful to all regulated utilities that otherwise you normalized accounting and it does put us much closer on a equal footing to those folks.

The other thing that we always have to take into account, particularly with renewables that have distributed sites across our service territory is that you know Southern is reasonably well-known for thinking about our expansion plan on a portfolio basis, of course, each company reaches its own conclusion within that portfolio. But those kinds of considerations have to be met and especially when you consider wrapping into that the closure of certain coal plants over time. So, we'll see how it goes but I think overall the IRA is really helpful. Dan, you want to add?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yes. So Shar, it's important to think about this in terms of the planning horizon, right? So this is a longer-term dynamic so, you're not going to see very much on the front-end of the five-year plan. Those decisions have already been made, those RFPs have already been executed for resources. So, really talking about the back half or even the last couple of years of our five-year forecast where this opportunity may manifest itself as potentially rate based assets.

The other thing that is a new dynamic that's entering into the equation the certainly affordability and kind of low-cost profile is what this tax benefits change. Other considerations will begin to factor in to some of these resources to see location, how much the controllability of them and so, it's kind of the difference between the notion of lease cost verses best costs where there is locational dynamics and other things at play.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
And every bit of the IRA to us just serves to reduce the transition cost of our current position to a net 0 future, all for the benefit of our customers. We don't make money off tax benefits, we typically flow them through for the benefit of customers.

Q - Shar Pourreza
Got it. Terrific, guys. Thanks so much and we'll see you in a couple of weeks. Appreciate it.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
You bet. Look forward to it.

Operator
Our next question is from Ross Fowler with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Hey, Ross. How are you?

Q - Ross Fowler{BIO 16864050 <GO>}
Hey, Tom.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Good. How are you? So just a couple of questions. One, election is two weeks away but we're not going to have a Georgia Commission election on that day. So, can you just remind us what the process is from here around redistricting and how does that actually works, whether it's a statewide or district election and how that would sort of proceed? Haven't figured it out yet. This is work ahead for the legislature to undertake. Most likely through next year. Our sense is this is not going to be something that's going to reach a conclusion anytime quickly. There's going to be a lot of debate and a lot of thoughtful consideration about how to put this into play, so really can't guess on it right now and I really don't have an estimate on any timeframe. My sense is it's going to take some time. I don't think we're going to get a result anytime soon.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
And some of that time may be because it becomes a bit of an iterative process between the legislature and the court.

Q - Ross Fowler{BIO 16864050 <GO>}
Thanks, Dan. And then, so the current commission would sit until that process was completed, is that a correct understanding?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
That's right.

Q - Ross Fowler{BIO 16864050 <GO>}
Okay. And then just maybe remind us as we're -- and congratulations on the fuel load, that's a big step. As we get to putting Unit 3 and Unit 4 into service, how did the ROE penalties roll off over time and soon enough if needed for is done on December 2030, then they're all -- there are no more penalties in 2024, if I'm thinking about it correctly.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Sure, Ross. So, again, as a reminder, all of our outlook assumes a total cost for Vogtle that goes in the rates of $7.3 billion. And so the way that will break down in terms of rolling into base rates and thus earning Georgia Powers full allowed ROE, there is $2.1 billion that will go into rate base the month after Unit 3 goes into service. And then the remainder following prudent proceeding next year would go into rates the month after Unit 4 goes in the service. And so based on the current schedule, you'd be at Georgia Powers full allowed ROE on $7.3 billion for the full year 2024.

Q - Ross Fowler{BIO 16864050 <GO>}
And Dan, the penalties now pretty much put you at the cost of debt, right, with the timing of how it's worked, right?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
The passage of time and the increase in the cost of debt, we're essentially there.

Q - Ross Fowler{BIO 16864050 <GO>}
Okay. And then the prudency process you've mentioned, that starts on fuel load at Unit 4?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Correct, fuel load.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Summer of '23.

Q - Ross Fowler{BIO 16864050 <GO>}
Of '23 in the current schedules. Alright. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Dan. Congratulations on fuel load.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Always good having you.

Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Hey, Jeremy. How are you?

Q - Jeremy Tonet{BIO 15946844 <GO>}
Good, good. Good afternoon. Thanks for having me. You touched a bit on it before but as it relates to IRA, just wondering are there any other aspects to the bill that impacts Southern that you could share with us at this point that you've determined? Clearly, benefits for the customer is very important here where other types of tax credits beyond renewables, would that impact Southern or minimum tax? Just wondering if you could share thoughts on the bill more broadly and its impact on Southern.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
The minimum tax thing really ended up not making much of a difference, particularly with the latest change they made. That doesn't impact us hardly at all. This sounds like a policy response but look, longer-term helping with 45Q and research and development and hydrogen, those are all good things that help us get from say, we've already hit our 50% reduction goal, we put it in place in 2030, we hit it a decade early in 2020. Getting from 50% to 80%, we think we know how to do that too. Getting from 80% to a 100% is where these things that relate to innovation and research and development will be helpful.

Obviously, those expenditures will happen before they are put into place. In particular, some of the things that we're interested in are this trade you make in the 30s and 40s between nuclear and combined-cycle with carbon capture and sequestration and certainly, in respect of the cost of adding more renewables, it's something we're focused on. All of those provisions as they are addressed in the bill are helpful.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yes. And Jeremy, I'd say the other things that we're kind of exploring and then trying to better understand and certainly waiting for IRS guidance is the normalization opt-out for storage, that's something we're certainly evaluating how that impacts customer rates. The transfer ability of these tax credits is particularly interesting, especially within Southern Power where historically we might have used tax equity, this creates a new perhaps better dynamic in that regard. There's been a lot of discussion about the nuclear PTC but right now as we sit here based on our interpretation, don't see that having any meaningful impact for us but again, we'll wait for guidance on that and see how that turns out.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yes. And in general, what we really like about the idea of this bill is the structure that the credits are effectively technology neutral and therefore let the market work to show what is best in place for our customers over time.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yeah. And the -- certainly that these are there for the next 10 years...

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yes.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Provides a lot of flexibility and planning and the way we think about it.

Q - Jeremy Tonet{BIO 15946844 <GO>}
Got it. That's all. Very helpful. I just wanted to pickup with the part that you talked about nuclear there and saw during the quarter there is a key milestone with Southern Company and TerraPower as it relates to their molten chloride fast reactor. And I was just wondering if you could provide us your thoughts as far as when you think that type of technology could come into play for utility-scale proven up, what type of timeframe there? And having the ability to ramp up it up-and-down quickly there I guess the benefits that could provide as part of the generation of stack.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yes. I would argue that the new nuclear future of America will likely start with SMRs. We hear a lot about people discussing, putting small motlen reactors into effect. I mean that could happen last half of this decade certainly. The larger Gen IV reactors that you're referencing to me are kind of mid-30s and beyond.

Q - Jeremy Tonet{BIO 15946844 <GO>}
Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Thank you.

Operator
We have a question from David Arcaro our with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - David Arcaro{BIO 20757284 <GO>}
Hey. Thanks so much for the time. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color around just the updates on Unit 4, the timeframe didn't shift. Just wondering for additional color around how productivity has been relative to recent targets based on just eyeballing the green line and the red line, looks like maybe even a little bit ahead over the last two months. And has there been increasing clarity with the progress that you've made on Unit 3 also as you look to Unit 4?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Well, Dan, you and I should tag team this one as well. I'll start. The -- we're gratified with the progress on electrical terminations. We've always called that one out as a risk factor and so long as we sustain our recent performance on the site through say November then we're on track on that issue. So, we're watching it very closely. We're gratified with the progress we've made we just need to continue that progress.

Obviously, as you've seen with Unit 3, our performance on these tests are particularly important. We believe that we've learned a lot from the tests on Unit 3. And where we had some delays due to equipment issues or system issues, we think we've learned a lot and we don't expect to repeat some of the issues that we saw on Unit 3 and Unit 4, so our schedule reflects that as well. Dan?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Look, I think you hit the big issues, testing will become critical path here for Unit 4 in the near term and it is certainly predicated on those lessons learned and being a smooth process. And right now the focus is getting the right people focus on Unit 4 in that regard where they've been tied up on Unit 3 completing that work.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
And all these discussions that Dan and I are referencing occur in a completely open and transparent environment. We have our co-owners with us, we have represented some DOE, NRC, the public commission staff, et cetera. I mean everybody gets to hear all this information in the same way. And I just think we're gratified with the progress we've made. We see our way through to remaining comfortable with the time frames we're laying out.

Q - David Arcaro{BIO 20757284 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then separate topic. I was just wondering if you could touch on how you're managing interest rate headwinds right now with debt issuances coming next year. Any ways to hedge against that proactively or other ways that you're looking to manage potential EPS headwinds there?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Well, I will say this, old dog doesn't learn new tricks, maybe that's not the right line here. But I'm an old finance guy and I really like this stuff. I like liability management. And I can remember back when, Drew Evans was CFO and we were in this low-interest rate environment. We were very intentional about reducing what I call our level of risk capital, that's short-term debt, debt due within one-year, putable debt all that sort of thing. So, we shortened our risk capital, we lengthened the duration of our assets, and I would argue we do this plot. I think it's in your package but Southern Company debt portfolio, when you look at kind of total enterprise value of a corporation is a really valuable asset, it's 18 years long on the average and has a really cheap coupon rate 3.5 or whatever. These guys have done a really nice job managing it. Dan?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yeah. So, Tom's point, we're starting from a great place in that regard. We've done things this year to take risk off the table accelerating or upsizing some of our issuances, taking some of the variability out of the portfolio here in the short term. We'll continue to do those things. And then, look, already in 2022 interest rates certainly are having an impact on our results and we've been able to offset that. We've got levers within the business to do that and we'll continue to focus on those as we move forward. Like with anyone, I mean we were fairly conservative about our assumptions over the long-term and like everyone, I'm sure our assumptions in the short-term we're pretty far off but we're managing through that.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
It's just another issue that we deal with.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
That's right.

Q - David Arcaro{BIO 20757284 <GO>}
Yeah. Great. No, that's helpful. Thanks so much.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Thanks.

We have a question from Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Hey, Nick. Hope you're doing great.

Q - Nick Campanella{BIO 20250003 <GO>}
I am. Thank you and hope everyone else is doing good as well. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess just to like follow up on the interest rate kind of commentary and I'm really just kind of thinking about through next year and the drivers of 2023. Not to get ahead of it but could you just give us any kind of comments on how you're thinking about the growth rate into 2023? I know you've had this for 15 marker out there for 2024 and I think on previous calls you kind of talked about bridging the gap to that $4.15. But you have the ROE penalty, maybe some potential higher financing costs, your sales commentary seems pretty strong and you also have new rates at Georgia Power, so just any other considerations to be thinking of?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yes. And not to pick at your question but all we've ever said about 2024 is $4 to $4.30. I think you were just picking the midpoint. Our range has always been $4 to $4.30, we put that in place some years ago. Dan?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
And Nick, we're not going to change course here, we always provide our annual guidance on our fourth quarter call, so we'll do that again here in February and put our 2023 number out there for the first time. And what we are also likely to do in February is we will narrow that $4 to $4.30 based on what we see at the time. One of the important factors of -- and real uncertainties that existed 30 years ago when we put that in place was knowing we'd have another Georgia Power rate case and then of course everything else transpired in those 30 years. So, once we get past that we will be positioned to narrow that down.

Q - Nick Campanella{BIO 20250003 <GO>}
That's helpful. And yes, I was just picking the midpoint but understood $4 to $4.30. I guess just on the sales growth, your kind of commentary on the economy and your current footprint was notable and just we've seen some of your peers starting to revise longer-term sales load higher, just how are you kind of thinking about that as we prepare for more of a longer-term update in the fourth quarter call?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yes. I don't know whether you saw my thing on CNBC this morning on Squawk Box but it is a consistent refrain and we're actually surprised a wee bit. Our growth so far has been much higher than what we thought and it's pretty comprehensive. A summary though is kind of notable. I was looking for all of our material. We are essentially back to pre-COVID levels on commercial and industrial sales. Our residential sales number is a little over 5% improved. I think that's probably a reflection of a number of things but including kind of workforce Americas reaction to this new hybrid work environment we're finding. The other thing Dan mentioned is the economic development data which continues to be strong. We don't see much of a reduction, a slowing in those numbers. I have a background with the Fed and so I always get into the nerdy economic details but one of the things that our Head Economist here Kenneth Shiver does is look at particular industrial segment. So, we take our top 10 industrial segments which represent I think about 80% of our sales for the industrial segment. And we do look at not only kind of period-over-period results which still show really positive growth, everything looking pretty good, we go to the trouble of go into the first derivative and I would call that a momentum statistic. That would show that even though we still show really good growth that the amount of growth is moderating, and we just need to think about that as we look going forward.

I know a lot of my peers around the country and the economists and the fed and all the pandits are talking about potentially a mild recession sometime first, second, third quarters of 2023. We see no data for the Southeast that indicate that would be here. So, when you hear recession data, just know that generally speaking it is national broad-brush kind of statistic. The Southeast region is it appears to be by the data we have much more resilience and much less prone to such a downturn.

We have a question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith{BIO 15955666 <GO>}
Hey.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Hey, Julien. Great to (Technical Difficulty)

Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith{BIO 15955666 <GO>}
Hey. Thanks for taking the time. I appreciate it. Good to see up late and pleasure to chat. Hey, listen, Tom, I wanted to ask you a question specifically, I mean we saw some headlines in the quarter here about perhaps your eventual retirement here. Can you talk a little bit about succession planning and just where we stand in that process? And Tom specifically how long are you thinking about staying vis-a-vis in service of the units here? Just to prep the Street around your thought process.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yes. There's been a lot written about that, I'm feeling like Methuselah for heaven's sake. Look, I am 65.5 so that's a fact, somebody saw fit to write an article about that. The fact is Southern Company's Board has made no assessment of that one way or the other. There is no timetable for me leaving. I certainly have an interest in progressing the Vogtle Units that's for sure. You should know also one of my comments to that repoter I think got misconstrued or I don't know. He asked me are you looking for a successor and I said, look it's every CEO's job. First day, they get there to have a succession plan in place. That got turned into I'm actively looking for a successor. Here's the truth of it, and you all know this I think.

When you look at our brothers and sisters around the United States, Southern Company has been a terrific place to grow talent. We have several subsidiaries where we can give people experiential opportunities beyond just growing within a silo of functions within their experience at the company. And it is our intention to do that. Somebody is successful in a certain area, we put them into a place where maybe they don't know as much, maybe they're not as comfortable and they got to build new constituents in order to succeed. We have a very rigorous process. We have had a rigorous process for 20, 25 years of growing talent and moving them around.

The latest example, Robin Boren, who has been Treasurer at Southern Company is now I guess, effective November 1st is going to become CEO of Southern Power. This is just another example of how we move people around that show us that they have the capability to grow into senior positions inside the company. So, we'll continue with that. The great news is that there's good talent all over this industry, there is exceptional talent inside Southern, and I'm very very happy with the bench, the Southern Company Management Council and beyond.

Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith{BIO 15955666 <GO>}
Excellent. Thank you for providing that and clearing the air as you say on some of the articles out there. If I can just a follow up on next last question a little bit. You all have a track record, especially through COVID of finding offsets and reductions and just dealing with difficult context, to the extent to which that we're dealing with inflation today whether that manifest itself in the form of liability management, in interest expense or just generally elevated labor costs at Vogtle and elsewhere. How are you thinking about providing a comprehensive update on that front as well? I know that you talked about narrowing 24 year but can you talk a little bit more specifically about your efforts to manage inflation and offset on that front as well?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
As with just about anything, Julien, it's all of the above approach, right? So -- and it always has been for us. So, we have managed both in the short-term and more importantly in the long-term around all these kind of issues and we'll continue to do that. So, to a degree that we will be changing the way we operate becoming more efficient, it will be looking for ways to deploy capital that thus reduce O&M. It will be looking for ways to grow the business more to help offset what might otherwise be headwinds elsewhere. And then importantly along the way while we're focused on all of that, we'll also, as we always are, be focused on clean, safe, reliable and importantly affordable energy as we navigate this with our regulators and strike the right balance there.

Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith{BIO 15955666 <GO>}
Got it. All right. Fair enough. It will be embedded whenever you guys update on '24 at the end of the day. I'll take it.

We have a question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Michael Lapides{BIO 6317499 <GO>}
Hi.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Hey, Michael.

Q - Michael Lapides{BIO 6317499 <GO>}
Hey, Tom, thank you and Dan, for taking my questions. First one, number of your peers have built-up pretty sizable deferred fuel balances, that may take a couple of years to recover just given the spike in power and gas prices. Just curious whether you're seeing the same thing across your larger subsidiaries. And in your conversations with stakeholders how you're thinking about the timeline to recover those differed fuel balances?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yes. Michael, this is Dan. So, we are certainly having discussions with our regulators. We've been very transparent and proactive about making sure that they understand and appreciate this macro dynamic that has occurred particularly with natural gas cost and to an extent coal prices as well. And so yes, we like -- you mentioned Michael like many peers have accumulated a pretty sizable unrecovered balance as of the end of the third quarter in total it's about $2.2 billion. Vast majority of that is the Georgia Power which is about $1.7 billion. So, with each of our jurisdictions, the process is little different. Some are a little more regular in their cadence, some are little more discretionary. I think the plan for that largest balance in Georgia be addressed early next year. And again, we'll work very closely with the regulators to make sure that's done in a way that is the least impactful for customers as possible.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
And Michael, I could just add as a comment on dogma. As apart from the so-called organized markets, the integrated regulated markets provide us a mechanism to pass-through fuel clause -- fuel costs. So, there was no profit incentive for us, in other words, it's always incentive for us to keep prices as low as possible. And so we have done that. We've had programs in place that have helped us keep those cost low. This year, we've hedged 34% of our fuel prices, gas prices at about $3.23, next year 32% at $4.73. Certainly, those are below the spot prices for natural gas right now. Nobody can predict the future but certainly, those kinds of programs which have been put in place with the conjunction of the public service Commission have been awfully helpful to reduce the pressure on that issue.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yes.

Q - Michael Lapides{BIO 6317499 <GO>}
Got it.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
One last...

Q - Michael Lapides{BIO 6317499 <GO>}
Go ahead.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
So just an addition to continuous proactive dialog regulators. We've been having similar conversations with the rating agencies making sure that they are keenly aware of us likely having to carry a little incremental debt to see this through but all of our subsidiaries, Georgia Power, in particular, Alabama Power, Mississippi Power have the financial strength to be able to weather that.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
One last comment I just want to do it but on a going forward basis, once Vogtle 3 and 4 go and service, the equivalent energy price coming out of that plant is going to be effectively about a $1 per million but, it's going to be awfully attractive assets that will run 24/7 365.

Q - Michael Lapides{BIO 6317499 <GO>}
Got it. And then a follow-up question, a little bit unrelated. I mean, Vogtle CapEx should step down materially next year and then done in 2024 except for maintenance. And there's -- Dan, you made the comment of if there's new-generation additions coming in the capital plan, it's kind of in the back end of the plan. How are you thinking about the potential for incremental capital allocation not necessarily in 2023 you're still spending on Vogtle but kind of in '24, '25 timeframe?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yes. Look, it's not unchanged from where we were earlier this year. I mean our capital plan is designed to support our growth rate of 5% to 7%. I think we highlighted in the fourth quarter call kind of the history of our planning process and how opportunities emerge further out in the forecast you get as we roll the forecast forward. The numbers continue to increase as we get clarity on things as we bet things with regulators, as new regulations emerge, as new technologies emerge and I think that will continue to happen. And then we've got an allocation that we set aside for Southern Power that's been a little quiet here in recent days because of the uncertainty that existed before IRA pass. I think you'll see that continue to ramp-up. Look, we've got a plan today, Michael, that doesn't require us to issue any equity to finance it and to the extent, we find more opportunities that are able to earn either a regulated returns or the returns that we require of the projects in Southern Power we will adjust our financing plan. But I'm happy to turn our equity plans on the finance more regulated growth.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yes. And Dan please correct me if I misstate this but I think you guys have done, you and your team have done a great job illustrating to the investment community how we develop a CapEx estimate. And I'm being more direct than you were. The outer years are always underestimated. When you go through time, we end up spending more money than we estimate in the outer years. And if I had to estimate that in the current five-year plan, aren't we estimating something like $41 billion over five years and if we kind of adjusted for what may happen, more reasonable number may be as much as $45 billion?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yeah. I don't think that's unfair. And importantly the $41 billion, the starting point is what supports our 5% to 7% growth rate. And so as more opportunities to invest are identified, it's simply increases the durability of that growth rate either in the short-term or over the long-term.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
And you should know, all of you on the phone should know that some companies put a bunch of plug estimates in there, we don't. We do sensitivities to indicate what may happen with higher CapEx assuming we get appropriate recovery which we think we would. But that's the way we are. We have a conservative plan.

Q - Michael Lapides{BIO 6317499 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.

Hey, Tom. Thanks for giving me the chance. Hey, just one -- I have one housekeeping question and then just a follow-up. In terms of the -- and forgive me if I missed this and I think you discussed this as part of the last Q&A but the 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth target, is that still sort of where are projecting long-term earnings growth?

Q - Durgesh Chopra{BIO 20053859 <GO>}
Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just can you comment on there were some discussion of it, just bill increases, what should we expect here in the near-term given the fuel price increases? What are we looking at over the next few months in terms of customer bill increases and how could you potentially offset some of that?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yeah. Hey, Durgesh. We have a policy, you follow us for some time have never front-running a regulatory process. We're not going to start now. So that's going to be a question I'll let alone for now. When we see results then we'll be able to speak to this specifically.

We have a question from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Angie, how are you?

Q - Angie Storozynski{BIO 15115714 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just a couple of questions about the Vogtle 4. So, is there an agreement between the co-owners are still the in-service date and how the companies are showing it, I almost feel like, I think I'm referring here to Oglethorpe, it seems like they're showing first quarter '24 as the COD for Vogtle 4, and I'm just wondering if this is basically what the whisper date is it that it's up to them to actually make a call on the start of commercial operations?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yes. Angie, it's a wonderful question. Look, our performance to date indicates that we are in the reasonable expectation of achieving a year-end '23 in-service date. You'll have to ask Oglethorpe why they may depart from that.

Q - Angie Storozynski{BIO 15115714 <GO>}
Okay. And then secondly just tracking the ITAACs for that unit and I remember that they were very lumpy with Unit 3. So, it's -- again, I mean it seems like you need very many of them to start fuel load. So, again, is there any pattern in those ITAACs that we should be worried about? Ar again they are just as lumpy as they were with Unit 3?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yes. There's about 240 or little above that remaining on Unit 4, Angie. And yes, there's not a normal cadence if you will and there's also a lot of things that are tied to particular milestone tests. So, hot functional testing as, an example, there'll be a lot to either comment as a result of that or after that, and that's where we really started focusing on them for Unit 3 and kind of laying out the remaining schedule. But I would not expect any sort of linear progression there it will be lumpy.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
We'll in fact, Angie, your memory is absolutely spot-on, it is lumpy. And the reason it's lumpy is when we finished systems then we are able to submit the ITAACs. And we call it a problem we had, I guess it was earlier this year right around the end of the year into January finishing up all of the paper. We think we've put in place controls, processes which will speak to that, we should not repeat that problem. So, as we finish system completions associated with the big milestone, right, so ultimately hot functional test you'll see a big ramp-up, a lumpy look and ramp up of some middle of ITAAC.

Q - Angie Storozynski{BIO 15115714 <GO>}
Great. And just one follow-up. And I appreciate that you have limited visibility as to the the way the election is going to be run for the GRC, for the commission. Now, when I think about the prudence review and the elections that may happen in between now and then, how many of the commissioners will have been replaced? Again, I know that it depends on the election that has actually happened but just theoretically.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
I couldn't even hazard a guess at that. It really depends on when they come up, when the legislature comes up with this process. I have no idea when that will be or what the outcome will be and therefore it's hard to answer your question. I am sorry but.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yes. Based on the current terms, Angie, there are only two...

Q - Angie Storozynski{BIO 15115714 <GO>}
Yes.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Upfront this year and there were none scheduled for next year. And so, just again if it gets resolved quickly, it will be the two that would participate in a special election. There is another commissioner of re-election in 2024.

Q - Angie Storozynski{BIO 15115714 <GO>}
Very good. Okay. That's all I need. Thank you.

Hello, Paul.

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
Hey, how's it going? Congratulations on a good quarter.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Thank you. Appreciate it.

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
Can you update us on the construction work construction work that's left on Unit 3. I think you had indicated that you were doing construction after you got the 103(g) letter up until fuel load. Is all of that construction completed or how many hours of construction are remaining there?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Tiny amount. And I would almost refer to it as construction at this point. It's really finishing, the finest tuning as you can imagine in order to go critical. For example, we've loaded the fuel, we have to put the top on the reactor vessel and ratchet down the enormous bold structures that will tighten that top down. We have to finish what they call coding. So, this would be areas like walls, they just need to be paying it. They weren't required on a safety-related basis. It is finally -- so when the reactor vessel in order for us to load fuel, it had to be pristine cleanliness and actually putting the top on the reactor vessel preserves that condition. We want to finish all of the minute cleaning procedures that will be necessary for us to run that plant, it's stuff like that.

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
And is this -- I mean is it days, weeks, months?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Well, what I would say, Paul is the next milestone, we're guiding you to is...

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
Criticalities.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
It's criticality and that's January.

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
So you would finish then the construction between now and then or whatever additional work there is between now and January?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yes, sir. I'm not sure I would call that construction but yes, that's right.

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
And then can you discuss the secondary steam systems in the plant? Do we need to wait until after criticality when you go through that testing phase to make sure that that system is working the way that you wanted to work or can you address that earlier?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
So, here's the thing, there is a prescribed process and it's a great graph but nobody let me put it out there. But it's a really interesting-looking graph that shows a prescribed process of taking the plant up in power and then taking it down. For example, within I think the first week or so, 10 days will get to 25% power then they take it down, and then we'll go to 50% and take it down, and then we'll go to 75% and take it down, and then 90% and then a 100%. They do all sorts of trips and bells and whistles along the way and what they're trying to do is what may be a condition that could exist once the plant goes in-service to make sure that everything works as it is supposed to. If you want more details on that, we filed the VCM here recently and there's a good bit of background in that VCM report that we filed that can give you more here if you want to see it.

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
Great. And then last question from me. I'll take a shot at what somebody asked as an earlier question. But do you -- would you expect to settle the general rate case or do you think the parties are too far apart?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
No, it's not -- whether we settle or not has no bearing on too far apart or at least it hasn't in the years past. You know Paul, just go -- I mean you followed us forever it seems like and we have had this process in place into '95 and every three years we go through this and typically we reach an agreement just before the holidays. I would expect that to occur again. There's a lot of value, it's almost therapeutic if you will to let everybody's views come out in the open and have a good fair debate. We've been treated fairly every other time, my sense is we'll be treated fairly again.

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}

And we have a question from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Travis Miller{BIO 15260606 <GO>}
Hello. Thanks for taking my question. The customer growth to the extent that that continues above the forecast, what does that mean for mix of CapEx spending in terms of distribution versus potentially even transmission but certainly distribution versus generation? Where does that stand?

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
If I remember correctly, Dan, again correct me if I'm wrong, in the old days we spent about $1 billion a year on T&D kind of every year. I would argue that maybe amped up a little in recent years because of what I would call hardening or resilience expenditures. You remember hurricane, Yuri Hurricane, two is Winter Storm Uri that went through Texas. One of the things we did in a proactive way was to look at our kind of planning margin system average temperature and we reduced that temperature to give us more margin on extreme weather. Those are the kinds of things that we are spending more money on T&D for I would argue.

As well there is some T&D expenditures that will be intertwined with ultimately our generation location decisions. And I think we've been over this a lot with you guys but if you look at North Georgia, what's the final disposition and when of Plant Bowen? Whether we locate more generation in the North or let more generation be located in the South and add the transmission necessary to get that generation to the load center, those are the kind of decisions that will cover in the next I don't know, three to five years.

Q - Travis Miller{BIO 15260606 <GO>}
Okay. That's helpful. And then real quick back on the capital allocation. I know you can't talk about what the Board is going to do but what are general thoughts on the dividend to the extent that you get to that post Vogtle $4 to $4.30 obviously that suggests a significant jump. Play your thoughts on that side.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yes, Travis, so this is Dan. So, we've talked about this in an earlier call. There is -- if you look at our slide deck, Slide 21 kind of represents the uplift from the completion of Vogtle from a cash flow perspective. We're really thinking about that uplift supporting three things, one is an improvement in our overall financial profile, particularly our credit profile. Thing two is it continues to fund our growth, and then, thing three is the dividend. We have increased the dividend every year for over two decades now, going back 75 years we've never cut the dividend, it's an incredibly important part of our overall value proposition. As we get to 2024, given the improvement in our profile and given a durable growth rate, we think the Board will certainly have the opportunity to reevaluate the pace of growth and perhaps better align the growth in the dividend with growth in earnings.

Q - Travis Miller{BIO 15260606 <GO>}
Okay. That's great. Understand. Thanks so much.

A - Thomas A. Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
No, I'm just reminded maybe age is getting to me but I can remember the first time, no, I don't know five, six years ago where somebody was pleading with me to have a boring earnings call. You know the old mantra of regular predictable, sustainable starts to re-enter our dialog now. As we finish these major milestones on Vogtle and we look towards the future. I wouldn't say that this was a boring call at all but it certainly has less volatility in it given the performance that this company has been able to achieve. Here's open for the future. We feel confident, we look forward to finishing the year strong and looking forward to a new year next year.
