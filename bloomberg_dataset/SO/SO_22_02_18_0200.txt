Good afternoon, my name is Chris and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.

Scott Gamill
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company's year-end 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer.

Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information, various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs, and subsequent filings.

In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measures are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom.

Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials that we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share for 2021, exceeding both our original 2021 guidance and the estimate that we provided on our 3rd quarter call. This performance is due in no small part to our outstanding service territories and the unparalleled commitment of our employees to deliver clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy to our customers.

Our outstanding customer service, our commitment to the communities we serve, and our proactive engagement with our stakeholders are reflected in the numerous honors we've highlighted in our slide deck, including recent recognition as a number two in the nation on Forbes 2022 list of America's Best Large Employers.

Many of the initiatives that support this distinction are reflected in our inaugural transformation report, which we released earlier this week. This report detailed our sustained commitment and actions to further advance equity both within our company and our communities. These commitments allow Southern Company to help lead change within our communities and provide an enduring reflection of our values. We are proud of the progress we have made and continue to recognize the opportunity to do more. As an example of the work we're doing to drive our customer satisfaction results, a meaningful portion of our capital plans in recent years has been allocated to the continued modernization of our electric grids.

Our grid automation strategies and investments are delivering real value to customers, and in 2021, our customers experienced 15% fewer minutes of interruption. Similar initiatives will continue to be a major component of our capital plans going forward.

Across all of our stakeholder groups, including employees, customers, communities, and investors, we're focused on sustainability and a long-term view of value, that objective remains sound, the long-term financial plan that we outlined for you last year remains intact. And we are reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate expectation, consistent with adjusted earnings per share in a range of $4 to $4.30 in 2024.

Let's now turn to an update regarding some of the recent developments related to our progress on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. As you can see in the materials provided earlier today, we updated our expected completion timeline for both units, extending the in-service dates for each unit by three to six months.

As we discussed on previous calls, the paper process is a critical aspect of turning plant components and systems over from construction to testing and operation. We have discovered incomplete and missing inspection records concerning much of the materials and equipment that have been installed at unit three. These inspection records are an important part of the documentation that is necessary to file ITAAC.

Our progress on Unit 3 ITAAC has slowed as we address a backlog of tens of thousands of inspection records needing completion to support system turnovers. Through hard work over the last several weeks, we have reduced this backlog by more than 30%. Documentation within these inspection records is a critical aspect of getting it right and the time and resources to complete the remaining inspection records and remediate construction issues identified in the process, including the impact of borrowing Unit 4 resources, are key drivers for the change in schedule.

We have 123 I tax remaining for Unit three. The revised ITAAC completion schedule we've included in our slide deck is consistent with a three-month change in the Unit 3 schedule. Over the past year, a number of challenges, including shortcomings and construction and documentation quality, have continued to emerge, adding to project timelines and cost. In recognition of the possibility for new challenges to emerge, we further risk adjusted our current forecast by establishing a range of 3 to 6 additional months for each unit and we've reserved for the maximum amount.

We continue to make meaningful progress on both units, notably for Unit 3, all 157 fuel assemblies have been loaded into the spent fuel pool in preparation for fuel load. For Unit 4, direct construction is now approximately 92% complete, open vessel testing has started and we recently completed the structural integrity and integrated leak rate tests without issue. The aforementioned challenges on Unit 3 are serving as lessons learned for Unit 4 and had benefited our performance on Unit 4 to date, relative to Unit 3.

First-time quality on both construction and documentation are key areas of focus. Our priority is bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online, and again, to get it right. To provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years.

With this most recent change in project cost and schedule, provisions in the Vogtle 3 and 4 co-owner agreement came to the forefront, requiring the owners to affirmatively vote to proceed with the project.

Vogtle 3 and 4 is incredibly important to the State of Georgia and its robust growing economy. Furthermore, the addition of 2000MW of baseload carbon-free energy is vital to increasing the availability of net-zero energy resources across the state. Considering these facts and our proximity to commercial operation, Georgia Power has already voted to proceed. The other owners are required to vote by March 8th which allows time for them to work through their own governance processes.

Consistent with the schedule extension of up to 6 months additional for each unit, Georgia Power share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $480 million, largely as a function of time, additional resources to complete the remaining work with the necessary focus on quality construction and documentation, and the replenishment of contingency.

We continue working constructively with our co-owners to resolve different interpretations of the cost-sharing agreement with an expected potential range of outcomes of $100 million to $900 million.

We have included $440 million of the $900 million in our total project cost estimate. In aggregate, Georgia Powers resulting total capital cost forecast is $920 million and as a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $686 million during the fourth quarter. We value our partners on Vogtle 3 and 4 and the relationship we've had with them across multiple assets for decades. We look forward to our continued partnership with each new unit as they transition to commercial operation, providing millions of Georgians with clean, safe, reliable, and affordable electricity for decades to come.

Before turning the call over to Dan for an update on our 2021 financial performance and our long-term outlook, I'd like to briefly touch on Georgia Powers triennial integrated resource plan or IRP, which was filed with the Georgia Public Service Commission late last month, the proposed plan sets forth a proactive innovative, and transformational roadmap for how Georgia Power expects to support customers and it's growing service territory for decades to come.

Consistent with Southern Company's path to net-zero carbon emissions, the plan describes a tangible path to transition Georgia Power's generating fleet to cleaner, more economical resources. This plan includes the retirement of all of the coal units Georgia Power controls by 2028, except for plant Bowen Units 3 and 4, which are scheduled to be retired no later than 2035. The plan also includes a request for the addition of 6000 megawatts of renewable generation by 2035, more than doubling Georgia Power's current renewable resources.

Additionally, 1,000MW of storage is requested by 2030 to prove the capacity value of these intermittent resources. In recognition of the changing energy landscape, Georgia Power proposed innovative programs to promote reliability and resilience, including a distributed energy resource programs. The comprehensive long-term plan also addresses continued investment in our transmission system and energy efficiency programs for customers.

The IRP is subject to the review and approval of the Georgia Public Service Commission. Hearings will take place during the first half of 2021 with a final decision due this summer. Dan, I'll turn the call over now to you, please take it away.

Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon everyone. All of our major subsidiaries had a strong 2021, as a result, our full-year adjusted earnings were $3.41 per share, $0.16 higher than adjusted results in 2020 and $0.06 above the top end of our original 2021 guidance range.

Financial performance for the year was highlighted by strong customer growth, improving retail sales trends and continued investment in our state-regulated utilities.

These positive factors were partially offset by milder temperatures throughout 2021, resulting in a negative $0.05 variance for weather, as compared to 2020 and a negative $0.14 variance compared to normal weather.

Additionally, 2021 non-fuel O&M reflected the trend towards more normal operating conditions relative to the significantly reduced levels in 2020. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results, compared to 2020 is included in today's release and earnings package.

Weather-adjusted retail electricity sales were up 2.4% compared to 2020, approximately 1% better than our forecast for 2021, almost all of this positive variance can be accounted for in residential electricity sales as a result of continued robust customer growth and an extension of the increased usage trends which began in 2020.

Residential sales outpaced our expectation for the year by 2.7%, reflecting what we think could represent a transition to sustain hybrid work practices across our service territories.

We continue to analyze retail electricity sales relative to pre-pandemic levels and in aggregate, in the fourth quarter, our weather-normalized retail electric sales exceeded sales in the fourth quarter of 2019. We are encouraged by these trends and we'll continue to monitor the implications of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflation pressures on our outlook.

Our stronger than expected customer growth is a trend that differentiates our service territories. Over the last two years, we've added an average of nearly 55,000 new residential electric customers and 30,000 residential natural gas customers across our regulated utilities. Average residential electric customer additions were 43% higher over the past two years than the average for the five years ended in 2019. Customer growth continues to be driven by a strong labor market recovery and our Southeast territories are on track to reach pre-pandemic levels of employment later this year.

Further supporting these trends, the economic development pipeline within our Southeast service territories remains robust. For example, the average number of job announcements was 22% higher and business investment in Georgia was 39% higher than average for the years leading up to the pandemic.

Macro trends in e-commerce and electric transportation combined with a diverse well-trained workforce and a low cost of living have combined to drive major locations and expansions of distribution centers, data centers, manufacturing facilities and headquarters into our service territories.

Turning now to our expectations for 2022, our adjusted earnings guidance for the year is $3.50 to $3.60 per share. The $3.55 midpoint represents a growth rate of approximately 7.5% from the midpoint of our original 2021 guidance range.

In the first quarter of 2022, we estimate that we will earn $0.90 per share included in our guidance is the more normalized assumption for retail electric sales growth of 0% to 1%, although a continuation of recent trends to deliver upside to that assumption. We continue to see long-term adjusted EPS growth in the range of 5% to 7%, consistent with adjusted earnings in a range of $4 to $4.30 per share in 2024 with 90% of total projected earnings over the five-year planning horizon coming from our state-regulated utilities. Our expected EPS trajectory has a solid foundation. Additionally, our history of constructive regulation strong credit ratings and disciplined O&M spending served to strengthen our outlook.

Underlying our long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% is a robust capital investment plan that continues to be driven by significant investment in our state-regulated businesses, our base capital investment plan of approximately $41 billion, which excludes the capital required to complete Vogtle Units 3 and 4 supports our 2024 estimate for adjusted earnings per share of $4 to $4.30.

This forecast represents a $2 billion increase in state regulated utility investment for the common years 2022 through 2025 from our forecast a year ago. These increases in our forecast are the result of greater visibility into investments to upgrade our enterprise applications, serve major known customer expansions or additions, further improve our grid and protect our technology infrastructure, as well as investments related to the transition of our fleet.

We have long maintained a disciplined approach to capital forecasting within our state regulated utility businesses. We don't use placeholders and we don't include capital that is expected to earn our allowed returns. The result of this approach is that our forecast tends to grow especially in the later years, as our visitability in the customer growth increases as regulatory processes unfold, as compliance obligations evolve and as our long-term system planning is refined.

We fully expect this trend to continue, Including in relation to Georgia Power's IRP. For example, neither the long-term hydro investment plan nor the proposed company-owned energy storage systems are fully reflected in our forecast. Additionally, none of the renewable additions proposed in the IRP are included due to both their timeframes and the potential for selecting purchased resources.

Furthermore, we continue to believe Southern Power has a significant opportunity to continue growing through investments to facilitate fleet transitions and the growth in clean energy infrastructure broadly across the United States.

Southern Power's model has been distinctive since its beginnings in the early 2000s focused on long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties and a risk-adjusted return profile that marries well with our overall value proposition.

While we expect near-term opportunities to meet our criteria to be modest. We do believe opportunities will accelerate in future years, we've allocated out of the $3 billion to Southern Power over the 5-year plan with approximately $250 million in 2022, $500 million in 2023 and $750 million annually for the remainder of the forecast. Again, these allocations of capital are not included in our base capital forecast.

In aggregate, our financial plan is anchored to our base capital forecast of $41 billion and we believe upside potential exists in our state-regulated utility forecasts and our Southern Power allocation, representing spending of over $44 billion as part of our strategy to sustainably drive long-term growth in earnings and dividends.

We also believe many of the same drivers for additional potential investment over the next 5 years could translate to investment opportunities beyond 2026 as we continue on our journey to net zero.

And finally, we've included an updated three-year financing plan in the appendix to our slide deck today. This plan, which is consistent with our updated capital investment plans and the potential capital investment opportunities we've highlighted, continues to assume no equity need over our 5-year plan horizon.

Credit quality and strong investment-grade credit ratings remain a top priority. We expected improvement in our consolidated FFO to debt metrics equates to 200 to 300 basis point increase from 2021 and 2020 levels by 2024. We've included a slide in the appendix to highlight some of the drivers for this expected improvement, combined with the expected reduction and construction risk over the next 12 to 18 months, we believe we are well-positioned to support our credit quality objectives.

Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you.

Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Thanks, Dan. Southern Company strives to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder returns. and I believe the plan that we've laid out supports that objective. Our customer and community-focused business model, our growing investments into our premier state-regulated utility franchises, the priority we place on credit quality, and our commitment and actions towards net-zero, all contribute towards making Southern Company a sustainable premier investment. A remarkable track record for dividends is another major contributor to that equation.

For nearly three quarters of a century, we have paid a quarterly dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter, including dividend increases in each of the past 20 years. As we look ahead, assuming adjusted earnings within our estimated range of $4 to $4.30 per share in 2024, a payout ratio that is expected to be at or below 70% and a sustainable long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%, we believe that once Vogtle 3 and 4 are completed, our Board will have the opportunity to consider an increase in the rate of growth of dividends, further solidifying our long-term value proposition.

Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. At this time. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith{BIO 15955666 <GO>}
(multispeaker) Hey, listen on the incremental cost, I just want to break this down, if you will, I mean, a lot of numbers flying around here. So of the $440 million you talked about in incremental cost, how much of that is driven by the co-owners agreement? Can you break that down right? So you got a 180 from the sharing band and then above that sharing band, what percentage of the cost is borne to you if you will?

So can you kind of break down the sort of the successive price if you will? And then of that, what was the base project cost that was agreed upon co-owners and what was the decision on COVID related cost, right, emphasis on that last piece, if you don't mind?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Julien, this is Dan. So, the $440 you absolutely hit it right within there is a $180 million, that $180 million is consistent with the provisions in our agreements with co-owners where Georgia Power bears a fixed percentage of incremental cost up to a certain point, and so that $180 million is the maximum amount of exposure under those provisions. Above the threshold for those provisions is where this option to tender cost responsibilities to Georgia Power kicks in.

And that number embedded in the $440 million is $260 million. So what that represents is Georgia Power's assumption of bearing $260 million, say it a different way, a 100% of all the dollars above the threshold. So that $260 represents -- their share is already captured in the $480, this is capturing the co-owners piece that is assumed in these numbers to be tendered.

And what was the second part of your question, Julian?

Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith{BIO 15955666 <GO>}
Well, I just COVID related costs. I'm going to follow up more holistic as well.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yeah. So as we have disclosed and we talked about last quarter, there is differing interpretations in this co-owner agreement as to exactly how those provisions work and exactly what the starting point works? So rather than air those specific differences here on the call, let's let those conversations take place in the proper form, but suffice it to say, the two differing points of view is the starting point for where the initial provisions kick in and how COVID cost ultimately adjusts any cost before sharing.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Hey, and Dan, one more point, I think and please, I know you'll correct me if I get this wrong, but we've associated the cost with tender in this estimate. We have not given any credit for the value of megawatts tendered. At the high end of the estimate, the amount of megawatts tendered, if everybody tendered, maybe around 75MW to 80MW. At the level in which we've estimated, we think it could be around 30MW.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
That's correct, Tom.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
And we've given no credit to any value associated with those megawatts. We've talked about this on prior calls, the fact that you may have megawatts that's going to be carbon-free, resilient for decades to come, we think it would have real value. We've reflected no value in any of these estimates.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
And just to put a finer point on this, Julien, we've included this $440 million and that represents an estimate of an outcome. We do not, at this stage, have an agreement with our co-owners. We still have that difference of opinion.

Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith{BIO 15955666 <GO>}
Right, exactly. And maybe can you speak a little bit about this process then, you talk about this March 8th date with the co-owners here. Any initial indications on where they stand? Obviously, this 90% is the high bar, but theoretically, they could vote to proceed and then related to that, they could tender the incremental cost to you, right? I just want to make sure I understand, they're kind of two separate parallel processes here?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yeah. Julien, the way we would think about that is to make them completely separate, okay? Well, the process is simple. By the contract that we entered into, way back when, what was it, 2018, I guess.? And I guess we signed in early '19, but that kind of provision spoke to a potential outcome that was really onerous, like there were some cataclysmic problems and we could all go our ways. Our calculus was pretty simple. We are this close to loading fuel and ultimately getting Unit 3 on service and then ultimately Unit 4. To us, it was an easy decision to proceed.

Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith{BIO 15955666 <GO>}
Yeah. All right, But the processes are separate and from their perspective, they couldn't be able to proceed and then ultimately, allocate that tender, their megawatts to you, as you just talked about a moment ago, right?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
They're completely separate processes.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
So they could decide to proceed. And separately, they can tender.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
That's right. And there is 120 days to 180-day clock that we've disclosed in our 10-K as well that is really the time period to clarify tender or not? And the ultimate calculation, we alluded to megawatts, we alluded to dollars. All of that would not get buttoned up until Unit 4 was in service and all of the costs were known.

Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith{BIO 15955666 <GO>}
All right. Excellent, thank you guys for the clarity. Dan, well stated.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
You bet, Julien.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Thanks, Bud.

Operator
Our next question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Hey, Shar, thanks for joining us.

Q - James Ward{BIO 4776826 <GO>}
Hey, Tom, it's actually James Ward on for Shar, thank you for taking my question. Tom, at a high level, when we think about the IRPs and let's say Georgia Power specifically, as you were mentioning before, I understand that any storage or hydro improvement spend would be incremental. But what about transmission? Is there any IRP-related spend baked into the $41 billion base plan or is anything that comes out of the IRP going to be incremental?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Hey, James. This is Dan. So, yes, there is transmission spend in there. In this forecast period for the five years, it is modest. Keep in mind that the plan includes retiring coal units in the '27-'28 timeframe. And then further again in 2035. So the timeline to construct and frankly plan and permit these transmission projects is going to take the bulk of this forecast period and spending really occurs beyond. The other detail, James, in the way you asked the question, I want to make sure it's clear.

There is some storage reflected in the capital forecast, but not, it's a fraction of what has been assumed as a planning assumption in the IRP. The one project that Georgia Power specifically asking for approval of is in our capital plan.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
And the only other thing I'll add is that.

Q - James Ward{BIO 4776826 <GO>}
Sorry, please go ahead.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
The only other thing I will add, I think I've done this before and kind of in a private conversations with you all, one-on-one, but as you start thinking about retiring Vogel, I mean I'm sorry, Bowen 3 and 4, there creates a need in North Georgia and we've talked about that, further study is required in order to evaluate how you replace that. Is that going to be more solar? Is it going to be a combined cycle, is it going to be importing megawatts from the South of the North, and therefore incremental transmission? We just haven't done all that work yet.

Q - James Ward{BIO 4776826 <GO>}
Got you, Okay, that's very helpful. Appreciate the color there. Switching gears to asset optimization. Understanding that you do not need equity in the 5-year plan, you've been very clear about that. But when you look at LDCs trading hands at nearly two times rate base, how do you think about the opportunity to sell an asset at that level and then reinvest the proceeds into decarbonization efforts, to your electric utilities?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Well, I think we've demonstrated over the years that were both in the world of M&A, were both buyers and sellers. What we're always seeking to do is put assets in the hands of the best owner, that's just kind of our dogma and I think we follow through on it. You know, what's interesting about our gas properties is that they have been able to contribute like 10% earnings per share growth, primarily focused on safety-related pipeline replacement programs.

Since the acquisition of what is now Southern Company Gas, we have well exceeded our expectations on the acquisition. So in order to think about you know cap allocation as you do, and we think about it all the time, selling something like our asset in Illinois relative to reinvesting in the core, we always have to consider what's best for our long-term growth rate, what's best on a risk-adjusted basis, we will continually do that.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yeah. And James, you made the point in your question, I mean we don't have an identified equity need in the forecast and we think our LDC is a great property.

Q - James Ward{BIO 4776826 <GO>}
Yeah Got it.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
It would be purely a value play as oppose to a need.

Q - James Ward{BIO 4776826 <GO>}
Right. Got you. And then one final one here just to follow on from Julien's question earlier. To clarify here, so given that the Vogtle co-owners are already protected by cost caps and this is just at a high level here, is there any incentive or other reason that we should be aware of or that might be worth keeping in mind for why Oglethorpe or MEAG would not want to proceed at this point? Since we have this cost caps in place, just help us understand what they might be thinking?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
We're not aware of any reason that exist like that.

Q - James Ward{BIO 4776826 <GO>}
Got it. Got it.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
They have to go through their processes.

Q - James Ward{BIO 4776826 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you very much. Those are all my questions. Thank you for taking the time.

Our next question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Hey, Jeremy.

Q - Jeremy Tonet{BIO 15946844 <GO>}
Hi, good afternoon, thanks for having me. Maybe just come back to Vogtle real quick here. Just trying to get a little bit more clarity, have any of the missing inspection reports resulted in the need to rework completed sections of the plant? And also just curious if the NRC is kind of weighed in here on the ITAAC issue and any thoughts you have as far as what could be done in the future for our Vogtle 4 to -- controls that could be implemented to avoid these issues?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yeah. Interestingly, I was just in Augusta visiting with Glen Chick, I think he's just a superlative manager of the site, along with Steve Kuczynski and we actually went through different systems at this point and we are trying, we are efforting to begin with the inspection report fix with what we believe are the toughest, hardest issues to deal with, can't guarantee that but so far, with 30% complete, we haven't found the need for any of that comprehensive rework. Certainly as we see things that aren't according to specs or per an inspection requirement, then we will fix it, but nothing comprehensive as you're suggesting. Second question?

Q - Jeremy Tonet{BIO 15946844 <GO>}
Well, I was just curious, I guess that's helpful there. Thank you for that and the NRC, if they've kind of weighed in on the ITAAC issues and any --?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Oh NRC, yeah, thanks, jeremy, hey, you know the NRC posture, again, I think I say pretty regularly, they're a very tough requiring regulator. But we think they do a great job and that's the reason why the United States nuclear fleet is the envy of the world. Getting it right, as we so often say, will allow us to have an asset that will provide energy carbon-free, resilient for 60 to 80 years. So we're all in on getting it right, the NRC likewise is their primary focus. In other words, they are not as concerned, I'm guessing with schedule and cost. They want to make sure that whatever we build is as appropriate to nuclear safety standards as exists in America today. So they support our efforts to find these things. And I think for the amount of ITAAC that we've already submitted, something like 275 or so. I think we've had very few problems with those ITAAC, that process has gone well, which says that once we get the work packages turned over and all of the paper done in nuclear standard as it is supposed to be, we've had an enormous success rate in dealing with the NRC part of the equation.

Q - Jeremy Tonet{BIO 15946844 <GO>}
Got it. That's really helpful there. And then just pivoting a bit towards SMRs, I just wondering if you could discuss Southern involvement with SMRs. And the way you see the tech going over the coming years? And do you think there'll be support to (Inaudible) if the technology is proven up in the future? Just wondering if you've had conversations with commissioners or other stakeholders on if this could be potential down the road?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yeah, my conversations with kind of future nuclear technologies have really been more -- I haven't talked to the states at all, that really would be the realm of Mark Crosswhite in Alabama, or Chris Womack in Georgia or Anthony Wilson in Mississippi. In my conversations with DOE, with folks in that ilk or in the administration, I've had those conversations too, in my opinion, I know other people are more bullish on SMRs than I am, but you still have to deal with enormous security issues, you still have to deal with kind of the nimby issues associated with nuclear.

So I've always felt nuclear lends itself to scale. Now SMRs do absolutely have an important place in our nuclear future, my opinion would be in the niche areas like military bases, the military RA does SMRs and submarines and aircraft carriers. So, it's easy to conceive SMR showing up on big nuclear installations. It also provides them a degree of resilience. I get that. We have been and we participate in SMRs, you should know that.

So our nuclear team and our R&D team are involved in the SMR process. We've actually been asked to get involved in a significant way in SMRs, and given, I don't want to be distracted with anything other than getting Vogtle 3 and 4 done, we've really stayed away from that. On the other hand, we view great progress potential with the so-called Gen four reactors, the molten chloride salts, you know we've worked with Bill Gates and his team on that, we are, you know when you think about the R&D S-curve, I think we've done a lot of work on the science, I would call it the bench science of it and the very small kind of element of starting up that S-curve. The next kind of big slugs of development on the Gen 4 reactors will require hundreds of millions of dollars. I know I've talked with the Secretary Granholm, Deputy Secretary Turk, other folks that it would be great as the DOE is looking to put money to work, especially in the technology development area.

This is a place where we could partner with the federal government and really move quickly up that S-curve to make Gen four reactors of commercial reality. In our own planning processes, they start to show up as an option, probably in late 2030. So let's say 2035 up to 2040, and as an economic matter, they tend to compete with CCS-controlled combined cycle technologies. So depending on how the technology and cost expectations evolve, you will see us either continue with combined cycles and capturing the carbon and sequestering it or pursuing new Gen four reactors, but again that's an issue that's going to show up in the very late 2030s.

Q - Jeremy Tonet{BIO 15946844 <GO>}
Got it. Maybe just a real quick follow-up here, curious on advanced nuclear, thanks for your thoughts there. But as far as what technologies could make the most sense, just wondering light water, what Vogtle is doing versus molten salt or other technologies, just wondering what you think of give and takes between them?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Well, I think the obvious difference between the kind of what we're building at Vogtle and the so-called Gen four reactors, is this issue of the fuel in the core. Effectively, the Gen 4 reactors have the characteristic that a meltdown is virtually impossible. And therefore, you need fewer containment structures and therefore less capital cost in order to put those units into play and have them be safe as we expect them to be.

That is the real big difference, it's a capital cost difference associated with how the, how the reactors meltdown characteristic could occur.

Q - James Ward{BIO 4776826 <GO>}
Very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks so much.

Q - Jeremy Tonet{BIO 15946844 <GO>}

Operator
Our next question is from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Hey Angie, great to have you with us.

Q - Angie Storozynski{BIO 15115714 <GO>}
Thanks. So I have a question, I don't think I've ever asked the question about Southern Power. I'm looking at your past disclosure and it seems like your gas plants are on the head to about 80%, meaning the contract (Inaudible) about 80% of the output. We've seen quite an expansion of spark spreads across the country. I struggle with your regions. So it's what, Georgia, Alabama, and North Carolina. I'm not sure if that translates into higher dispatch or earnings of these assets, again if you could comment?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yeah. Angie, I don't know, we'll have to run the numbers down with you, our own math would say they're 92% contracted for about 10 years.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
And importantly, Angie, so in front of the Georgia Public Service Commission, as part of the IRP, the vast majority of the gas PPAs that are in front them for approval are Southern Power gas plants. And so that's going to extend those units' coverage for another 10 years.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
And recall that we follow the same kinds of the rubric in contracting our assets as opposed to merchant players, in that, we don't take fuel risk, we earn a return on and return of capital and pass through the fuel and energy price.

Q - Angie Storozynski{BIO 15115714 <GO>}
Okay. (multispeaker)

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Angie, excuse me. I'll just give you one more data point. 95% contracted through 2026, 92% through 2031. that's the nerdy data.

Q - Angie Storozynski{BIO 15115714 <GO>}
Good. Now just going back to Vogtle, so yes,I've read, I actually just re-read the agreements, the ownership agreement and the ends that additional background about COVID-related costs. So we are still sitting in the COVID era. So I'm assuming that at least some of this incremental cost related to the asset is still related to COVID? And how does that come into this whole discussion about the sharing agreement with the co-owners? And then secondly, you haven't mentioned inflation and so I'm just wondering, how is that impacting the cost profile of this, of this construction project?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yeah. And thanks for that. This is my opinion. I'm giving you as opposed to fact I guess. But in my opinion. It is unquestionable. It is unreasonable to assume that COVID had no impact. And so the real art of the deal is to figure out how much of that impact manifested itself.

If you dial back out to those dark days when the first COVID thing hit and we were deciding whether to shut the project down or not? I think it's very clear that we had to operate under a completely different operating regime on the site. Remember, we stood up a medical village we did all sorts of things in order to continue this very important project. We have estimates that we provided to Georgia Public Service Commission, I don't think we've updated those recently. But certainly, I think any reasonable person would say that there had been COVID impacts on the site.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yeah. And I would just say in terms of this most recent cost increase, it's certainly not the driver, it's not a major driver but Tom's point it's logically an element of what's going on.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
And I think we provided the chart in the appendix material, where you can see even this most recent whatever this thing is, Omicron, it had an enormous spike in the December to January timeframe. So certainly, it had an impact.

We saw it in, especially over the holidays, we always expect to see more absenteeism and a variety of other thing. We certainly saw it there as well. But it's fair to say, like everyone is, with every wave, with every impact, we are getting better at working in this environment and it becomes increasingly less disruptive and thus less of the cost impact.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
And let me hit one other kind of controversial point, but we watch this like hawks. Recall at one time, we had 9,000 people on site and there was a lot of concern was this somehow a COVID hotbed? Well, in fact the data shows that our COVID experience is just about similar to the surrounding communities. We don't have a different experience on the site than in the surrounding counties.

Q - James Ward{BIO 4776826 <GO>}
Yes, thank you. How about inflation now? Is it already embedded in this additional cost estimate?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yeah. But, Angie, most of the inflation sensitive stuff is already procured. Our supply chains are already spoken for, all the major equipments there, I suppose there would be some labor, we're paying top decile right now. You know I suppose that could come up later but it hasn't been a big effect now.

Q - Angie Storozynski{BIO 15115714 <GO>}
Okay. And then the last question. So looking how strong your earnings were, I mean have been, actually over the last couple of years, now, despite unfavorable weather, so is the low growth the main driver or is it just cost efficiencies? What is putting you above the high end of your guidance almost consistently despite unfavorable weather?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Dan's done a great job managing the cost structures of the system. Actually Dan didn't have anything to do with it, all the people in the operating companies did. But I'll tell you the big surprise, I said this on Squawk Box this morning, and the data we've provided you shows it, we beat our residential estimates by 2.7%. In other words, we were projecting that to be down and it was actually up and we think that that is due to a change in lifestyle.

I think we budgeted as if we thought there was this return to work, and therefore we would see like a 2.2% reduction in residential sales because people are showing up at work, well, in fact, our own data, if you look at Southern Company's experience, our old model was about 80% of the people came to work every day.

I think now and there were 20% that were virtual, probably call centers. Now we're seeing about only 25% are here every day with about 50% hybrid, they are coming in and out, a few days a week, some more, some less, and then about 25% virtual. What's interesting about that is the sales in the residential sector were sustained at a much higher level than what we thought. We thought they'd drop off, they actually increased a bit. That uplift really helped us this year.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yeah. And just as you look at our forecast. Look, we certainly haven't assumed that that continues into the future, because one year doesn't make a trend, but we reasonably believe it might. So if you look at our forecast for residential sales for 2022, it actually reflects year-over-year negative,and that's frankly, mitigated by assumption of strong customer growth. So to your point answer there's certainly a upside even in 2022 if we see these trends continue.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
The customer growth has been awfully attractive, so over 50,000 on the electric side, what was it, 27,000 something like that on the gas side. So we continue to do that and we think that is kind of a function too, of people being able to work remotely and so they tend to go to places that have low input cost, attractive place to live.

Our economic development data shows that as well. So I think some of the stuff Dan, you talked about in the script.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
It just looks good, particularly for Georgia. But even Alabama is coming back. And we're doing well. We have reason to be bullish about the long-term viability of our franchise.

Q - Angie Storozynski{BIO 15115714 <GO>}
Very good. Thank you.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Thank you, Angie.

Operator
Our next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Hello, Steve. Hope you're doing well?

Q - Steve Fleishman{BIO 1512318 <GO>}
Yeah. You too. Tom. And Dan.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Thanks.

Q - Steve Fleishman{BIO 1512318 <GO>}
So two questions, first, just on the Vogtle ITAAC issues. I know you knew all along that the paperwork and the trail of all that was super important and you've been doing all the work so correct, could you give us a little flavor of just what has gone wrong here because it because obviously it's something that you were very focused on from the beginning?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
100% Steve and I think you know I said this in media earlier but it's true I get up every morning throughout the day, in the middle of the night, thinking about Vogtle, and what we can do and all that. And I was, I was, the folks at the site have been, particularly frustrated at this recent development. When we left you on the call and I guess it was late October early November,everybody the site too was very bullish on the fact that man, here we go, we're getting ready to file for 103-G and load fuel in, the whole bit.

And when we started getting into the final systems, related to the final ITAAC. So like, we've done 100 and -- I mean, we've done 275, we had 123 left. We had already done in order to complete these tests and a lot of this equipment has already operated within the testing regimes, we had done on physical and visual inspection.

But what we found when we got ready to turnover these systems for the paper, an important part of the paper, are these inspection report? And we found in many cases, they were just either incomplete or missing. Let me give you an example. But this is an example, this is relevant. For every bolt in that plant theoretically, we would have to ascertain certificates the provenance of that bolt. In other words, we'd have to prove that we know that the metallurgy worked and where it came from and everything else.

Due to the extent and inspection report did not account for the provenance of a bolt, we had to either take the bolt out and put it in the bolt that was certified or take the bolt out and test it to make sure that it met our standards. This is at the very end of the process for the very final equipment and systems that were related to the turnover before we filed for 103G. This is at the tail end of the process and we found this out. We just had to go stop. We've got to do a complete review of all of these inspection reports and that's what you see right now, you know.

Q - Steve Fleishman{BIO 1512318 <GO>}
Got it.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
I know -- I am frustrated about it but it is something we have to do. We talk about this is the first plant we've constructed in 40 years. Well, this is the first nuclear documentation we've had to do in 40 years. I wish we had found it sooner. We just didn't.

Q - Steve Fleishman{BIO 1512318 <GO>}
Okay and then totally separate topic, you were, I think, Tom was pretty accurate with caution about the build back better getting done last year, and I'm just curious how you're feeling about maybe a climate-only type package getting done in Congress this year?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Strictly my opinion and I was in the meeting with the President and all that. You know it's interesting and I work with both sides of the aisle here. I think long term, both parties agree that we should do something. I think the methods of doing something, especially in light of the inflation signals we are seeing and potentially the national security issues, we are seeing right now, lend themselves to nothing happening for the rest of the year. I wish it would. I don't think it will.

Q - Steve Fleishman{BIO 1512318 <GO>}
Right, okay. I appreciate your thoughts. Thank you.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Yes, sir.

Operator
Our next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please go ahead.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Hey, Paul always great to have you with us.

Q - James Ward{BIO 4776826 <GO>}
Thanks a lot. I guess my first question is going to be on turnovers. I think initially, you had talked about doing some of the turnovers, those that were necessary to load fuel and delaying other turnovers that you thought were less necessary, in light of the documentation issues are you now looking to do all of the turnovers before you load fuel?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
No, I think, I think there is a set you have to turn over in order to get to 103G and there could be some others in between 103G and loading fuel. Let me give you a little bit of kind of where we are. So on Unit 3, we're not doing big hunky things, there is a little less than a 100 systems, 96 or so. You would split those into 152 sub subsystems, okay? So there is 11 total to go and since our last call, we've gotten 5 of those turnovers complete. If I think about what's remaining here, I would say that we have 3 to go for 103 G and 6 to go on fuel load and 2 that we can complete after fuel load, there are not necessary to the nuclear safety side of things. Was that helpful?

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
Absolutely. In the past, I think you've estimated or you've put out estimates of COVID-related costs that went as high as 400, in the upcoming VCM 26 filing, are you going to update your estimate of COVID-related costs or not?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yeah, the 400, the 444 was at 100% dollars, our share that with 160. I don't know the status of that, it didn't come up recently. So I think it's still an open issue.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
And there was some degree of estimating future impacts in the original number and I think it's been consistent with that.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
So we've not provided an update.

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
Is that for 440 the sort of the most recent number that you've put out publicly?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yeah.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yeah. And so you typically see us disclose it as 160 to 200. That's our share, 440 is $100. And just to be clear, there is no change like that in VCM '23.

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
You're saying no change?

A - Unidentified Speaker
Correct.

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
In VCM 26.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
We just haven't created an addition based on the latest omicron effects. I mean clearly, there were, we just haven't updated of the estimate.

Q - James Ward{BIO 4776826 <GO>}
And then the numbers you put out for the cost-sharing potential write-offs or after-tax numbers, can we get pre-tax numbers for those? The 480 and the 440?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yeah, Those are pre-tax, Paul. Those are pre-tax.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
So that adds 920, 686 is the after-tax portion. Yeah.

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
If you look at our deck on slide 6, then there is 920 listed there and that's pre-tax, total after-tax for that is 686, and then we've broken down the components, but all those all that breakdown is pretax.

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
All that is pre-tax, okay. And then the most, the highest number of ITACC that you've done any given month, I think is 18. How confident are you in being able to sort of do mid 30s type numbers once you're able to sort of do the catch-up work on the documentation?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yeah, Paul, which you have to understand and back where we were in October, November, we're basically finishing the work and what we found is the inspection reports were lacking. So this work is ready to go. The table is set. Once we get the documentation done, we'll be ready to send those things in, we feel good about this schedule.And it's not that we're finishing construction.

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
And in terms of the, So are you completely done with all of the construction or the remediation work for Unit 3 that you had identified sort of in the fall?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yeah, no, I meant, I just mentioned, like, an example of some of the remediation that might have to be done in order to conform with an inspection report. So there are other examples. But that's it.

Q - James Ward{BIO 4776826 <GO>}
Okay. And then maybe the last question, the contracting of the Southern power plants under the Georgia IRP, it sounds like, The net income that you're earning is based on some book value calculation on the plants. So, with the Georgia IRP if it were adopted at least with respect to the Southern power plants likely the earnings from those plants would remain roughly the same, or would there be any type of sort of, would there be any material change?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
I think the short answer. Paul is no material change. These are market contracts. So all of these contracts are being awarded to Southern Power under a competitive RFP process. And so it's going to reflect the current market for those 10-year contracts.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Over the life of the contract, the IRRs would be similar. And when you think about what we have said about the market broadly is that we kind of pulled back from the market. This is kind of elsewhere in the United States because there was so much supply and the demand was waning and there was a lot of uncertainty, we saw the margins really getting tight And so we didn't play, but for the things we do that we ultimately will sign up for pretty consistent IRRs and pretty consistent ROEs. The ROEs typically are what we did better than what we would find in our regulated jurisdiction, reflective of a little bit of the higher risk.

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
Great. And the last question for me. The 686, should we assume either equity or asset sales to fund that?

A - Daniel S. Tucker{BIO 17322316 <GO>}
Yeah. So again, I think I said in my prepared remarks, Paul, that we don't see a need for equity in this 5-year outlook. So let me just hit that a little more broadly because I think it's important, but absolutely nothing has changed about our near-term or long-term objectives when it comes to credit quality, we've said, kind of over the last several months that as we move closer to completion of the project, any change in the cost or schedule will evaluate to see if equity is needed.

Essentially, because we are getting so close to the end. And because of all the proactive things that we did in response to other changes. And frankly, we did a little bit more than what was needed. So that has positioned us really well and I want to also emphasize the improvement in the metrics that comes later on. I think we put a slide in the appendix that shows some of the components of the uplift in FFO that will occur in the '23, '24 timeframe that also is a near enough time horizon to give us comfort with our overall financial profile.

Q - Paul Fremont{BIO 1745706 <GO>}
Great. I think that's it. In terms of questions.

Thank you. Awesome.

Operator
Our next question is from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Lapides{BIO 6317499 <GO>}
Hey, guys, tom.

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Hey Tom, how are you doing?

Q - Michael Lapides{BIO 6317499 <GO>}
I'm all right guys. Thank you for taking my question. I appreciate you taking the time. Commodity prices are up across the board, obviously, that's a bigger issue than any one team or person who can manage, how should we think about given what's happening to commodity prices and given the investment you're making some of which, like Vogtel will help reduce the commodity exposure, how should we just think about the bill across your biggest businesses? Something in Alabama and Georgia Power, I'm thinking about the bill and for Southern Company Gas like what's happening in the total bill for the customer.

As we enter 2022 and think about 23 as well?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yeah, it's interesting stuff, man. When you look at the data, gas prices increased '21 versus '20, 92%. you're like -- we averaged, I think $382 per million BTU versus a $1.99 a year ago. So that's kind of a big deal. Now each of our jurisdictions have managed I think well their unrecovered fuel balances. Georgia just got an increase. It doesn't wipe it out completely, but it did really well. Alabama used some of its earnings otherwise, in 2021 it completely wiped out its fuel balance. So one of the things we are very mindful of and I appreciate the way you phrased the question. We are very mindful of the burden to customers and we manage that like hawks, I think we're in really good shape right now.

Q - Michael Lapides{BIO 6317499 <GO>}
Okay. I know you've done a lot of work over the years with the Federal Reserve in Atlanta, just curious how the commodity how, when you think about just the economic impact to the service territory and you've got a high growth service territory relative to a lot of your peers, how does this kind of how do you think about it, when you meet with folks outside of the company about what it means for economic growth?

A - Tom Fanning{BIO 1930890 <GO>}
Yeah, very interesting stuff. If you look at the data, we're seeing even our industrial numbers, I said this on Squawk today. While it will show that it looks like things are slowing down a bit on the Industrial sales side, the momentum numbers would tell you that essentially the first derivative. In fact, 2 of the segments that underperformed or decreased year-over-year were chemicals and paper. But the paper was newsprint had a big closure of plant there.

The chemicals were a chemical plant, caustic soda and chlorine, that closed as well. If you wipe away those two big plant closures. Our Industrial sales actually were better than what we expected. Again, so pretty good stuff. Now, it is very clear that inflation will eventually eat into the growth of the economy. I was kind of visiting with some of the Fed work and all of that here recently. You're familiar with the old permanent income hypothesis.

I think people have felt wealthier lately and people are still spending as if inflation hasn't visited them yet, it is inconceivable though that that won't catch up at some point. You saw these hot retail sales. My sense is as inflation effects continue that those sales will start to wane, so there will be a slowdown in the economy. Now the real $50,000 question is, when does inflation start to recede a bit? A lot of stuff right now says that a 2023 issue that we could start inflation getting back to a.

You're getting back to a more normal level. I think the underlying presumption in that the supply chain is that the supply chain works itself out. right now We've had such an imbalance in supply and demand that prices invariably are high and for the lead time to procure certain goods and services, it is really sticky right now. So the big swings are supply chain unwinding and getting back to normal people adjusting to higher prices and therefore reduced spending and therefore reduce heat in the economy.

Those are all the factors that I think will go into this point, for now, the economy. I mean it looks really good in the Southeast, but I think it inconceivable to me that it won't slow down a bit over the next year or so.

Q - Michael Lapides{BIO 6317499 <GO>}
Got it. And then one last one, just thinking about whether you do the gigawatt of storage at Georgia Power? obviously that that kind of depends on the end of the IRP process as well as if you were to wind up doing more incremental solar at either George our Alabama Power orat Southern Power. How are you thinking about the renewable supply chain because been lots of discussion and commentary someone or 2 of your peers have talked about the supply chain becoming an issue for their non-regulated contracted solar business.

I'm just curious what insights you're team's getting in terms of the ability to procure things, like panels or lithium-ion other and the ability to actually install at the pace, you'd like to install.

Yeah. So, Michael, this is Dan. So right now we're not in a big construction period and so we're fortunate to not be experiencing as acutely as some of our peers. Right now some of those, we've seen some, we are in the middle of the storage project out in California. We've seen some modest delays, but nothing that's going to impact the project. Overall, that's part of the supply chain, and then really combined with I think how everyone is seeing the near-term markets is why we also have this ramp up and our expectations for Southern Power, you heard me say we've allocated just the $250 million this year $500 the following year.

And that's really a recognition that there are projects actively on our radar screen today and we're a bit aspirational that those might come to fruition, but to the extent they don't. I think what you'll see us logically do is push those dollars out a little further in time and have opportunities later.

There is another conversation. I've been having in DC, whether it's Secretary Granholm who has been terrific (inaudible) David Turk is a terrific guy. You know, as a matter of national security. As a matter of economic opportunity. One of the things that we need to do as a nation is the resource these important supply chain domestically, that will grow manufacturing, grows jobs, grow personal incomes, it's a real winner.

And I think some of the money that's been put out in the incentives, whether it's inside DOE right now, or in the infrastructure bill elsewhere is to think about ways to promote the domestic supply of these things and really get it going. Now, when I say that you're talking 5 years from now, that isn't going to happen immediately, but people are considering it, and I'll betcha you would get broad bipartisan support for that strategy.

And that does conclude our question and answer session. Sir. Are there any closing remarks?

Thank you all for attending with us this afternoon. This was an important call, this is a frustrating time for us all, we were ready to go there we thought, kind of early this year, and now with this delay, it looks as if will be the end of the year for Unit 3 and we've allowed for an additional quarter, just given the uncertainty that we've seen in the past. We think these schedules align closer to what the staff and the Commission have been kind of thinking about, but I can assure you, we're on the case, we all spend our time at the site.

Those people are fixated on getting it right along with our partners (inaudible) and when we build this thing, we'll get it in service. We are right at the end of that process. It will be of the quality that is necessary in the United States nuclear industry and we're going to be proud of it for decades to come. Otherwise, the company is performing as well as it possibly can, whether it's our reliability, our resilience. our customer satisfaction. The way our employees feel, we were number one in military employers. Look, all of these data, they sound like kind of headlines and billboards and tabloid, but I think they really speak to our dogma here at Southern, that this is a company built to last, that these indicators are things that will prove that we are sustainable in our business model for years-and-years to come. And we're very proud of that.

And I want to thank all the thousands of employees at Southern for making that their part of their day, every day, it's way beyond making, moving and selling, it's all wound up and making sure that the communities we serve are better off because we're there. We do that every day and we will continue to do that. We look forward to getting the project behind us and getting into 2024 and our financial position, the integrity of this company will be better than it ever has been in my experience. So thank you and we'll talk to you soon.
