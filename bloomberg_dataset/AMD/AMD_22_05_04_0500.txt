Hello and welcome to the AMD First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Laura Graves, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations. Laura, please go ahead.

Laura Graves{BIO 15126067 <GO>}
Thank you, and welcome to AMD's first-quarter 2022 financial results conference call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings press release and accompanying slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the investor relations page of amd.com.

Today, we will discuss AMD's first-quarter results including partial quarter contributions from the acquisition of Xilinx, which closed on February 14th, 2022. We will also discuss AMD results on a standalone basis for the first quarter of 2022. We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call. The full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations are available in today's press release and in the slides posted on our website.

Participants on today's conference call are Dr.Lisa Su, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer; Victor Ping, President of AMD's Adaptive and Embedded Computing Group will also join us for Q&A. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website.

Before we begin, I would like to note, AMD will host its 2022 Financial Analyst Day on Thursday, June 9th, and our second quarter fire time is expected to begin at the close of business on Friday, June 17th. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on current beliefs, assumptions, and expectations, speak only as of today, and as such involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.

Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Lisa Su. Lisa?

Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. For the last several years, we have been on a journey to both scale and transform AMD. We have consistently executed our strategy, expanded our portfolio of leadership products, and diversified our business, all while driving best-in-class growth.

We reached a significant inflection point in our journey during the first few months of 2022, as we took several major steps that fundamentally reshape our business. In addition to delivering record financial results, we closed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx and announced our plans to acquire Pensando. The strategic importance of the Xilinx acquisition to our long-term goals cannot be overstated.

As the industry's number one provider of FPGA and Adaptive Computing Solutions, Xilinx significantly expands our technology and product portfolio. Xilinx also adds multiple high-margin long-term revenue streams, spanning a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model.

Importantly, Xilinx has successfully executed its own growth strategy in recent years with the increased adoption of adaptive silicon across data center, communications, automotive, and other large embedded markets. With Pensando, we will further expand our data center solutions capabilities.

Pensando will add a proven team that has developed an industry-leading DPU and software stack already deployed with key customers including IBM, HPE, Microsoft, Oracle, and Goldman Sachs. Pensando has differentiated technology further expands our product portfolio and will enable AMD to innovate at the Silicon software and platform levels to deliver leadership solutions for our cloud, enterprise, and edge customers.

Now turning to our first-quarter financial performance. We started the year very strong with record quarterly revenue and net income. First-quarter revenue including the contributions from six weeks of Xilinx grew 71% year-over-year to a record $5.9 billion.

We expanded gross margin 7 percentage points to 53% and more than doubled, both operating and net income year-over-year. Excluding Xilinx, revenue grew 55% year-over-year to a record $5.3 billion. Gross margin expanded 5 percentage points to 51%, and operating income more than doubled to a record $1.6 billion.

Turning to our computing and graphics segment, revenue increased 33% year-over-year to (inaudible) billion, driven primarily by the ramp of our latest Ryzen and Radeon products. While[ph] compute revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year based on a higher rise in mobile and desktop processor sales. As a result, we believe we gain client processor revenue share for the eighth straight quarter.

In desktop, we expanded our processor portfolio with the introduction of seven new Ryzen CPU, including the Ryzen 3800X3D CPU, which is the industry's fastest gaming CPU and first desktop processor featuring 3D stack triplets. Processor revenue was driven by the launch of our Rembrandt Ryzen 6,000 mobile processors, that extends -- compute gaming and battery life capabilities of our mobile processors.

In commercial, we recently induced our latest Ryzen 6000 Pro processors with leadership performance and battery life, and modern security, and manageability features. We are well-positioned to accelerate our growth in commercial notebooks in 2022, based on the expanded number of design wins on track to launch.

Although the PC market is experiencing some softness, coming off multiple quarters of near-record unit shipments. Our focus remains on the premium gaming and commercial portions of the market where we see strong growth opportunities, and we expect to continue gaining overall client revenue share.

In graphics, revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year with record desktop graphics channel sales. Desktop GPU sales, nearly doubled, year-over-year as sales of our Radeon 6000 series graphics cards were strong. In Mobile, the first notebooks, featuring our latest Radeon 6000 mobile GPUS launched in the quarter, and we expect sales to ramp over the coming quarters.

Datacenter graphics revenue was flat year-over-year as we launched our instinct MI-2 10 accelerators. We expanded our engagements with large cloud customers in the quarter and launched our rockin[ph] five software suite targeting excess scale class, HPC, and AI applications.

Turning to our enterprise invented in semi-custom segment revenue increased 88% year-over-year to $2.5 billion driven by record server, semi-custom, and embedded processor sales. Semi-custom sales grew by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year based on strong demand for Sony and Microsoft consoles, as well as Valve's new Steam Deck. Sales for this game console generation continue to outpace all prior generations, and we expect 2022 to be a record year for our semi-custom business.

Turning to our embedded business. Revenue more than doubled year-over-year, led by growth in automotive. We also secured multiple design wins in next-generation security and firewall devices from Tier-1 networking providers.

Turning to server. We had another record quarter as revenue more than doubled year-over-year and increased by a double-digit percentage sequentially. We have more than doubled server processor revenue year-over-year in 8 of the last 10 quarters, highlighting the growing demand for our epic processors with Cloud, Enterprise, and HPC customers.

Cloud revenue more than doubled year-over-year as hyper scalars expanded their internal infrastructure deployments and 70 new AMD-powered instances launched from Alibaba, Amazon -- Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Google, and others. There are now more than 460 AMD-based cloud instances available from the largest hyper scalars with additional instances on track to launch in the mean quarters.

In Enterprise, revenue more than doubled year-over-year with strong growth in key verticals, including IT infrastructure, financial services, and database applications. Our sales pipeline continues to be very strong and we saw our win rate grow in the first quarter across a broad set of Enterprise and customers.

We launched our first EPYC processors with 3D stack triplets in the quarter. This Technology extends our performance leadership and tactical computing workloads by up to 66% compared to our prior generation. Otto's, Cisco, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Supermicro, all launch servers featuring the new CPUs in the quarter.

(Inaudible) to our next generation, Genoa server processors continues to grow as we expanded customer and partnering sampling in the quarter. We expect Genoa will be the industry's highest performance general-purpose server CPU further extending the performance, energy efficiency and TCO advantages of our EPYC processors.

We remain on track to launch Genoa in the second half of the year and expect to continue our share gain trajectory based on expanded cloud, enterprise, and HPC customer adoption. In addition, the development of our higher core count Bergamo processors optimized for high throughput cloud workloads continues to progress well, with shipments on track to begin in the first half of 2023.

Turning to the Xilinx business for the six weeks following acquisition close. Xilinx revenue was $559 million. On a pro forma basis for the full quarter, Xilinx delivered its fourth straight quarter of greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth and the second straight quarter of greater than $1 billion of revenue.

In data center, first-quarter demand was led by expanded FPGA as a service, and SmartNIC deployments at Tier 1 hyper scalars as well as low latency networking solutions with Fintech companies. We saw strength and Communications led by wired demand and access in optical transport.

In wireless, Versal-based 5G deployments continue ramping in multiple regions, and we secured a strategic design win with Tier 1 communications equipment provider to power their next-gen baseband solutions with the Versal ACAP solution.

We saw a strong demand across the Xilinx embedded markets, led by record Pro-forma full quarter revenue in automotive, industrial, vision, and healthcare, and consumer. Looking forward, we see very strong demand across all of the Xilinx's end markets and are focused on increasing supply.

Turning to our integration work. In the first few months since close, we have seen tremendous excitement from our customers, partners, and employees. And we expect to see a significant product and revenue synergies.

We now have the best portfolio of high-performance in adaptive computing engines in the industry, and we see multiple opportunities to leverage our expanded technology portfolio to deliver even stronger products.

As one example, we're integrating Xilinx's differentiated AI engine across our CPU product portfolio to enable industry-leading inference capabilities with the first products expected in 2023. We have also identified significant additional revenue synergy opportunities with some of our largest customers, as we can now address a larger portion of their compute needs with our expanded product portfolio.

In summary, the start of 2022 is a significant inflection point for AMD, marked by a record, top, and bottom-line financial results driven by our leadership product portfolio and strong execution, and the close of our Xilinx acquisition.

We have now delivered greater than 45 % year-over-year revenue growth for seven straight quarters and increased net income by more than 60% year-over-year for the last 10 quarters.

Based on higher AMD organic growth, as well as the addition of Xilinx with strong demand across multiple end markets, we now expect annual revenue to grow by approximately 60% year-over-year, up from approximately 31% growth we guided at the beginning of the year.

Longer-term, I'm incredibly excited about our additional growth opportunities as we add the Xilinx and Pensando teams. We now see a significantly larger TAM opportunity for AMD across a diverse set of end markets, based on our broader portfolio of leadership compute engines and expanded solutions capabilities.

I look forward to sharing more about the products and technologies that will enable the next stage of our growth journey at financial Analyst Day in June.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first-quarter financial performance. Devinder?

Devinder Kumar{BIO 17763436 <GO>}
Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon everyone. The first quarter was an excellent start to the year with strong demand for leadership products, resulting in record quarterly-- quarterly revenue, continued gross margin expansion, record profitability, and record cash flow generation.

In addition, we are very pleased to have closed the Xilinx transaction and announced our intention to acquire Pensando. First-quarter consolidated revenue was $5.9 billion, up 71% from a year ago, driven by significant growth across all businesses and the inclusion of Xilinx's revenue for the partial period.

Excluding the Xilinx's contribution, AMD revenue was $5.3 billion, up 55% from a year ago with data center revenue doubling year-over-year. Gross margin was 53%, up 660 basis points from a year ago, driven by higher server processor revenue and high-margin Xilinx revenue.

Gross margin for AMD, excluding Xilinx was 51%, up 480 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by higher server processor revenue. Operating expenses of $1.3 billion compared to $830 million a year ago as we increase investments in our long-term product roadmaps to support the future growth of our business.

Operating income more than doubled from a year ago to a record $1.8 billion, up $1.1 billion, primarily driven by significant revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 31%, up from 22% a year ago. Net income was a record $1.6 billion, up $947 million from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $1.39 per share compared to $0.52 per share a year ago.

Now, turning to first-quarter business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.8 billion, up 33% year-over-year, driven by higher client and graphics processor revenue. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $723 million or 26% of revenue compared to $485 million or 23% of revenue a year ago.

The increase in operating income was driven primarily by higher revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses. Enterprise embedded and semi-custom segment revenue was $2.5 billion up 88% from $1.3 billion in the prior year. The strong revenue increase was driven by a higher server, semi-custom, and embedded revenue.

EESE segment operating income grew significantly to $881 million or 35% of revenue compared to $277 million or 21% of revenue a year ago. The higher operating income and margin were driven by increased revenue, a richer product mix, and an $83 million licensing gain.

Xilinx revenue for the partial quarter was $559 million with an operating income of $233 million or 42% of revenue. On a Pro-forma basis for the full quarter, Xilinx generated over $1 billion of revenue, up 22% compared to a year ago with growth across all Xilinx's major end market categories. We're on track to achieve our costs synergy goals for the acquisition and expect the addition of Xilinx to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share for 2022.

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $6.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. We deployed $1.9 billion to repurchase common stock in the first quarter. To date, we have utilized $3.7 billion of our initial $4 billion stock repurchase program. We also announced a new $8 billion share repurchase program during the quarter.

In total, we had $8.3 billion in remaining authorization at the end of the first quarter. Quarterly free cash flow was a record $924 million compared to $832 million in the same quarter last year and $736 million in the prior quarter. We successfully executed a five-year $3 billion sustainability link credit facility to replace our existing $500 million facility.

This further demonstrates our commitment to our corporate ESG goals. Inventory was $2.4 billion, up $476 million from the prior quarter, due to the addition of Xilinx inventory. Before I turn to our financial outlook, let me cover our financial segment reporting.

Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we plan to change our segment reporting to the following four segments; data center, client, gaming and embedded, which will align our financial reporting with our strategic end markets. I look forward to sharing further details with you at our Financial Analyst Day.

Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer demand signals. For the second quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $6.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million, and an increase of approximately 69% year-over-year and approximately 10% quarter-over-quarter.

The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by the addition of Xilinx revenue plus higher server, semi-custom, and client revenue. The quarter-over-quarter increase is expected to be primarily driven by Xilinx revenue plus higher server revenue.

In addition for Q2 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.56 billion or 24% of revenue. Non-GAAP interest expense, taxes, and other to be approximately $270 million, based on the 13% effective tax rate, and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.64 billion shares.

For the full-year 2022, we now expect revenue to be approximately $26.3 billion, an increase of approximately 60%, driven by Xilinx, and higher server and semi-custom revenue. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, and non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 24% of revenue. Non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%, and non-GAAP cash tax rate to be approximately 10%, due primarily to U.S. tax acquirement to capitalize R&D and the full utilization of our U.S. net operating losses and tax credits in 2022. Fiscal year 2022 will be a 53-week here and include an additional week in the fourth quarter.

In closing, we had an excellent start to 2022, with strong revenue growth across all businesses. We are pleased to have completed the Xilinx's acquisition, which strengthens our business model with revenue diversification, accretive gross margin and increased cash generation. We are very delighted to welcome the Xilinx's team to AMD. Looking ahead, AMD is very well positioned for long-term growth, margin expansion, and cash generation driven by our leadership products and roadmaps.

With that, I will turn the call back over call back over to Laura, to begin the Q&A portion of our call. Laura?

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is now live.

Q - Matt Ramsay{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Thank you very much, everybody. Good afternoon. Congratulations, Lisa on obviously getting Xilinx closed and the strong results. I guess, there's a lot going on from a macro perspective in the markets that you serve and in the supply chains, Lisa. So, I mean in the first half of the year, I think you're doing, 54%, 55% organic growth in the first quarter. Maybe you could talk me through a bit, the puts and takes in the quarter. I think there's a perception that you have additional supply coming online, there's obviously supply constraints and lockdowns in China. Your server business is doing extraordinarily well and the numbers that you just printed. And then, maybe some perception of a softening in the PC market. So, there's a lot going on, and I'd kind of love you to walk me through the puts and takes of the quarter if you could? Thank you.

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So, we did have a very strong first quarter. There is a lot going on without a doubt in the business. I would say, if you look at the strength in our business in the first quarter, it was really broad-based. So very, very strong server results. We continue to gain share. We continue to bring more supply online. There, also a very strong results in our semi-custom or game console business, as well as in the client and graphics businesses.

There is some softness in the PC market. But we had for the last number of quarters actually been shifting our mix to the higher end or the more premium segments of the PC market, and so that's where more of our exposure is. And we actually saw a significant growth in our PC business sequentially, as we started ramping our Ryzen 6000 notebooks and that resulted in strong ASP growth, as well as just our key market segments of premium, commercial, and gaming are being covered there.

As we go forward, obviously, all of the things that you talked about are in play. That being the case, I think we've managed through the supply situations very well. We continue to work with our customers and ensure that we're optimizing our builds to their builds. And with the addition of Xilinx, we also have another set of end markets that have very strong demand that are all additive to do our business.

Q - Matt Ramsay{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you for that, Lisa. I appreciate all the color. I guess, as my follow-up question I wanted to examine the full-year guidance that you've given. Obviously, it includes Xilinx, so it's a little bit apples and oranges from last year. But I think in the press release, you guys mentioned that you expect some upside from the original 31% organic growth guidance. Do you have any comments on magnitudes there, that would be helpful?

And I think just, what investors would love to hear from you is, maybe your view on the data center CapEx spending environment? And also, on the PC market, I think, you guys have been, maybe a bit more conservative than some of your competition? And in your market commentary about PCs maybe being flattish coming into this year. I imagine there's some new puts and takes to that. So, just some thoughts on how you guys constructed the guidance for the year, especially relative to the original 31% would be really helpful. Thank you very much.

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes. So lots of questions in there, Matt, so let me try to go through them. So, first on the full year 2022 guide. It is a significant increase in guidance, up 60%. There are a couple of pieces to that. On the organic side of the AMD business, we originally guided up 31% based on what we saw in the market in January.

As we look at the market now, and our own sort of customer and supply situation, we see that organic growth higher into the mid-30s. That's primarily driven by very strong demand in our server business, very strong demand in our console or semi-custom business, additional supply coming online. We have taken a bit more of a conservative perspective on the PC market. Again, I think the softness is in certain parts of the market, it's not in all parts of the market. And our focus is on where we add the most value in the market and that is in the premium side.

In terms of the Xilinx piece of it, the full year edition of -- 3.5 quarters of Xilinx is a significant add on a pro forma basis. And the Xilinx business is also growing very well, and it's growing, sort of, like in the low-20s, if you consider full year compared to calendar year 2021. So overall, I think we have a lot of broad-based set of growth drivers and multiple levers for growth as we go through the year. And we continue to work on -- working with our customers on where the demand is and ensuring that we're satisfying that demand.

Q - Matt Ramsay{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Really appreciate the color, Lisa. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.

Q - Toshiya Hari{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Thank you for taking the question, and congrats on the strong results and completing the acquisition as well. I had two questions myself. I guess, first, on the supply chain situation, Lisa. Obviously, there's a lot going on in terms of wait for supply and substrates, and now the China lockdowns. What are some of the bigger pain points for you? And to the extent, the China lockdowns are impacting your business directly or indirectly? Are you assuming any impact to revenue and profitability in the second quarter?

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Sure, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. So, on the supply environment, we've been working on this really for the last 18 months. We've made a lot of progress on both the wafer side and significant investments on the substrates. I would say that we continue to get, sort of, very good support from our suppliers, that's one of the reasons we can increase our guidance, the way it is.

From an overall -- you mentioned the China COVID situation. From our standpoint, we haven't had any significant impact on our own shipments and our own supply chain. We have been working with some customers that have had some customer bill delays and that is contemplated in our second-quarter guidance. We're going to continue to work on supply optimization. With the addition of Xilinx, some of the, let's call, more mature nodes 16-nanometer and above water supply is still somewhat constrained. We're working with, sort of, the larger scale of AMD to try to bring more supply on board there, as well as continuing to ramp our overall capacity to support a very strong, sort of, in next few quarters.

Hopefully, that answered your supply questions.

Q - Toshiya Hari{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Yes, for sure. Thank you. And then my second question, my follow-up question was on the data center business. It's great to hear that, you're -- you've decided to re-segment your business, so thank you for that. Curious, how meaningful data center was as a percentage of revenue in the quarter? Server CPU, data center GPU, and now FPGA is from Xilinx.

And I guess more importantly, how are you thinking about the medium- to long-term opportunity in both your classic data center GPU business, as well as the FPGA business. I think, in data center GPU, you mentioned that it was flat in the quarter, but you also talked about being engaged with more cloud customers. So, curious, what you're seeing there? And then, on the FPGA side, I think Victor and team, prior to the deal announcement was pretty vocal about the long-term growth opportunity there as well. So, any update from your perspective would be great. Thank you.

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Right. Okay. So, again a few pieces to that. Let me try to give you some color and then maybe Victor will add on the FPGA side. So, in terms of, -- yes, we are going to change our segment reporting as Devinder said, as of the second quarter to be -- to give you two more alignments to the markets.

In terms of this quarter, for the pieces that you mentioned, on higher revenue, the data center for those pieces was, let's call, low-20s percentage of our overall revenue. And then, in terms of the longer-term data center picture, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity in data center. When you look at the pieces we have now, I mean, the CPU franchise is a very strong, continuing to get stronger. We're excited with how Genoa looks and how Bergamo looks and sort of the engagements with customers there.

We're excited about the GPU portfolio as well. GPUs for us are a longer-term, sort of, roadmap similar to what we did on the CPU side. We had been more focused on, let's call it, supercomputing and HPC. So that was strong for us last year and that's why we're flattish year-on-year. We're very engaged on the AI front now, continuing our investments in our software stack, and working with cloud guys to optimize our software stack.

And then moving on to FPGAs, and then also our Adaptive SoC's, and then the Pensando acquisition. I think what we now have is just an incredibly strong portfolio when we're dealing with, whether you're talking about the largest cloud hyperscalars or you're talking about enterprise. And then, with Pensando and Xilinx, it also gives us exposure to the edge as well. And so between -- we have all the compute engines and are able to optimize that. So, I think you should expect to hear a lot more from us in the data center, certainly, in -- at our Financial Analyst Day, but really strong opportunities there.

Maybe, Victor, you want to add on something.

A - Victor Peng{BIO 3844879 <GO>}
Yes, I think you covered well. The only thing I would add is, just again, I think not only do we have a really broad portfolio of all the compute engines, but we're doubling down on the networking side, right, since we had strength in that and SmartNIC and then with Pensando, the kind of solutions that we could provide to customers in the overall infrastructure, right? It's not about point things, it's about the total solution. And as you probably know, we scale out in just a lot of these applications you could be throttled by the network, so we really can optimize all this. And the customers really want to optimize, customize their solutions. And I think that's what we could do with both the former Xilinx, SmartNIC, as well as Pensando even going further.

Q - Toshiya Hari{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Thank you for all the details.

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now live.

Q - Vivek Arya{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, my first one is on the server market. You know Milan help you take and continues to help you take a lot of share in the market. I'm curious, what's the state of play in front of the next-gen Genoa versus the Sapphire Rapids server cycle from two perspectives. First, just from the industry adoption of DDR5? Can that be a bottleneck to adoption of these next-generation servers? And second perspective is that you will have two different flavors of Genoa with the cloud-optimized version coming later. So, just give us your sense of, how this next-generation cycle plays out versus the very strong success you had with Milan so far?

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely, Vivek. So, the way I think about it is the data center market and particularly in servers, people are getting much more optimized for workloads and so, there are different flavors. And we see that even in Milan today, with Milan and our -- with Milan-X, X3D sort of the -- the X3D we introduced. And so, I think it's natural for these solutions to sit side-by-side.

I think as you go into Genoa the next-generation platform, we would expect again, the adoption -- there's a lot of excitement on Genoa, and there's a lot of customer demand for Genoa. I do expect that Genoa will sit, again, side-by-side with Milan for quite some time, because you're not going to move the infrastructure instantaneously over.

And then, when you think about Bergamo, which is a cloud-optimized, I think, that will be more specific for specific large hyperscalars who have the need for, let's call it, a more performance per dollar, performance per watt solution. So, the way to think about this Vivek is, as our business has grown, we can invest more broadly, and that will give us just a more optimized solution for our customers' TAMs.

Q - Vivek Arya{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Very helpful. And then Lisa, my second question, kind of two or three interrelated question on the PC market. So, what is your new sense of what the PC TAM can be this year versus what you thought before? And then, I think, as part of that, your competitors are -- has mentioned several times that they are back in the market with Alder Lake and they are taking a lot of share. So, I'm wondering, what you have seen there?

And then finally, what's your share in the commercial market today versus what it was last year? So just something on TAM, competition, and commercial exposure. Thank you.

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Sure. So, Vivek, when we kind of started the year, we were thinking that the PC TAM could be flat too, let's call it, down, let's call it, low-mid-single digits. I think given, sort of, how we started this year and then some of the other things in the market, we're taking a more conservative approach to the PC TAM. So, for our modeling for the full-year guidance, we're modeling something like down high-single digits.

Now, a lot of things can happen between now and then. So, I would say that I think that's a good place for us to model. Within that, we've always been very focused on where we can add the most value and the premium segments, Ryzen 6000, our (Inaudible) product is extremely well-positioned from a battery life or performance standpoint. We have a number of commercial -- very good systems that are in the process of being launched, I think, we're excited about that.

To your question about commercial share. We're still underrepresented in the commercial market and we know that, and that's a focus area for us. I think overall from a market share standpoint, we believe we're focused in the right segments. And so even under the backdrop of, let's call it, a softer PC market that we will -- we can continue to expect to gain revenue share in the process. And that's sort of our overall strategy.

But I think the other piece of it is, we have so many levers in the business now, as we go forward. I think the strength in the business is really, looking at the overall data center portfolio, the PC portfolio, the gaming portfolio, and the Xilinx portfolio together, there are lots of levers for growth. And as we go through this year, we see that being a very, very helpful.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live.

Q - Stacy Rasgon{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I wanted to ask about data center. So, it more than doubled last year, and more than doubled again this quarter. You guys have the supply available to double that business again for the full year? Like, if you can get that -- and I guess if you get the supplies there like you think it can be fulfilled?

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes. So, Stacy, I think the data center business, particularly the server CPU business continues to be very strong for us. I'm not going to proclaim a certain -- will it double every quarter? I will say that we expect to grow very strongly over the next few quarters. And we are continuing to bring on additional supply to do that. The demand is there, and it really is about continuing to work with our customers on that. But I think our confidence level in data center growth is very high.

Q - Stacy Rasgon{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Thank you. And for my follow-up. I wanted to ask just a quick question on PC. So, in the context of a PC market TAM that you see down or modeling down high-single digits, given your mix shifts in your share gains, do you think you can actually glow -- grow your client revenues year-over-year in 2022, for the full year?

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes, Stacy. We are expecting that we will grow client revenues on a year-over-year basis in that time environment. And we continue to mix shift to, let's call it, the more premium segments. And so, it's a revenue share statement.

Q - Stacy Rasgon{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Got it. But fair to say, much more of the year-over-year revenue growth is things like servers and putting Xilinx aside for a minute, data center and servers and consoles more than client?

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes. That is true. But our expectation though is, can we have a number of growth drivers in the business. But the -- in terms of what has allowed us to increase the full-year guide from an organic standpoint, it is strong visibility in server, strong visibility on the console side, strong visibility just from an overall supply and demand perspective.

Q - Stacy Rasgon{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you so much.

Operator
Thank you. Next question is coming from Aaron Raikers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.

Q - Aaron Raikers
Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll stick to two if I can. I guess, my first question is, as we think about the server market and your share gains, but more importantly, we also think about the proliferation or expansion of the product portfolio. I'm curious, if just what you're seeing from a competitive perspective and your thoughts around continuing to mix higher in terms of the server market, thinking about the blended ASP trends in your server business? How should we think about that as we think about Milan-X, Genoa, I guess Bergamo thereafter, just that trend looking forward?

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes. So, Aaron, obviously, it depends on the mix between cloud and enterprise. But in general, as we offer more value, let's call it, more performance, more capability, we would expect our ASPs to mix up. And in any given quarter it's more of a, what is the cloud versus enterprise mix? But look, I'm very pleased with the fact that we're growing both cloud and enterprise very substantially. So I think that tells you that we're growing across the entire server market and we're going to continue to, let's call it, optimize products, so that, one, our customers get more capability and we get more value for our technology.

Q - Aaron Raikers
And then the second quick question is, on the capacity[ph] discussion. I'm curious, as you bring Xilinx into the model, you scale the business going forward. How could we think about flexibility from a perspective of capacity? If PC is slowed down, can your capacity be fungible and move that capacity over to servers or even Xilinx capacity into server CPUs? I'm just curious of how we should think about that ability to mix across product segments as you think about your wafer capacity agreements.

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes. Aaron, the way to think about that is, so both the Xilinx portfolio and sort of the organic AMD portfolio, do use PSMC. So, we are complementary there as our primary wafer supplier. We use very similar substrate suppliers as well. The Xilinx portfolio tends to be on more mature notes, although there is some seven-nanometer, the majority of the portfolio is on 16-nanometer and above. So, I would say there's not that much fungibility there. However, on the back and on the substrate side, there is very good fungibility across the portfolio.

And from the standpoint of overall supply, I think, you've heard it from Devinder. I mean, we have invested significantly over 12 to 18 months in, sort of, securing the supply and capacity, and we're seeing it come online. And that's, again, what I like to do is, as you see it come online, that's when it'll go into our revenue forecast. But I feel very good about the progress that we're making. And we're continued to dimension the company for just a much larger business. And so, it's a lot of supply that we're bringing online. We're working very much with Victor and his team as well because he has strong backlog and strong demand, and we're looking to use all of the AMD assets to also accelerate some of his builds.

Q - Aaron Raikers
Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live.

Q - Harlan Sur{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Good afternoon, and congratulations on the solid results, and closing the acquisition. Lisa, the team has done a great job of supporting all the major enterprise workloads on your latest generation EPYC and driving strong wins on the enterprise side with all of the OEM server guys out there. I'm just wondering, how much of the strength in the server business is being driven by this strong enterprise design win traction? And giving your pipeline of wins and orders, how big will Enterprise be as a percent of your server business, maybe exiting this year?

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes. So Harlan, thanks. So, we've made great progress on the cloud side. So we have strong adoption on internal, as well as external-facing workloads. We've also made strong progress on the Enterprise. I mean, as you said, all major OEMs have epic throughout the portfolio. And in this past quarter and in general, we've grown the Enterprise business about at the same pace as a cloud business. We're still cloud weighted, but I believe that it's going to be fairly balanced growth across both portfolios.

Q - Harlan Sur{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Perfect. And then maybe a question for you, or for victor. But when I think about the embedded markets, auto, industrial, aerospace, and defense, comm, infrastructure, consumer. Just given the strong market position here by Xilinx. I mean, they're in a good position to catalyze, EPYC attached to catalyze, Ryzen attached to their FPGA solution. So maybe, Victor can help us understand like, what percentage of Xilinx, FPGA solutions in the embedded market sits next to either an x86 or high-performance arm processor? Because I think that the processor opportunity in embedded is much larger than the FPGA opportunity. And I believe that embedded is a pretty small percentage of overall business for AMD. So pretty big opportunity, but wanted to get your views.

A - Victor Peng{BIO 3844879 <GO>}
Yes, maybe I'll take this one. I agree with you. Actually, one of the things that -- many things that's really exciting since we joined AMD is, we've done some customer visits and they're really excited about exactly that point. There's -- we have a broader portfolio and processors, and even in some areas GPUs, it's also great interest. The embedded business at AMD (Inaudible) been selling APUs and embedded versions of both the server as well as the client kind of products. And now with the FPGAs and Adaptive SoCs we have, we really can give a much more complete solution. And so, that is definitely on the menu of things in terms of revenue synergies, which we'll discuss more at the Financial Analyst Day. But yes, we're really excited about what we have, even in the existing products. And then, we're already working on our roadmap for creating more value going forward. So it's a great observation.

Q - Harlan Sur{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Great. Thank you.

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Thanks, Harlan.

Operator
Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live.

Q - Mark Lipacis{BIO 2380059 <GO>}
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, I think maybe an easier way for investors to his -- have thought about AMD historically, particularly more recently is, you've been successful in delivering server CPUs for data processing in the data center. And I think people or at least I have thought about Xilinx historically doing networking and communications solution for base stations as well as data centers, and they've kind of moved into this adaptive computing mode where they're doing more data processing also. And I wonder, you've seen other companies with general-purpose computing solutions, kind of add a communications capability. And I'm wondering, is there an opportunity for more data processing at the network edge, like, say at the base station where Xilinx has historically been really strong? And do you think the solutions, the architecture that you would have at the base station for the combination of data and communications network processing, do you think that ultimately -- it looks very similar to what you see deep in the hyperscale data centers, deep in the cloud?

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes. Sure, Mark. So, I think the answer is yes. And maybe, I'll generalize it a bit more. We're a big believer, I mean, the whole strategy behind AMD is to have the best sort of compute engines and then put them together in, sort of, in solutions for specific end-markets. So, I think our CPUs, GPUs, the FPGAs, the adaptive SoCs, and then the DPU that we're adding from Pensando give us just a tremendous range of capability.

So to your specific question and sort of comms infrastructure. I definitely think, there's a strong opportunity there. As Victor mentioned, we've been to a number of our joint large customers and there is absolute interest and I'm trying to put these solutions together.

And more broadly though, I think, what we see in terms of growth going forward? There will be more customization around solutions for large -- for these large customers, whether it's cloud customers, or large telcos, or even some edge opportunities. And having these compute engines will allow us to basically optimize those solutions together. So, we look forward to telling you sort of a lot more about, sort of, how we're thinking about these roadmaps as we go into our Financial Analyst Day in June.

Q - Mark Lipacis{BIO 2380059 <GO>}
And it's -- a follow-up, if I may? How -- as you develop those more customized solutions for your larger customers? How important is it to have a -- have your own software ecosystem versus to kind of pull everything together versus to kind of rely more on the open-source community or other players for that software layer to sit on top of that? That's all I had. Thank you.

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes, Mark. So the software is very, very important and software across all of those engines is important. And Xilinx comes with a very strong software stack. We have our own software stack. You'll see us unify that, and that will be an important part of our roadmap going forward. And to your open-source point. We do believe in open-source. We think collaboration is an important part of the ecosystem as well. So, all of those are things that we are working on to provide more complete solutions for our customers.

Q - Mark Lipacis{BIO 2380059 <GO>}
All right. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.

Q - Ross Seymore{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congrats on the strong quarter and closing the Xilinx deal. Lisa, just again, a lot of moving parts. You've said that a bunch of times, so forgive me if I dive into them a little bit. But as we think about your second quarter guide, I just wanted to get some of the moving parts that you're assuming there. So, if I take out the Xilinx side or just give you the full quarter of it and a little bit of guidance there. It looks like the core AMD is kind of growing low-single-digit sequentially. You've mentioned about the PC side, seeing some weakness, you've talked about that a bunch, and then the strength on the server and the semi-custom side. So any sort of color about the puts and takes to get you that organic growth?

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes. Sure, Ross. Thanks for the question. So for the second quarter in particular, the second quarter guide is driven by, sort of, one as the full quarter of the Xilinx business and strengthen our server business, primarily as we see in the second quarter. Now there are other puts and takes, I would call them on the smaller side of that. If you recall, I mean, if you think about whether you talk about the PC business or the gaming business, they tend to be more second-half weighted. So the second quarter doesn't tend to be a strong quarter for those businesses and so, that's not the driver of the sequential increase.

Q - Ross Seymore{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Perfect. And I guess a similar question, a perfect segue in your answer there. When I think about the full-year guide, obviously, incredibly impressive. You've talked about the organic increases. And it looks like, especially, with that extra week that you kind of going up low or mid-to high-single digits in one of those quarters and kind of flattish after that, just to get to the full year. So, similar sort of question. What are the puts and takes there? Is the PC seasonality something you're kind of leaning against a little bit relative to the high-single-digit drop you've talked about? Or you guys will still grow, but maybe not as fast as in years past, given that backdrop? Or is there something else that plateaus out in the second half?

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Not sure, that I see a "plateau", Ross. So, I wouldn't say that. What I would say though is, if I give you, sort of, puts and takes of the second half of the year. The -- again, we expect that the server business will continue to grow as we said, a good visibility there. We expect the console business to grow in the second half versus the first half also, that's typical seasonality.

Typical seasonality in PCs would also have the second half higher than the first half. I think we're modeling for a little bit sub-seasonal, just given sort of all the puts and takes in the market there. And then we expect the Xilinx business to also grow in the second half as more supply comes online, giving the strong demand. So, if you see all those pieces, I don't think there's a plateau. I think it's a continued improvement as we see one strong demand and also more supply coming online in the second half of the year.

Q - Ross Seymore{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Thanks for that. Apologies for the plateau word.

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
No one ever apologizes to me, so that's really nice, Ross.

A - Laura Graves{BIO 15126067 <GO>}
Operator, we'll take two more questions, please.

Operator
Certainly. Our next question is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live.

Q - Timothy Arcuri{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Thanks a lot. My first question is really around semi-custom. The rest of the business has been asked quite a bit. So, I guess my question on semi-custom is, Lisa, do you think that it can be a $4 billion business this year? It sounds like it can get pretty close, maybe even get there. And I guess also as part of that question. I think you were thinking next year would be an up year also for semi-custom, but given some of the consumer uncertainty, do you still think that it can be up next year? And then I had a second question. Thanks.

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes. Sure, Tim. So, without going into the exact numbers, I would say, the semi-custom business is a strong growth driver. We have -- we work with these customers very closely. We have good views of where they think the demand is. We're still in a place, if you were to look into the retail channel, you would say that the demand is underserved today in the semi-custom business. And there, the real build is towards holiday. So, the answer is, we do believe that semi-custom will be at a record for us this year. We have more content. We also have the Valve's Steam Deck that also has gotten very strong reviews and is ramping as we go into the second half of the year.

And then on 2023, I do believe that 2023 will be another strong year for semi-custom and would be up. And again, if you look at the history of these ramps, it's really around the fourth year that you see -- that you really see the business kind of hit its peak. In addition to that, just knowing some of the game releases that are from a software standpoint that are coming out, there are -- there's obviously, there's a good lineup there, but there's also an expected strong line-up as we go forward.

So yes, that's our current view of the semi-custom business.

Q - Timothy Arcuri{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Thanks a lot. And I guess just following up on the overall server market. I know that you're not the best read because you're gaining so much market share. But there have been some comments from some of the big cloud customers about," moderating or slowing investment" and there's some debate about does that mean that there's going to be some slowdown in procurement of servers?

So, if you strip out, your sort of share gain? I'm curious of your assessment of just overall strength in the data center market. Do you see it slowing at all later on this year or even into next year? Thanks.

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
I would say, Tim, we haven't seen that. We haven't seen that particular phenomena. What we do see is that there needs to be good planning. So good planning with our server customers and our large cloud customers, and we're doing that. And our planning extends beyond 2022, extends into 2023 as well. And from what we can see its robust demand.

Q - Timothy Arcuri{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Thank you so much.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brett Simpson from Arete Research. Your line is now live.

Q - Brett Simpson{BIO 3279126 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks very much. Lisa, I wanted to get your perspective on the AI silicon markets. And you've obviously focus on HPC with MI200s and you've got CPU roadmap on the server-side, that's a big host processor for AI. But can you share with us how we should think about AMD in the next sort of two, three years around -- it is like AI training, it is like inference, in particular, the GPU portfolio and MI300 et cetera. And when do you think this platform is really going to be able to sort of compete and win in the AI training and inference space? Thank you.

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes, absolutely. Let me start Brett, and then I'll ask, Victor, to also make some comments. No question, AI is a huge opportunity for us. And it's one where we're thinking about it very holistically in terms of how we address. So, on the server CPU side, a lot of inference is done on the server CPU side. We've been investing in that area on the GPU side for both training and inference. There a lot of is around the software stack and so, our focus is on optimizing our software stack with our large cloud customers and partners. And then what Xilinx brings to our portfolio is actually a lot of capability on the AI inference side, their current portfolio, and then additive to the AMD portfolio. So, I think you'll see much broader set of offerings from us in AI as we started talking about sort of the broader product roadmaps. And maybe, Victor you want to give some more?

A - Victor Peng{BIO 3844879 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, look, we've been -- we have this AI engine that is already deployed in production in a number of embedded applications and endpoints, and also edge devices like in cars, doing a lot of image recognition, all kinds of inference applications and that same architecture can be scaled and brought into the CPU product portfolio. And as we've alluded to that is exactly our plan.

We're also -- a moment ago there is a discussion about software, we're absolutely working on the unified overall software to enable the broad portfolio, but also, especially in AI. So, you'll hear more about that at the Financial Analyst Day, but we're definitely going to be lenient in AI, both inference and training. And I would say, end-to-end because we have endpoints, we have edge devices, both computing and embedded devices, and in the cloud and enterprise. So, we're very excited about that revenue synergy opportunity actually.

A - Laura Graves{BIO 15126067 <GO>}
Brett, did you have a follow-up?

Q - Brett Simpson{BIO 3279126 <GO>}
Great -- Yes, yes, thanks, Laura. Yes, just as a follow-up. In terms of AMD from a software monetization perspective, you -- we're also seeing a big changes in -- and the way you're addressing software. You're moving up the software stack to a high level of abstraction. Is this somewhere you think over the next two or three years, will you -- do you plan to charge for software? And can you share with us may be how we might think about AMD as a software business going forward? Thank you.

A - Lisa Su{BIO 5791223 <GO>}
Yes. I think, Brett, we have, maybe it's a broader conversation about our overall software strategy. But as Victor mentioned, the unified software capabilities around AI are very, very important. We also have with the acquisition of Pensando, they have a very strong software team and effort around their DPUs, and what we can do there. So, I think, as a total, you should see us investing a lot more in software. And then in terms the monetization and stuff, I think, we can address that more as we think about the overall solution space that we'll be offering across all of these compute engines. And again, much more -- great conversation that we can have as we come into our Financial Analyst Day in June.

A - Laura Graves{BIO 15126067 <GO>}
Thank you, Lisa. And as a reminder to everyone on the call, our Financial Analyst Day will be on Thursday, June, the 9th. We look forward to having you there. We'll also being webcast from our website. And thank you to everyone for your participation in today's earnings call.
