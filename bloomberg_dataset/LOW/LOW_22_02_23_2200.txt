Presentation
Operator
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Lowe's Companies Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference call. My name is Rob and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Kate Pearlman{BIO 22170345 <GO>}
Thank you and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Dave Denton, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward looking including our expectations for fiscal 2022. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings.

Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the Quarterly Earnings section of our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Marvin.

Marvin R. Ellison{BIO 7410703 <GO>}
Thank you, Kate, and good morning everyone. Our results once again to be beat expectations this quarter with comparable sales up 5% for the total company and 5.1% for the U.S., on top of over 28% growth last year. This result in comp sales of 34.5% for the total company and up 35.2% for the U.S. on a two-year basis. These results cap-off outstanding financial results for fiscal 2021 with sales of $96.3 billion, up 6.9% on a comparable basis and earnings per share of $12.04, up 36% on an adjusted basis.

With these outstanding results, 100% of our stores earned a quarterly winning together profit sharing bonus. This $94 million payout is $24 million above the target payment level and in recognition for their hard work throughout the pandemic in 2021, we are awarding an incremental discretionary bonus of $265 million to our frontline associates. Altogether, we were awarded our frontline associates with bonuses of over $350 million in the fourth quarter. As Joe will discuss later in the call financial support of our frontline associates is consistent with our commitment to being an employer of choice in the retail industry.

Our Total Home strategy continues to gain momentum as we grow our share of wallet with both Pro and DIY as they increasingly rely on Lowe's as a one-stop solution for all of their project needs. Looking at our results this quarter, I'm particularly encouraged that our growth was broad-based and balance across product categories, across both DIY and Pro both online and in-store.

In Pro, we delivered growth of 23% and 54% on a two-year basis. And we are building on our momentum with the Pro with the launch of our new Pro-loyalty program and MVPs, pro rewards and partnership program. We redesigned our loyalty program based on feedback from our pro-customers who express a desire for a business partnership rather than a series of standalone transactions. Our data shows that Pros who leverage our loyalty and credit offering spend 300% more than Pro's not engage in these programs.

Our Pro business is off to a strong start this year and we're excited about the national launch of our MVPs pro loyalty program. I look forward to providing updates on this critical initiative throughout the year.

Now turning to our DIY customer, where we delivered growth on top of exceptionally strong demand last year. Later in the call, Bill will discuss how we continue to grow our DIY market share by elevating our private brands, product assortments in our home-decor category.

On Lowe's.com, sales grew 11.5% on top of 121% growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, which represents a two-year comp of 147% and nearly 11% sales penetration. Our intuitive online shopping experience and expand it on-trend assortments are resonating with our customers. While we're pleased that our online sales have more than double over the past two years, we still have tremendous growth opportunity in front of us and as part of our efforts to enhance our omnichannel experience, we are expanding our same-day and next-day fulfillment capabilities.

With that in mind, we're actively piloting several gig network solutions including partnering with Instacart in several markets for same-day DIY home delivery and building on the success we gain in the Florida and Ohio Valley regions where our market delivery strategy, we completed the conversion of our third geographic area, the Carolina region during the fourth quarter.

As our reminder in the market-based delivery model, big and bulky products flow from our supply chain directly to customers' homes. This replaces the highly inefficient store delivery model where each store acts as its own distribution and transportation center for these products. As we continue to expand our market-based delivery model, we're freeing up space in our 10,000 square feet store backrooms which on average are considerably larger than our competition.

And we are testing out different options to drive both greater in-store fulfillment and expanded delivery alternatives for both Pro and DIY customers. In a few minutes, Bill will discuss our continued investments and online as we create a best-in-class integrated omnichannel shopping experience.

During the quarter, operating margin expanded approximately 115 basis points leading to diluted earnings per share of $1.78 which is a 34% increase as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior year.

These results reflect our disciplined focus on driving operating leverage through our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI as well as the ongoing benefits of our new pricing strategies. Joe and Dave will discuss these initiatives and further detail later in the call.

Turning to our results in Canada where performance lagged in U.S., the Canadian leadership team continues to drive productivity through proven technology and processes that have delivered great results in the U.S.

Before I close. I'd like to share my perspective on the home improvement market as well as our opportunity to continue to win share. Our outlook for the home improvement industry remains strong, supported by a very healthy consumer balance sheets, especially for homeowners and continuing home price appreciation, persistent solid demand for homes despite an uptick in interest rates is also expected to support residential investment. In fact, we're encouraged by the strengthening, millennial, household formation trends that will support home buying in the coming years.

Other trends remain favorable including baby boomers, increasing preference to age and place. With the extension of remote work for some employees, we are expecting a permanent step-up in repair and maintenance cycle and as a reminder, 50% of the homes in the U.S., are over 40-years old and will continue to require investments for up key and approximately two-thirds of Lowe's annual sales are generated from repair and maintenance activity.

Therefore, we're encouraged that the macro environment for home improvement remains very supportive. As we close the year, we continue to get back to the communities where we operate with total donations of $100 million in 2021 well-over our pre-pandemic levels. We're pleased that our efforts to enhance our brand reputation while supporting our sources and driving long-term value for our shareholders which recently recognized by Fortune Magazine as a name Lowe's the Number one most admired specialty retailer for the second year in a row. This is the first time in our history that we receive this recognition and back-to-back years. In closing, I'd like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to our frontline associates as I travel the country every week visiting stores, I continue to be struck by their commitment to supporting our communities while providing excellent customer service.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.

William P. Boltz{BIO 20688556 <GO>}
Thanks, Marvin, and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter US comparable sales increased 5.1% and 35.2% on a two-year basis. We delivered positive comps in all three merchandising divisions in the quarter with growth across Pro and DIY customers. Growth was well balanced with 12 of 15 merchandising departments comping positive and was broad-based on a two-year basis with all 15 departments up more than 18% in that timeframe. Beginning with our home-decor merchandising division, flooring and appliances delivered the strongest comps in the quarter. In flooring, vinyl flooring once again led the way as we continue to see consumer preference shifting towards this affordable and stylish solution.

Lowe's already offers a wide selection of vinyl flooring products including several Pergo, Wetprotect options. In this year, we look forward to extending our own trusted STAINMASTER brand with its high-performance characteristics and lifetime stain-resistant warranty across a full range of flooring products including laminate, tile and vinyl.

Within appliances, sales of ranges cooktops along with dishwashers were the strongest in the quarter. As we continue to extend our private brand offering, we recently launched Origin-21 across several product categories and home-decor. This is our new modern brand, designed for the trend-setting millennial consumer while our ever-popular Allen and Roth brand is tailored to the more traditional style.

Now turning to our performance in hardlines, the team delivered an exceptional holiday season. Customers were active early in shopped often in our (inaudible) category, which drove excellent sell-through in this holiday category. Seasonal, outdoor living, and lawn and garden delivered standout performances as customers continue to enhance their outdoor living spaces with new grills, patio heaters, fire pits as well as live goods for the yards in garden.

With the home serving as a center for entertainment, our customers are making the most of their homes inside and out. We continue to build on our number one position in outdoor power equipment with further share gains in battery outdoor power equipment as we drove over 37% growth in this area for the quarter and over 118% on a two-year basis. Both DIY and Pro customers enjoy the convenience, reliability and the power of our innovative battery powered products available in the EGO, Kobalt, Craftsman and SKIL brands.

In this spring, we are thrilled to expand our exclusive lineup of EGO battery products with their new 52-inch zero turn riding mower with features that include a fabricated deck and power to move up to 4 acres on a single charge. Also new for EGO, is the industry's most powerful handheld battery powered blower with power that will outperform the leading gas blower with 765 cubic feet per minute of blowing capacity.

These new products will complement our existing lineup and assortments from powerful brands such as John Deere, Honda, Husqvarna, Aaron's and Craftsman. This spring, we will launch our new Origin-21 patio collections as well as our new style selection replacement cushions. These cushions are made with a 100% recycled plastic bottles and there are fade-resistant, UV-protected as well as easy to clean.

Now turning to the Building Products division, our comps were very strong driven by broad based balanced growth across lumber, electrical, rough plumbing, millwork and building materials. We are pleased with the continued momentum we are building with the Pro as we work to expand our brand and product offerings to meet their project needs. In this year will be a full range of CertainTeed roofing, Insulation and Gypsum products. As a leading manufacturer of building products for both residential and commercial construction, CertainTeed is an important strategic partner that we are proud to add to Lowe's as we continue to enhance our Pro offering in the building materials category.

We also continue to build out our Pro power tool program with the introduction of the new, the Waltpower stack battery technology which is the smallest and most energy dense battery pack on the market. These new products and new brands for strong additions to our pro brand arsenal which already includes other great brands like Bosch, Eaton, Estwing, Fasten Master, FELX, GRK, ITW, lesko, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Matabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, Spacks, Spyder and Werner.

Moving to Lowe's.com, as Marvin mentioned, we delivered sales growth of 11.5% in the quarter and 147% on a two-year basis in the fourth quarter. We are focused on further enhancing our omnichannel capabilities in 2022 across three key areas expanding our online assortment, enhancing the user experience and improving fulfillment. First, we are expanding our lowes.com assortment to meet our customers' design and lifestyle needs. For example, within Lowe's livable home products, we will offer a range of products to help our customers adapt to their changing mobility needs. At the same time, we will continue to enhance the user experience with continued upgrades to the visualization and configuration tools like kitchen visualizer and measure your space.

Finally, as we continue to improve our fulfillment capabilities, our customers can now track their appliance delivery in realtime and we will soon be leveraging enhanced technology to further streamline the buy online, pickup in-store experience for our customers through an improved store execution process. As we look ahead to spring, we are well positioned to capitalize on what we expect to be another strong spring season. Consistent with our approach over the past year, we have worked hard to land our spring product early. Through an expansion of our network of coastal holding facilities, we are better able to manage the flow of imported product enabling us to quickly flow product where needed as spring arrives across the country.

As one of the largest importers in the U.S., we continue to leverage our scale and carrier-relationships to secure capacity and work to mitigate and manage the impact of cost increases across our supply chain. Before I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our merchants and inventory and supply chain teams along with our vendors for their hard work and continued support.

Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe.

Joel O. Cogdell
Thanks, Bill, and good morning everyone. I would like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for delivering tremendous results in 2021. In recognition of their outstanding efforts, we awarded to discretionary year-end bonus of $6,000 for assistant store managers, $1,000 for department supervisor, $800 for full-time hourly-associates and $400 for part-time hourly associates. As Marvin mentioned, the combination of winning together and this discretionary year-end bonus will result in a payout of over $350 million for our frontline associates this quarter.

As someone who started his career in home improvement as an hourly associates, I understand how meaningful this type of financial recognition is for our hourly-associates. At Lowe's, our people are truly our most valuable asset. When it comes to recruiting and retaining top-talent, we strive to be an employer of choice. From the moment that a candidate applies for position that Lowe's, we are committed to creating a positive impression. We have invested in leading technology that accelerates the hiring process, so that we are processing applications in a matter of minutes rather than the weeks that the manual process required as recently as last year.

We also continue to improve our on-boarding process, so that our new hires can quickly come up to speed, leveraging the technology and product knowledge that is readily available to them on their handheld mobile devices via the Lowe's University application. As I mentioned on our last call, we are also leveraging our new Lowe's University in-store training labs to provide the ongoing training that our associates need to build their skills and confidence, so they can continue to progress in their career.

Over the last three years, we have created valuable career opportunities for our associates with the incremental 10,000 department supervisor roles and a 1600 ASM positions that we have added since 2018. We have also invested well over $2 billion of incremental wage and equity programs for our frontline associates to ensure that we continue to offer a strong competitive wage and benefit package to our associates. I'm really pleased to report that our investments to position Lowe's as an employer of choice are paying off.

Heading in the spring, we anticipate to be even better positioned than last year from a hiring perspective and we are also confident that we will continue to drive productivity in our operations to our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives. As a reminder, this is not a single win, it is a series of improvements that are scaling across our stores over time. In fact, we are working on over 20 different PPI initiatives in our store operations this year. To highlight just a few key PPI initiatives, we have just launched a new store inventory management system or SIMS across all of our stores. This platform give store associates real-time visibility to inventory in their store. This includes inventory in the Home Bay location as well as product in the top stock and cap, off-shelf and back stock. This new system will eliminate the countless non-productive hours associates have been spending looking for product.

I'm also excited about our continuing efforts to eliminate the ancient green screen technology with the launch of our simplified user interface to other selling stations throughout the store. First introduced at our front-end registers, we are beginning to implement this new technology across the salesforce. With this new platform, we are accelerating the associate training process, and facilitated cross training and other departments. This new technology will free up our associates to focus on providing excellent customer service, while reducing customer wait time. While these two initiatives are just a few of the PPI deliverables plan for this year, we expect that these two initiatives alone will drive $100 million of productivity this year.

Looking forward, we will continue to leverage technology to reduce manual tasking for our associates, while also enabling them to deliver better service to our Pro and DIY customers. I would like to close once again by thanking our store associates for their continued hard work and dedication and the great results we achieved together this year.

With that I will turn it over to Dave.

David M. Denton{BIO 15990446 <GO>}
Thank you, Joe. I'll begin this morning with a few comments on the U.S. economy as it relates to the home improvement sector. As Marvin indicated the consumer backdrop remains favorable as we are confident that home improvement demand will remain strong despite an uptick in interest rates. Historically, when interest rates have risen against a strong economic backdrop, the home improvement sector has delivered solid growth. During these periods, housing affordability was supported by growth in jobs and personal income which offset the impact of higher borrowing costs. Today, housing affordability remains above the pre-pandemic average. The market is expecting moderately higher interest rates in the coming quarters. But keep in mind, rates are increasing off historic lows. Home equity has increased due to rising home prices and consumer savings are about $2.5 trillion higher than pre-pandemic levels positioning consumers for continued residential investments. Given all these factors, we are expecting another strong year of demand in the home improvement market.

Now let me turn to capital allocation. We remain committed to be best-in-class, when it comes to our ability to create value for our shareholders through our strong capital allocation program.

In 2021, we generated $8 billion in free cash flow driven by outstanding operating results and we returned $15.1 billion to our shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. During the fourth quarter we paid $551 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 16 million shares for $4 billion. This brought the total of $13.1 billion in share repurchases for the year ahead of our expectations of $12 billion. This reflected better than expected financial performance and our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures were $597 million in the quarter and nearly $1.9 billion for the full year as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives to both drive growth and enhance returns across the business.

Our balance sheet remains very healthy. Adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR stands at 1.98 times, well below our long-term leverage target of 2.75 times. As I mentioned at our December 15 Investor Update, we are planning to return to our leverage target over the next two years driven by our shareholder focused capital allocation strategy.

With that I'd like to turn to the income statement. In the fourth quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.78, an increase of 34% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share last year. This increase reflected better than expected sales growth, improved gross margin rate and favorable SG&A leverage driven by our productivity initiatives. In the quarter, sales were $21.3 billion, reflecting a comparable sales increase of 5%. Comparable average ticket increased 9.4% with higher ticket sales in appliances, flooring and seasonal and outdoor living and 90 basis points of commodity inflation in both lumber and copper. In the quarter, comp transaction count decreased 4.4%, but on a two-year basis comp transactions increased 8.9%. We continue to gain traction with our total home strategy as reflected in Pro growth of 23% and positive DIY comps on top of extremely strong DIY growth last year.

On lowes.com, sales increased 11.5% in the quarter. U.S. comp sales increased 5.1% in the fourth quarter and 35.2% on a two year basis. We saw acceleration in both our Pro and our DIY comp sales trends from our third quarter performance.

By month, our U.S. comparable sales were up 8.1% in November, up 7.4% in December and down 1.3% in January. Recall that we cycled over government stimulus in late December and early January of last year. But looking at U.S. comp growth on a two-year basis from from 2019 to 2021, November sales increased 33.8%, December increased 37.4% and January, increased 33.9%. Gross margin was 32.9% of sales in the fourth quarter up 115 basis points from last year. Margin rate increased 65 basis points driven by our disciplined pricing and cost management strategies.

Improvements in both shrink and credit revenue benefited gross margin by 50 basis points and 25 basis points respectively. These benefits were partially offset by roughly 30 basis points of pressure related to higher transportation and importation costs as well as the expansion of our supply chain network. I'd like to spend just a moment addressing the recent increase in lumber prices. We are confident that we have an effective strategy to carefully manage our inventory and rapidly adjust pricing. Although we are planning for our lumber margins to be compressed when prices decline, we are confident in our outlook for gross margin rate to be up slightly in 2022.

Turning to SG&A, we levered 15 basis points versus LY driven by higher sales in our relentless focus on productivity. This quarter, we incurred $50 million of COVID-related expenses as compared to $165 million of COVID-related expenses last year. This reduction in these expenses generated 60 basis points of SG&A leverage.

Additionally, we incurred a $150 million of expenses related to the U.S. stores reset in the fourth quarter of last year. As we did not incur any material expenses related to this project in '21, this generated approximately 75 basis points of SG&A leverage versus LY. These benefits were pressured by 100 basis points related to the discretionary year-end bonus of $215 million for our store base frontline associates. Operating profit was over $1.8 billion in the quarter, an increase of 21% versus LY.

Operating margin of 8.7% for the quarter increased 115 basis points over last year, largely driven by higher gross margin rate as well as favorable SG&A leverage. The effective tax rate was 25.3% in the quarter which is in line with prior year. At year-end, the inventory was $17.6 billion, up $920 million from Q3 and in-line with seasonal trends and consistent with our effort to land spring products earlier driven by both improved operating performance and a disciplined capital allocation strategy, we delivered return on invested capital of 35% for the year, up 760 basis points from 2020.

Now, turning to our 2022 financial outlook. We closed out 2021 ahead of the expectations that we presented at our December 15th Investor update. Month-to-date, February U.S. comparable sales trends our in-line with our fourth quarter performance on a two-year basis. And based on the continued momentum that we are seeing an Pro sales as well as higher expectations for commodity inflation, we are raising our sales outlook for 2022 to a range of between $97 billion to $99 billion for the year representing comparable sales of down 1% to up 1%. Now, please keep in mind that our outlook assumes that lumber pricing will return to a more normalized level in the second half of the year.

We continue to expect Pro to outpace DIY in 2022. Keep in mind that we are cycling over an estimated 300 basis points of stimulus in the first quarter. Also as a reminder, our 2022 sales outlook includes the 53rd week which equates to approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion in sales. We now expect gross margin rate in 2022 to be up slightly as compared to the prior year with higher projected sales improving gross margin outlook and continued execution of our PPI initiatives, we are raising our outlook for operating margin to a range of 12.8% to 13% from a prior range of 12.5% to 12.8% for the full year. We are also raising our outlook for diluted earnings per share to a range of $13.10 to $13.60 from a prior range of $12.25 to $13.

In 2022, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $12 billion. Finally, we are raising our outlook for return on invested capital to above 36% from our original outlook of approximately 35%. In closing, we are off to a great start in 2022. We have significant runway ahead of us to both grow our market share, expand operating margins and deliver meaningful long-term shareholder value.

And with that, we are now ready for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. We are now ready for questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Kate McShane{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. I wondered if you could maybe talk a little bit more about inflation? How you're viewing inflation as part of the comp sales guide for 2022?

A - William P. Boltz{BIO 20688556 <GO>}
Kate, good morning. Thank you for the question. As we think about next year and if you look at our guide of down one to up one, we would expect units to be modestly down in our average ticket offsetting that almost dollar for dollar.

Q - Kate McShane{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay, thank you. And based on what you said about February, it does seem like there may have been an acceleration from what you saw in January into February on a one-year, is it right that you're seeing better trends in February than January should really just be thinking about things on a two-year stack?

A - William P. Boltz{BIO 20688556 <GO>}
Kate, it is true. We are seeing better trends in February than January, but on a two-year basis, you need to think about it. Our trends in February consistent with the two-year trends for the fourth quarter, which is really solid.

Q - Kate McShane{BIO 7542899 <GO>}

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with DA Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Baker, your line is live for question.

Q - Michael Baker{BIO 4323774 <GO>}
Hi, thanks, sorry. On the Pro side, in the past you've talked about it as being anywhere between 22% and 25%, your orange competitor yesterday a bump there talk of what the Pro is 50%, they used to say somewhere of the what would just to mid '40s. I understand that it's hard to the exact number, but any update on what you think on an annual basis the Pro penetration is, and then more importantly, what do you think you can get to?

A - Marvin R. Ellison{BIO 7410703 <GO>}
Yeah, look, I think your first statement is directionally correct on what and where the penetration is? We just know that business continues to be very strong. If you think about 23% comp in the quarter and 54% on a two-year basis, I mean, we feel great about the business, and I think you know that we spent quite a bit of time on the last three plus years making not only investments in adding products to our assortment, but also our service levels fulfill and we're very pleased as I mentioned in my prepared comments with the launch of our new Pro loyalty program and as I mentioned as well, we're seeing a 300% increase in Pro sales for Pros engaged in our loyalty and credit program and so, Pro is going to be a significant part of our growth this year and we still feel very encouraged about progress.

Q - Michael Baker{BIO 4323774 <GO>}
Okay. And as a follow-up, DIY you said up, I was trying to get last year, it is fair to say up in the low-single digits slightly up, something in that range? Just what the math suggests.

A - Marvin R. Ellison{BIO 7410703 <GO>}
That's correct. We saw expansion in growth in both obviously the Pro but importantly the DIY as well.

Q - Michael Baker{BIO 4323774 <GO>}

Our next questions comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Simeon Gutman{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone. My first question is on EBIT margin. Now that it looks like you could get to 13% in '22. If you look at the model in the out years and I know you haven't really given anything past this. Is the correct way to think about moving past '13? It's productivity-driven, meaning it's all throughput and sales per foot keeps rising.

A - William P. Boltz{BIO 20688556 <GO>}
Yeah, I think that is correct. I mean, we're excited about in December to come back as a complete management team and really outline the building blocks for our progression above and beyond our 13% level as we think about our EBIT margins, but yes, I think about productivity is the main driver there as we continue to lean in to both the Pro business as well as a healthy-growth in our DIY business.

Q - Simeon Gutman{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Thanks. And my follow-up is on inventory. There is a big divergence in Q4 now between you and Home Depot and if we try adjusting to see if there is a catch up, it doesn't look like it's the case. And so I guess, Marvin when you got to Lowe's, I think it was the first and maybe even the second spring where you put Lowe's on the offensive. In terms of inventory. So the question for you is, are you pleased with what you've bought so far? And are you pleased with the visibility of what's coming in for this spring and even for the year?

A - Marvin R. Ellison{BIO 7410703 <GO>}
I'm sure it is, absolutely. I give a lot of credit to Bill on the merchant team. (inaudible) in the supply chain team for working in a very collaborative fashion to make sure that not only are we fully good about what we have from a product category, but also the quality of the inventory and as Dave mentioned in his prepared comments, the cultural holding facilities and we establish on both the East and in western coast have given us the ability to land in for product early take possession of it which on a temporary basis will elevate inventory levels, but we feel this a prudent thing to do to make sure that we have that product available out of that global supply chain., so we can get it to our DCs in our stores, but we do feel good about where we are. We feel good about the investments we've made in job lot quantities for the Pros and we think headed in the spring, which as you know, is a significant sales period we're in really good shape.

Q - Simeon Gutman{BIO 7528320 <GO>}

Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Scot Ciccarelli{BIO 1495823 <GO>}
Good morning, guys. Obviously, business is still exceptional, but what kind of impact are you projecting from higher interest rates on the housing market and what is your framework for those projections? Thanks.

A - David M. Denton{BIO 15990446 <GO>}
Yeah. Scot could my prepared remarks. we talked about interest rates do have an impact, to some degree, but if you go back into stores, they look at a period of time of interest rates have risen. At the same time, we had really good economic backdrop. Actually, the home improvement sector has benefited from that. And I think if you cycle into '22, you see that same kind of economic climate now, so we feel like the demand profile the sector is really healthy, number one; and number two, maybe the efforts that we're embarking upon and actually begin traction, we're going to actually disproportion take share in the marketplace. So we feel like we're really nicely-positioned to deliver a really solid '22 and think about the future growth of this business in a really healthy manner.

A - Marvin R. Ellison{BIO 7410703 <GO>}
Just one point to add, I do think that the improvement oftentimes get combined with home buying, a lot with the interest rates and obviously, the sectors are entirely different and I think to look at it historically as why I think Dave's comments are so important that historical trends will show convincingly that high interest rates combined with other positive macro indicators do not have a negative impact on improvement. Now home buying, I'm sure is a totally different equation, but we want to make sure that there is a lot of delineation between the two sectors.

Q - Scot Ciccarelli{BIO 1495823 <GO>}
Just to be clear, guys. At this point, there is no assumed degradation in sales trends because of higher interest rates?

A - David M. Denton{BIO 15990446 <GO>}
That's correct.

Q - Scot Ciccarelli{BIO 1495823 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Chris Horvers{BIO 7499419 <GO>}
Thanks, good morning everybody. Can you just delve into the factors a bit more about what's driving the increase in the comp outlook in 2022, so to what extent are you expecting a higher level of market growth versus what you laid out in December? To what extent are you assuming more share gains and then how does that compare to your expectations on price inflation and how lumber will play out?

A - David M. Denton{BIO 15990446 <GO>}
Yeah, I think there is really three things that are driving our increase in our guide from a topline perspective is one is, we do think the market is going to perform a bit better, and by the way, we still think we're going to belief and plan for us our piece in the market from a growth perspective. Secondly, we are seeing higher levels of commodity inflation and what we planned back in December, largely in lumber, so that is kicking our sales progression up slightly in the first half of the year. And then third, we're seeing really strong sustainable performance in our Pro business and that demand has been really consistent through Q4 and we're leaning into Q1 in a very consistent manner, in healthy manner from the Pro business perspective.

A - Marvin R. Ellison{BIO 7410703 <GO>}
Chris, I'm going to just add a little commentary on the Pro business. This is Marvin. If we did a pulse survey, you stated Pro that we issued out publicly, and this coupled with interesting data points when we talk to Pro and DIY customers, both said that they see you continue investments in the home. The DIY said at a people were 50% that they were going to do DIY project and the difficult since it even higher Pro. And then when you talk to our Pro customers and we have in detail, they continue to let us know their book of business is more robust than they've ever seen it. They have projects line they'll put amount of this year at some projects may carry over into '23 and help that is very strong. And I think all the investments that we made in our merchandise, assortments, in our service levels, in our stores in our supply chain is driving that business against two-year comp and 54% that's pretty good.

Q - Chris Horvers{BIO 7499419 <GO>}
Understood. And then can you also talk about the gross margin a little bit the shrink in the credit performance were quite strong and gross margin came in better than expected. How do these sort of proceed into 2022 and what's elevating your gross margin outlook relative to what you talked about in December.

Thank you.

A - William P. Boltz{BIO 20688556 <GO>}
Yeah. Listen, I think first and foremost, we're just extremely pleased of the performance from a shrink perspective, I think the store teams in the loss prevention team have just in an excellent job of managing that and now it's becoming a bit of a tailwind for us as opposed to a headwind which was historic. I think as we lean into '22 think about a few things happening. In general for the full year, we expect in the gross margin to be up slightly, product margin to really lead the charge there is we really manage price and cost very effectively. Our shrink in credit programs think about that is margin neutral for our performance versus '22 versus '21 and then we'll have a little bit of headwind as we think about both rates and supply chain in our continued build-out in the supply chain ecosystem.

Q - Chris Horvers{BIO 7499419 <GO>}
Thanks very much. Best of luck.

A - William P. Boltz{BIO 20688556 <GO>}

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Michael Lasser{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Marvin, I think you mentioned earlier today that about half of Lowe's sales growth in the second half of last year was due to product inflation and Home Depot mentioned yesterday, they got some 800 basis points of comp benefit from product inflation. At what point does the consumer start to push back or the industry experience in elastic response from all the inflation that being passed through, especially as there is a return to normalcy mobility increases and the interest in other categories shift on our (inaudible)? Thank you.

A - Marvin R. Ellison{BIO 7410703 <GO>}
Michael, look, I'll give you just a more philosophical perspective-based on the trends that we see. So, we are very confident that there are certain trends that will sustain. You have millennial household formation trends that are much more robust than any of us anticipated pre-pandemic. You're also seeing the investments in the home that will maintain simply because there are so many millions of people working from home permanently that even and we hope in (inaudible) the pandemic will dissipate. You still will have millions of people who will primarily work from home, that's going to drive certainly investments AND repair and maintenance that we think (inaudible) past 2022 and the work that the merchants and the financing has done to drive cost out and they will make sure that whatever price increases driven by inflation, we are pushing towards our customers, we're still doing that at a very competitive price because we're taking a more suitable actions to ensure that we're trying to drive other factors for cost out.

Look, you noticed, I think one of the only large retailers this reported this reporting an increase in gross margin for the quarter and for the year from a basis point standpoint and also regarding that important balance of '22, we're going to see gross margin rate continue to improve. That gives you an indication that we have some degree of confidence we can manage this. Holiday provide more the financial specific on kind of what we've seen and what we see going forward.

A - William P. Boltz{BIO 20688556 <GO>}
Yeah, Michael. I would just add that to Marvin comments here, we've really put in a very robust process and analytical tools around this such that we're measuring and monitoring as we take our increases from a cost perspective. First, we push back on that when appropriate, we take a portfolio approach to adjusting our pricing and then we measure and monitor the performance on a unit velocity perspective and we adjust as needed when we need to do that such that we get the best price point from a consumable-perspective, but importantly, what also drives the economic value here at Lowe's.

Q - Michael Lasser{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Thank you. My follow-up question is, Lowe's had some very interesting initiatives that are either in the early stages or just about the launch and most notably the supply chain transformation and the launch of the Pro loyalty program. So could you give a breakdown of the financial impact that you've seen from both of those programs as you've tested them and then what you factored in as far as the contribution from each of those in the year ahead.

A - David M. Denton{BIO 15990446 <GO>}
And so, maybe if the contribution, just from a planning perspective, these programs are well planned involve sought out. We have a substantial financial model associated with that. We test and learn as we go and so we feel like to our plan for 2022, we have a very good line of sight for performance being driven out of those two programs. So, first and foremost we will kind of checked that box and then I'll let Marvin chat about the program he'd like.

A - Marvin R. Ellison{BIO 7410703 <GO>}
No, look, I'll just repeat what I've said on the Pro. We tested a loyalty program all of 2021. We made different tweaks to it based on feedback and surveys from our Pro customers, we feel like we have a program that's going to drive differentiation and adoption. And as I mentioned, when customers engage in the Pro loyalty and our credit program, we're seeing that 300% increase in sales and we think that we're going to see some level of retention and engagement with our Pro customers. based on the will be happening within the next couple of years. So again, excited about the test and learn environment we've created and to Dave's point. I mean we put a lot of robust processes in place to ensure that we have good visibility to what we think each of these programs will deliver.

Q - Michael Lasser{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Fine. Best of luck.

Our next question is from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please do with your question.

Q - Steven Zaccone{BIO 22438684 <GO>}
Great, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the DIY side of the business. So, it sounds like most of the guidance raise is contemplated on the Pro and then commodity inflation, but can you comment if you're DIY outlook has changed in 2022 and then larger picture on DIY, there is a thesis will eventually see a give back of spending in the category, but it seems to still be accelerating as of late and it's still strong, what are you seeing in terms of purchase activity or project sizes from your customers that gives you confidence in the sustained strength in DIY?

A - Marvin R. Ellison{BIO 7410703 <GO>}
Thank for the question, our DIY sales were very, very strong in 2020. So, year-over-year, we had tough comparison. We were able to grow that business even on top of some really aggressive sales last year. One of the things that we're leaning into as part of our Total Home strategy private brands and private brand specifically in the core-related categories and I will Bill Boltz talk a little bit about what we're leaning in there and how we believe the (inaudible) give us some level of continued growth and differentiation.

A - William P. Boltz{BIO 20688556 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks, Marvin and just a little more color around the DIY business. I think as we head into spring, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we talked about a couple of key private brands will play a big role in the spring. It'll be origin 21 which we're excited about that. That's a new modern brand. So you'll see it introduced in patio, you'll see it in some of the core categories in our stores and then (inaudible) We worked really hard over the last 18 months to enhance that brand. So that's more of a traditional style and so that will play a big role as well and then, we're really excited about the expansion STAINMASTER, STAINMASTER as you know, we acquired a year ago was largely a carpet brand, but we have opportunities to use that in other categories in flooring, really building off of its kicked characteristics and then along the same lines as we look at, look into the spring season, our live good industry business is very strong has been I really nice run over the last couple of years and that plays a large role in our DIY business as we go into spring as well. So we're really optimistic around the DIY business we had in the first half of the year.

A - Marvin R. Ellison{BIO 7410703 <GO>}
Interesting, we're students of history and we know that one of the strategic mistakes historically at Lowe's was to over-compensate and over-penetrate in private brands in Pro-related categories. And so, Bill and his team have been very, very specific to continue to lean in to national brands on the Pro side. But on the DIY side specifically home-decor the customers are telling us, overwhelming (inaudible) our design capabilities of private brand. And so we going lean into that for differentiation and also for of a margin rate benefit and again, we think we're off to a great start.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Liz Suzuki{BIO 16142563 <GO>}
All right, thank you. How much market share do you think you've taken in the last three years and if the supply chain disruptions normalized in some of your smaller competitors are able to get product again, do you see some of those share gains moderating?

A - Marvin R. Ellison{BIO 7410703 <GO>}
Liz, it's a fair question, but I will repeat what I said a couple of different times. Home improvement, does not have great market share data that we can glean very specific answers to what I can tell you based on just our on the ground analysis is that we are-- if I take market share, it's hard to grow a business this size by over 35% on a two-year basis. And it's not coming from somebody. We also are aware that there are winners and losers in retail, based on the efficiency (inaudible) supply chain. We are fortunate that we are one of the largest importer of containers and we have great supplier relationships that the merchants continue roster, so do we believe that we're winning? We do. Do we think, we will continue to take market share in 2022 at stated earlier? Absolutely, we believe we will. And we think we'll take it across Pro and and the outline both in-store and online, but again talk we give the specificity comes data is not from that category.

A - William P. Boltz{BIO 20688556 <GO>}
Liz, from our internal data, we continue to-- our data suggests that we're performing 200 to 300 basis points ahead of the market pretty consistently and that would be our expectation going forward as well to outperform the market.

Q - Liz Suzuki{BIO 16142563 <GO>}
Great, thank you. And just, I mean, how much do you think that the expansion into home-decor and new product categories. Increases your total addressable market?

A - Marvin R. Ellison{BIO 7410703 <GO>}
It's a great question. We can only go by the feedback that we received from our customers when we do surveys and we do different types of focus groups and what they are telling us is that they are more brand-agnostic when it comes to home-decor-related categories in there are more concerned with quality of good stuff and price. Bill and his done with the launch of Origin 21 and will continue to improve and (inaudible) example, gives us a lot of confidence and we're really excited of our STAINMASTER as Bill mentioned, you're going to see it go into more hard surface floor, but we have some other really exciting ideas. We will be shared over the next couple of quarters, but we're going to extend this very, very recognizable in the high-quality brand in other home-decor categories the customers I think would be very excited about.

Q - Liz Suzuki{BIO 16142563 <GO>}
Great, thank you so much.

A - David M. Denton{BIO 15990446 <GO>}
Rob, we're going to take one more question, please.

Operator
Yes. The final question will be coming from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.

Q - Eric Bosshard{BIO 1647410 <GO>}
Good morning, two things if I could. First of all, the last two years have been relatively unique in terms of pricing and promotion and mix with a pretty aggressive consumer and Pro customer. As you think about '22 and it sounds like you think '22 kind of largely feels like the last couple of years, is your strategy the same with pricing, promotion and mix or do those efforts normalize a bit towards what we had seen historically?

A - David M. Denton{BIO 15990446 <GO>}
Yeah. Eric, I think there's going to be fairly consistent. Our plan is fairly consistent in '22 versus '21.

I'll let Bill comment a bit on that too.

A - William P. Boltz{BIO 20688556 <GO>}
Yeah. Eric, it's Bill. And so, you know, as you know over the last couple of years, we've been on this journey of getting into more of an everyday competitive price and trying to wind down what has historically been here a very high-low approach to marketing and promotion and we've very successfully been able to do that and that's now giving us the runway to continue to provide value in a number of different ways to our consumers, both through special buys, special values, unique offerings and so, that's the journey we're on and that's what we're excited about being able to get off of that with historically high-low approach allows us to be in this everyday competitive price in home improvement business and that's what we wanted to be on.

Q - Eric Bosshard{BIO 1647410 <GO>}
Okay. And then secondly, within the guide for 2022 which I think you spoke to negative units and price offsetting that to get to comp dollar growth. I haven't had a negative unit plan or outlook in quite some time for your business, I'm curious how you'd marry that up then with your inventory strategy and also with how you manage labor specifically in terms of the investment or the growth in both of those areas in a year where the outlook is reasonably for negative units?

A - Marvin R. Ellison{BIO 7410703 <GO>}
So I'll take the first part of that and will let Joel talk a bit about how our new labor system allows us to make real time adjustments by store by the Department based on ticket and transaction, you have to understand that one reasons why you're going to see negative units is because of the DIY customer in the heart of the pandemic made types of purchases if they're not going to make in a (inaudible) where there is less concern around the virus in less nesting at home. We had cleaning purchases that drove a lot of transaction, not a lot ticket. We had a lot of garden purchases and drove a lot of transactions, not allowed to take of people were home and they were seeing build. Categories like (inaudible) a lot of activity, not a lot of ticket. And so as we, as we normalize year-over-year, those activities are not sustainable. So when we see the ticket it is not as though, we believe that we see less customer traffic, we are just see DIY customers have different projects than they had when they were you can farms with their homes and staying busy with just random different projects around the house and that's the difference.

So when we look at we just been really transparent around how we view the inputs to West driving sales, we have no concerns that we are having a traffic issue or we have a customer demand issue, this is just more normalizing over unique activity in the middle of pandemic. So I'll let Joe talk about our labor system and how we can manage it based on all those inputs.

A - Joel O. Cogdell
Thanks, Marvin and Eric, you remember, just a few years ago we put together just a top-notch workforce management team and we developed a labor model that is activity based. So, labor model the served us well as sales that you've taken-off and exceeded expectations from an appropriate leverage standpoint and does the same in balancing out the ticket and transactions. So we're very pleased with our staffing and our outlook for '22.

Q - Eric Bosshard{BIO 1647410 <GO>}
Thank you.
