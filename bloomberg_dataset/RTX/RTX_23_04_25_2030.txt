With that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Hayes.

Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
All right. Thank you, Latif, and good morning, everyone. I trust everyone had a chance to see the press release. It was clearly a good start to the year for RTX and demand remains strong for both our commercial aerospace and our defense businesses. And I think importantly, we're seeing some stabilization in the supply chain.

Before we get to the highlights for the quarter, let me just spend a couple of minutes on the macro environment. Starting on the commercial side, domestic revenue passenger miles are now back to pre-pandemic levels, 2019 levels as we exit March. This was led by a very strong rebound in China following the zero-COVID policy reversal.

On the international front, we have seen continued improvement in RPMs, reaching nearly 80% of 2019 levels. With strong consumer demand and record advanced booking, we expect total global air traffic to fully recover to 2019 levels as we exit the year.

On the defense side, we're very encouraged by the present most recent fiscal year '24 budget request of $886 billion, that's up about 3%. And that's on top of last year's nearly 10% top-line budget increase. The proposed budget includes broad-based support for many of our key programs, technologies and capabilities, including a request to fund multiyear munitions purchases for AMRAAM. It also prioritizes HACM that's the hypersonic attack cruise missile as the future long-range hypersonic missile.

And perhaps most importantly for us, the budget reflects these decisions to move forward with the engine core upgrade for the F135 engine, which we believe is a win for both the warfighter and the taxpayer. This program will solidify Pratt & Whitney's position on the F135 and will provide additional thrust, range and efficiency necessary to support the needs of the warfighter well into the next decade.

Looking internationally, we're also seeing strong demand for defense capabilities as our allies prioritize additional defense spending. Poland recently announced plans to spend 4% of their GDP on defense this year, that's the highest level across all of the NATO countries. And we continue to support Ukraine's ongoing needs, including the (inaudible) accelerated deployment of the Patriot missile defense system, having another RTX capability to the Ukraine mission. Clearly, the demand environment remains strong across our end markets. And with that as a backdrop, let's turn to Slide 2 for the Q1 highlights.

Importantly, we exited the quarter with a record backlog of $180 billion, this included over $20 billion of new awards from some of our key franchises of the quarter. As an example, RMD received a $1.2 billion award for Patriot, for Switzerland, which marks the 18th Patriot Partner Nation. RIS was awarded $1.9 billion in classified awards. We also delivered solid financial performance was strong year-over-year organic sales growth of 10% and adjusted EPS of $1.22.

Regarding free cash flow, we started the year slowly due to some timings of higher working capital, which Neil will talk to you about in a bit. Importantly though, we remain confident in our full year outlook of about $4.8 billion of free cash flow. As expected, sales growth was led by commercial aerospace with aftermarket up close to 20% and OEM shipments up close to 17% year-over-year.

Additionally in the quarter, we achieved an incremental $50 million of gross merger cost synergies, and we are quickly approaching the $1.5 billion target with more opportunities still ahead. On the capital allocation front, we repurchased more than $560 million of our shares in the quarter and we remain on track for $3 billion of share repurchases for 2023. And as you saw yesterday, we increased our dividend over 7% from $0.55 to $0.59 a share in line with our commitment to return at least $20 billion to shareowners in the four years following the merger.

We've done all this while continuing to invest in R&D, additional capacity, automation and the digitization of our production facilities in order to support our growing backlog. As you can see, we're extremely well-positioned for growth this year and well into the future. Every day we are furthering our integration to unlock the scale and breadth of RTX, all while driving additional technology synergies and a focus on operational performance.

With that, let me turn it over to Mr. Calio to talk about the progress we're making in regard to our business realignment, and I'll be back at the end for wrap-up and Q&A. Chris?

Christopher Calio{BIO 20062802 <GO>}
Well, thank you, Greg, and good morning, everybody. I'm on Slide 3. As you know, we announced back in January, our plan to realign our portfolio into three business units. Collins Aerospace, Raytheon, and Pratt & Whitney. And as we said, this realignment has three primary objectives.

The first is to better align our market-leading franchises with our customer's priorities, ensuring more effective coordination and collaboration across our businesses. The second is to enhance our performance and capture additional synergies from both the product and technology standpoint. And third, to better leverage our resources to optimize our investments and cost structure.

So, let me update you on where we are on the process. After continued internal analysis and customer engagement, we determined the major content shifts within our portfolio necessary to achieve these objectives. First, the multi-domain command and control solutions of RIS in RMD will transition to the mission systems strategic business units within Collins. So create a more focused business to support connected battlespace opportunities.

Additionally, RIS is air traffic management business will be integrated in Collins' connected aviation solution strategic business unit, further consolidating what we call the connected ecosystem of flight data and management into one business. These two moves or put Collins at the center of our company-wide collaboration efforts, they will now be responsible for more than half of our revenue synergy projects.

In parallel, we will move Collins' intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance business to the new Raytheon business unit, combining complementary sensing and imaging technologies to improve our offerings for multiple customer applications.

And lastly, the new Raytheon business will merge the remaining RIS in RMD businesses into strategic business units, aligned around specific customers such as the Air Force, Army, Navy Space and Missile Defense. When this is complete, the top customer of each of these strategic business units will account for 70% or more of that business unit sales.

In addition, we will establish a strategic business unit that will operate like a merchant supplier within the Raytheon business unit. We'll centralize components and sub-systems that are sold internally, as well as to a broad array of government, commercial and other prime customers enabling us to sell more effectively into these channels.

As part of this realignment, we're pleased to announce that the new Raytheon business unit will be led by Wes Kremer, currently the President of RMD. Wes has over 20 years of experience across multiple businesses and product lines within Raytheon, he is uniquely qualified to lead this business.

We are now in the middle of the implementation phase, including our analysis and validation of targeted gross cost savings. We provide more details on the new design and the implementation status, including those savings at our Investor Meeting at the Paris Air Show. So overall, good progress thus far as we remain focused on our goal to operate under the new structure beginning in July.

With that, let's move to Slide 4, and I'll provide an update on the current environment. In general, now a lot has changed since we spoke back in January and demand remains strong across our end markets. On the defense side, as Greg mentioned upfront, some of the awards we received in the quarter and are a record backlog. On the commercial side, with a strong aftermarket growth in the quarter as airlines are preparing to support the busy summer travel season. But air traffic increasing and retirements remaining very low, we continue to see strength in parts, repair, provisioning and maintenance across our end-markets.

Given this demand, our focus remains on ensuring we have the capacity, supply chain performance and operational excellence necessary to meet our commitments to customers. So let me start and provide some color on capacity.

At RMD, we continue to invest in new test equipment, tooling and automation at our Tucson, Andover in Huntsville facilities to support the ramp-up on key programs such as AMRAAM, StormBreaker, SM-3, SM-6 and Patriot GEM-T. At Pratt Asheville North Carolina turbine airfoil site, we now have 63% of machining production assets onsite and are progressing towards first article inspection by the end of May on our way to improving productivity and cost in support of the high volume GTF and F135 programs.

While in Tucson, we recently completed a classified space conversion, bringing our total number of classified seats added over the past two years, almost 1000 with the expectation of an additional 900 more by the end of '23. This will create the classified lab capacity for RMD to execute on recent development wins such as HACM, HALO, and NGI.

Furthermore, we are expanding our MRO network. This past quarter, two new facilities joined the GTF aftermarket network. The second MRO shop in Japan and 155,000 square foot shop at Delta Airlines TechOps in Atlanta. We of course also remain very focused on the health of the supply chain, which continues to be a challenge from a performance and cost perspective.

Starting with performance. While we've experienced stabilization in certain areas such as electronics, continue to experience challenges in castings, forgings, raw materials and machining. You've heard us talk before about our in-person support embedded our supplier sites and that continues to increase. Today, we are present in more than 400 suppliers with a focus on high-impact locations.

In specific to defense, we have significantly increased onsite support in the last quarter, allowing us to help clear bottlenecks, better execute engineering and quality initiatives, to provide improved overall visibility. And at RMD, this help yield a 5% improvement in material receipts year-over-year, enabling increased flow through our factories.

Additionally, we held an RTX Supplier Conference just a few weeks ago where we engaged with about 70 key suppliers during detailed action plans to ensure future capacity and to reduce current overdue positions. On the cost side, the overall inflation picture remains persistently high and we are tackling those inflationary pressures from several angles. We were almost 2,000 cost-reduction projects ongoing related to our supply chain with product and non-product including negotiating better contractual terms, transitioning work to lower cost sources and part redesigns to reduce cost.

We are also going deeper into our supply chain to better understand their usage of constrained raw materials such as aluminum, titanium and nickel. So we can get a complete picture of our embedded spend and to leverage total raw material purchases, drive improved cost positions, and secure supply throughout our value stream.

And lastly, we continue to leverage our core operating system to execute on our cost reduction initiatives, as well as footprint modernization. As we've previously talked about, we have thousands of ongoing projects, many of which are at the manufacturing line or cell level to take cost out of our operations. These range from things like redesigning material and machining flow to reduce labor hours and cycle time. It's implementing closed-door machining to enable the completion of a part in one continuous process without any operator intervention. But these are relatively small initiatives with short paybacks. They are part of a continuous commitment to improvement in efficiency.

So before I turn it over to Neil to recap the financials, I do want to provide a brief update on the GTF program. As you know, since the GTF program went into service in 2015, We've continued to introduce upgrades and improvements to increase reliability and durability. Respect to reliability, we have met the target level for dispatch reliability. This is now a mature engine levels.

Let's take the durability. We have improved time-on-wing since program inception. Again time-on-wing meaning how long engines can be operated before needing to be removed for maintenance. But we are not yet at the -- at the level, we and our customers expect. This has put stress on the operations of the fleet. We continue to develop upgrades to the current GTF configuration to improve durability. We're also expanding our MRL capacity in working to reduce shop visit turnaround time to improve service availability.

It will take some time to realize these benefits. We are continuing to invest in time-on-wing improvements as we were able to do over the course of the V2500 program. And of course, in parallel, we continue to execute on our GTF Advantage development program, our next-generation GTF configuration. We will incorporate all of our experiences in technical earnings since entry into service.

Okay. With that, let me turn it over to Neil to walk through our financial results.

Neil G. Mitchill{BIO 18320109 <GO>}
Thank you, Chris. I'm on Slide 5. As Greg noted, sales of $17.2 billion were up a strong 10% organically versus the prior year. This growth was driven by both commercial aerospace and defense, despite some of the environmental challenges we continue to face. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 was up 6% year-over-year with strong segment operating profit growth of 15%, partially offset by the expected lower pension income and a higher effective tax rate.

On a GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.97 per share and included $0.25 of acquisition accounting adjustments, restructuring, and non-recurring items.

And finally, free cash flow was an outflow of $1.4 billion in the first quarter, which is historically our lightest quarter of the year due to the timing of incentive compensation payments, and seasonality in our defense businesses.

In addition to these typical dynamics, the timing of sales and cash collections, as well as supply chain and capacity constraints drove higher working capital in the first quarter of this year. We expect to generate positive free cash flow beginning in the second quarter as commercial deliveries accelerate and performance, as well as other funding milestones are achieved. And importantly, as Greg said, we remain confident in delivering about $4.8 billion in free cash flow for the full year.

So with that, let's turn to Slide 6 and get into the segment results. Beginning with Collins, sales were $5.6 billion in the quarter, up 16% on an adjusted basis and up 17% on an organic basis, driven primarily by the continued recovery in commercial aerospace end markets, resulting in higher flight hours and higher OE production rates. By channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 24% on an adjusted basis and 26% organically, driven by a 43% increase in provisioning and a 29% increase in parts and repair, while modifications and upgrades were up 1% organically in the quarter.

Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 8%. Commercial OE sales were up 12% versus the prior year, driven by production ramps in narrow-body business jets and wide-body. And military sales were up 9% due to both higher material receipts and manufacturing throughput. Adjusted operating profit of $800 million was up $216 million from the prior year, with drop through on higher volume and favorable mix, partially offset by higher production costs and higher SG&A expense. Looking ahead on a full-year basis, we continue to expect Collins' sales to grow low-double-digits and operating profit of between $750 million and $825 million increase versus 2022.

Turning to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 7. Sales of $5.2 billion were up 15% on an adjusted basis, and 16% on an organic basis with sales growing across all segments. Commercial OE sales were up 27% in the quarter on higher engine deliveries within both Pratt's large commercial engine and Canada businesses. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 14% in the quarter, primarily driven by increased volume and a favorable mix. And then the military business, sales were up 13%, driven by the F135 production contract award in the second quarter of last year, and higher F135 sustainment volume. Adjusted operating profit of $434 million was up $126 million from the prior year, driven primarily by drop through on higher commercial aftermarket, favorable contract matter and higher military sales, which was partially offset by conversion on higher commercial OE volume. Turning to perhaps the full-year outlook, we continue to expect sales to grow low to mid-teens and operating profit growth of $200 million to $275 million versus 2022.

Shifting to our RI&S on Slide 8. Sales of $3.6 billion were in-line with our expectations and flat versus prior year, both on an adjusted and organic basis. This was driven by lower command, control and communications programs, which was mostly offset by higher revenue from Cyber and Services programs. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter of $330 million was down $48 million versus prior year, driven primarily by lower net program efficiencies spread across several programs. RIS began the year with strong orders in the quarter of $4.3 billion resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.34 and a backlog of over $17 billion. This brings our RIS's four-quarter book-to-bill to 1.09.

In addition to the significant bookings Greg mentioned earlier, RIS also received $650 million award for the Next Generation Jammer and a $275 million Space Development Agency award for missile tracking satellite constellation. Looking ahead, we continue to expect our RI&S' full year sales to be flat with operating profit growth of $75 million to $125 million versus 2022.

Turning now to Slide 9, RMD sales were $3.7 billion, up 4% on an adjusted basis and up 5% organically, primarily driven by higher sales in advanced technology and air power programs. Adjusted operating profit of $335 million was down $52 million versus the prior year, driven by the lower -- by lower net program efficiencies and higher development program mix, partially offset by higher volume. Lower net program efficiencies included the unfavorable impact of a significant option exercise in the quarter, which had about 100 basis point impact on the margin.

Like RI&S, RMB's bookings were also very strong to start the year with $5.2 billion of bookings in the quarter, including over $600 million by six-award. This resulted in a record backlog of $35 billion and a book-to-bill of 1.43 in both the quarter, as well as on a rolling four-quarter basis. And for the full year, we continue to expect RMD sales to grow low to mid single digits with operating profit growth of between $175 million and $225 million versus 2022.

With that, I'll turn it back to Greg to wrap things up.

Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
Okay. Excuse me. Thank you, Neil. I'm on Slide 10. Just a couple of thoughts before we open it up for Q&A. I think first and foremost, given the strength of our backlog and the continued end-market demand, we as a team remain extremely confident we can deliver our '23 guidance and our 2025 commitments. Our success, of course begins with ensuring that we're meeting our customers' most critical needs. We're keeping a watchful eye on external factors and I would tell you that Chris and the entire senior leadership team remain laser-focused on mitigating supply chain constraints and driving productivity and efficiency improvements across all of the businesses.

More importantly, we're continuing to invest in innovative solutions and differentiated technology that will continue to drive long-term growth. Last thought is, earlier this month marked the third anniversary of the merger. We've been able to accomplish a lot so far, even with this challenging environment. And we know there's a lot more progress we can make with the ongoing business realignment, which will set up RTX for success or decades to come. We look forward to sharing more of this information on our transformational efforts in our long-range outlook during our Investor Day at the Paris Air Show on June 19th.

With that, let me open up the call for Q&A. Latif?

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Wolfe Research. Your question, Myles.

Q - Myles Walton{BIO 6802513 <GO>}
Thanks, good morning.

A - Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
Good morning, Myles.

Q - Myles Walton{BIO 6802513 <GO>}
Hey, Greg or maybe, Chris. I don't know which but on RMD. Obviously, this has been one where you're sort of trying to get to the bottom of the issues, and it sounded like it was a contract option exercise was 100 basis points. But even with that, you obviously have an implied 12.5% margin for the rest of the year in the guidance. So I'm just curious, what's driving that, how profitable is the backlog growth it's now built up? I think that's one of the questions that everybody has and I know after realignment, RMD won't exist, but it will still be part of the business obviously.

A - Christopher Calio{BIO 20062802 <GO>}
Yeah. Hey, Myles. This is Chris. Thanks for the question. Look, agree. We'd like to be seeing the margins improving at a bit of a faster rate. But there are some real positives in this business when you step back, most notably the backlog. If you think about the book-to-bill over the last 12 months, it's a 1.43, which is really phenomenal, but some key wins and some potential franchise areas.

You'll notice remarks. We did have a contract option exercise in the first quarter. It's good business, it makes no mistake about that. But because of the accounting resulted in a bit of a negative impact about 100 basis points. If you exclude that, it would put RMD at a bit over 10% sort of in-line with where we were in Q4. As you sort of look ahead to the RMD margin profile, the two principal drivers of that margin improvement are going to be material flow and flow in our factory. And of course, just absorption brought on by higher material receipts and of course, the labor that goes with it.

So if you think about the factory flow, we had 15% increase in Q4 in terms of material receipts and other 5% here in Q1 and we're starting to see the results in the factory. You heard, Greg talk prior about kit fill rates being in the 50s, the material flow that we've seen lately as profit kit fill rate up into the low-70s. Our historical rate is in more than the mid-80s. But as we continue to drive more material, you'll see more material flow in the factories getting those kit fill rates up and that's going to reduce the period of performance.

And then again, the second one, again it's just math, with increasing material volume and labor, we're going to see better absorption of our fixed indirect support costs. So more productivity there. So that's the margin profile sort of profile and story at RMD.

Q - Myles Walton{BIO 6802513 <GO>}
Okay, and is it particularly back-end loaded to the year of the management's second half?

A - Neil G. Mitchill{BIO 18320109 <GO>}
Myles, this is Neil. Yeah. I expect that to accelerate as the year goes on. But I would point to the second half, as Chris said, with the kit fill rate in the 70s as that grows into the 80s and then higher as the year progresses, you'll see the productivity, the confidence around our ability to shorten that period of performance improve and that will show up in the EACs.

The other thing I'll say is that option we had. Again as Chris said, good business. There may be another one. But again, this is really good business coming on the heels of increased customer demand. So, we'll be sure to continue to talk about that.

But I think the fundamentals of the backlog are strong as we look at the margin embedded in that backlog, it's above 10% and that gives us the confidence that margin expansion will come over time.

Q - Myles Walton{BIO 6802513 <GO>}
Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Your question, Noah.

Q - Noah Poponak{BIO 16071528 <GO>}
Hey, good morning, everybody.

A - Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
Hey. Good morning, Noah.

Q - Noah Poponak{BIO 16071528 <GO>}
Can we just spend a little bit more time on the Pratt margin, and I guess what's happening with pricing in the aftermarket, maybe specifically in the engine? Just sounds like out there in the industry given limited part supply, limited MRO availability that pricing is maybe much better than normal. So, curious what you're seeing on that front, especially, the things that are not on some version of a long-term agreement. And what does that mean for the Pratt margin going forward?

A - Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
No, let me start. It's Greg. First of all, on the pricing side with all of the inflation that we've seen over the last 18 months. I would say, Pratt and Collins were both relatively aggressive last year in catalog price increases. And so I think, we are seeing some of the benefits of that, that aftermarket part increase.

But keep in mind on GTF, for instance, more than 75% of all of those customers are on long-term support agreements. So, you really aren't seeing the benefit of pricing there. Similarly, the OEM contracts. Again, we have some benefits of pricing, but it is very limited based upon the indices. Obviously, there's a (inaudible) there. So we're not getting, I would say a lot of pricing power today, sort to say that we won't improve as time-on-wing, as Chris was talking about improves, margins will improve. But pricing is not the driver of this. This is really demand-driven, it's what's driving top line here.

A - Neil G. Mitchill{BIO 18320109 <GO>}
Maybe I'll just add about the margin profile, Pratt. Obviously, as we look at the rest of the year, Noah, we expect the engine deliveries to increase. Think about between 35% and 40% year-over-year, you saw a 42% in the first quarter, that will obviously come with some negative engine margin headwind. I would put a number around $250 million in terms of rest of year, any headwind that would then be coupled with the strong aftermarket that we're expecting to continue at Pratt. You'll see that margin sort of level out as the year goes on and those engine deliveries increase.

Q - Noah Poponak{BIO 16071528 <GO>}
Okay, thanks very much. I appreciate it.

A - Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
Thanks, Noah.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stallard of Vertical Research. Your question, Rob?

Q - Robert Stallard{BIO 3939416 <GO>}
Thanks so much. Good morning.

A - Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
Good morning, Rob.

Q - Robert Stallard{BIO 3939416 <GO>}
Maybe just a follow up, as you on know this question with regards to Pratt. 14% aftermarket growth year-on-year in the quarter, given the aggressive price increase that Greg referred to, feels a bit low.

And then secondly on those GTF volumes, how do those compare versus Airbus's A320 ramp plan? Thank you very much.

A - Neil G. Mitchill{BIO 18320109 <GO>}
Okay, so let me start on the aftermarket. 14%, Pratt & Whitney consolidated level aftermarket growth on top of 37% a year ago. So, when I think about that, it's still very strong growth. We have seen shop visits increased low-double digits here in the first quarter and we expect that to continue as the rest of the year continues, Rob.

I would tell you that the legacy engines remain very strong. Even the PW2000 and 4000s on the V2500 the shop visits continue. They are paced by some of the structural casting issues that we've talked about. So I think as we've seen improvement there and I'll let Chris talk about that in a minute.

We do expect to see accelerated growth in terms of the Pratt & Whitney aftermarket. On a full-year basis, we still think Pratt's aftermarket will be up 20% to 25% year-over-year. So, nothing concerning in the first quarter results, as you know, incredible demand as we look at the rest of the year for the flying fleets of the Pratt engines.

A - Christopher Calio{BIO 20062802 <GO>}
Hey, Rob. This is Chris. Maybe to comment on the OE deliveries. Greg mentioned, stabilization in the supply chain. I would say on structural castings, we continue to see some improvement and that's obviously critical for Pratt. If you think about the key constraint castings at Pratt, they are about 30% sequentially this quarter. Now that's not to the level of flow that we need. We continue to see some manpower, sort of labor challenges in that supply chain and we're taking some actions to try to address that whether it be offload, whether it'd be helping to improve yields in the manufacturing process. But we are lockstep with Airbus on their demand for the year and we are hand the mouth right now, given some of the -- given some of the constraints. But again, lockstep with the demand and that will continue to increase as we move into the back half of the year.

A - Neil G. Mitchill{BIO 18320109 <GO>}
Chris, maybe just to add on to that a little bit. The key constrained structural castings that 30% is a sequential improvement and the number of castings that we've been able to get in the first quarter. So, continue to have the challenges, but good sign as we gain momentum starting the year, right?

Q - Robert Stallard{BIO 3939416 <GO>}
That's great. Thanks so much.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Akers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Matt.

Q - Matt Akers{BIO 22271349 <GO>}
Yeah. Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wonder if you could touch a little bit more on working capital. I mean, a little bit of a bigger impact than we've seen in Q1 prior year is it kind of spread across contract assets to receivables, inventories that you know anything that's kind of drove that this quarter?

A - Neil G. Mitchill{BIO 18320109 <GO>}
Sure. Thanks, Matt. You know, certainly working capital was a drag on the quarter. I would say about, we typically see breakeven-ish type cash flow. We are expecting probably a slight outflow. It's obviously a little bit worse than that. About $500 million of that, I would characterize as an inventory build. The silver lining here is that with the easing of the supply chain constraints, we've seen an incredible amount of inventory come in.

We're also looking to balance that and make adjustments in our MRP as we look at the rest of the year. But about I'd cost $500 million of the excess there associated with the inventory build. We increased our inventory $700 million. So we plan to grow our inventory and it's sort of good news, situation grew a little bit further. I fully expect that to turn the other way as we go through the rest of the year.

On the contract asset side, that really was in our defense businesses. Again, the seasonality of those businesses is that we invest in, the products we ship them. And then we make milestone collections as we meet performance milestones. I expect those performance milestones to be met as we go through the rest of the year. So, again, slightly higher than we had planned, we did get those billings out in early April and they've already been collected. So, I'm not concerned about that.

Then the last piece we saw in terms of the first quarter was a slight increase in our receivables, probably about a couple of $100 million. And frankly, that's due to the timing of sales. So, they came a little bit later in March. We'll collect that here in the second quarter.

So, as we look at the rest of the year and I think about getting from the outflow of $1.4 billion, up to our objective of $4.8 billion or so. Here's how I would characterize that walk. The majority of that's going to come from profit that we've yet to realize. So, nearly $5.5 billion, $6 billion there. We expect working capital to be flat year-over-year. So, we'll have an improvement of about $2.7 billion, about half of which will come from the inventory. We've got some puts and takes, a few hundred million dollars net of taxes and pension. And then, of course, a little under $2 billion of capital CapEx left to go in the year. And if you do all that math, you get to about $4.8 billion.

If you look at the fourth quarter of last year, I think we generated about $2.2 billion of cash. So, I do expect it to be back-ended. But turning cash positive in the second quarter, pretty consistent with what we saw last year, which was in the $750 million range and that's after absorbing about $650 million of incremental cash taxes that will pay here in the second quarter because of the R&D impact.

So, we feel confident in the full year. Obviously, a lot to do, but it's nice to have the inventory, given the strength of the demand that we're all seeing here in the business.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Your question please, Sheila.

Q - Sheila Kahyaoglu{BIO 17240338 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning, Greg, Chris, and Neil.

A - Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
Good morning, Sheila.

Q - Sheila Kahyaoglu{BIO 17240338 <GO>}
Neil, since you're so good with the numbers and you keep giving us detail. I want to ask another one on Pratt performance. What drove the strength in the quarter of 8.3% margins versus the 6% implied for '23 and sort of what drives the lower margins for the year and how do we think about the aftermarket drop-through, given some of the prior commentary on GTF aftermarket and how do we think about the PwC and military mix as well.

A - Neil G. Mitchill{BIO 18320109 <GO>}
More questions, let me see if I could remember them all. here we go. So, in the first quarter, as I think about the 8.3% margin for Pratt, there are really two things that I would point to. Clearly, we had the drop-through from the aftermarket growth. So you have that. We also had a favorable contract matter settled. That was about $50 million or $60 million. So that won't repeat. But it was good news.

And we also had -- We had a year-over-year headwind, a negative venture margin of about $50 million. But obviously, I expect as we go through the rest of the year as I said earlier, about another $250 million a headwind as those engine volumes step up. So, I think that's the Pratt story. We clearly will see the aftermarket continue to grow in the remainder of the year. We'll get good drop through on that and that should help to partially offset the negative entry margin headwind that will come with the higher engine deliveries.

The other piece of that. In terms of thinking about the GTF and time-on-wing. Basically what I can say is, our estimates today contemplate everything that we know about the engine. We feel very comfortable with where we are with our contract accounting, and any challenges in terms of cost or additional resources we need to put into that area are already contemplated in the outlook that we have for Pratt and for RTX as a whole. So I don't see that as being a headwind against our expectations for the year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Baird. Your question, Peter.

Q - Peter Arment{BIO 1553462 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone. All these questions for Greg or Chris. Maybe just focusing on RMD and just $35 billion backlog. And you've had some big wins. Obviously, Switzerland was a big one, but maybe if you could just talk a little bit about obviously, customer engagement, it's very high or probably at its highest levels ever. Maybe you could just talk about kind of backdrop ability to continue to grow backlog or some of the bigger booking opportunities that are still out there. Thanks.

A - Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
Yeah. Peter, let me start and I'll turn it over to Chris. But look, we had some very, very strong bookings quarter at RMD. Obviously, the Patriot $1.2 billion for Switzerland, it's a war we've been working on for a number of years -- 18th country to be a Patriot operator. But we see continuing demand that even is still not in the backlog.

We know for instance, so far we've only seen about $2 billion of awards related to Ukraine munitions replenishment. We expect that we'll see more of that coming up later this year and into next year. We also know that there is LTMs for which is the Patriot upgrade system is certified later this year that we'll start to see orders internationally for LTMs also start to pick up, as well as US -- the US DoD.

We're also I think you're going to see very strong bookings on SpaceX. And SpaceX is the new radar system for the Navy. We've had the initial low-rate production contract on that but again much more to come on SpaceX, not just this year, but into the future. On top of that, of course, AMRAAM continues to be very, very solid. There's Tomahawk, which will eventually be replaced by the LRSO.

The fact is the backlog at RMD is only going to grow. We think over the next couple of years. I think again one of the issues at RMD has if you will, you're going to see lower margins on some of these new development contracts, which is depressing the margin this year and next, that will start to turn around as we get into 2025, but it's going to take some time, but that is going to grow.

And the other piece of the puzzle we won't really talk a lot about is the other international customers. Right now, our international sales at RMD are only about 30%, that's below historical levels. That should also improve as we get into LTMs and next-generation of AMRAAM delivery. So lots of good news out there for us, it's just a question of getting it out the door at this point.

As Chris mentioned here, we still are constrained from a supply-chain standpoint, although it's giving a hell of a lot better. We still have work to do. We talked about structural castings at Pratt. For RMD, it's all about rocket motors that impacts TOW, that impacts Javelin, that impacts Stinger, that impact SM-6, SM-3. So again as we work through those supply chain issues, rocket motors that should also drive extraordinary growth in the top-line over the next couple of years.

Q - Peter Arment{BIO 1553462 <GO>}
Okay, thanks.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Your line is open, Ron.

Q - Ronald Epstein{BIO 4430430 <GO>}
Hey, good morning.

A - Christopher Calio{BIO 20062802 <GO>}
Hey, Ron.

Q - Ronald Epstein{BIO 4430430 <GO>}
A question that's come up a lot among investors is, when you think about the GTF and its variance. And on the long-term contracts that have been sold with. Correct me if I'm wrong. It was about 88%[ph] of those engines have been sold with long-term contracts.

A - Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
Correct.

Q - Ronald Epstein{BIO 4430430 <GO>}
And then you have in this time on wing issues, like you mentioned Sheila, it's not an issue this year. But as we go out over time, how can we get confidence that those contracts were actually priced right, particularly the ones that were put in place earlier in the program?

A - Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
Ron, let me -- I'll start, turn over to Chris. Obviously, Chris is intimately familiar with this, having around the commercial engine business in Pratt. I would say that the one bright spot is, most of those contracts were 8 to 10 years in length. If you think about it, they were essentially was introduced back in 2015.

So as you think about the long-term outlook, I am very confident margins are going to improve because we'll have a chance to relook at some of those contracts. But obviously, there is a challenge today with margins because time-on-wing is not what we expected it to be. Reliability and durability are called the two issues. And reliability is great, 99.98% dispatch reliability, time-on-wing is the challenge. But again, I think as Chris explained, we've got some solutions to that which we'll see over the next couple of years.

A - Christopher Calio{BIO 20062802 <GO>}
Yeah. And just to build-on that, Ron. This is Chris. This is why that we are running as fast as we can to continue to insert upgrades into the fleet during shop visits. We've talked before about the sort of the Block D upgrades which are really aimed at combustors hot section improving time-on-wing in those areas. That's only about -- not only about 50% of the way through the fleet in terms of those upgrades.

And so, again we've had some part constraints and shortages and labor in our MRO network which has impacted our ability to output MRO to levels that we and our customers want, which is why we're adding more capacity to that MRO network. You heard me talk about the new Japanese facility, Delta, obviously, a top tier provider joining the network helpful as there as well. So, adding capacity to the networks that we continue to accelerate these upgrades and improve the time-on-wing. At the end of the day, that's what it's all about.

In addition to the contract mix that Greg talked about, it's also about accelerating our repair development making sure that we've got a full suite of repairs in our MRO networks, that we're not always having to replace parts. We can repair parts at a better cost and improve turn times.

Q - Ronald Epstein{BIO 4430430 <GO>}
In fact, if I may as a follow on to this question, same thing. My understanding is the gears is fine, it's the other stuff that's worrying out quicker. How that happened because everybody is worried about the gear, not the other stuff.

A - Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
I think to your point, Ron, the gear has proved to be extremely reliable. We have not seen a gear failure out there, in either 3,000 engines or so that we've delivered. But again, we're operating in some very harsh environments, and I would tell you that we probably didn't spend enough time testing for those harsh environments, specifically places like India. And that's where we've seen the lower life on the combuster. We've seen some lower life on the turbine blades, just because of the harsh conditions there.

So, as we move forward to Chris' point, here we have the advantage coming online. It's got a lot more testing, it's got all the learnings from the existing fleet. There should be significantly more durable out there in terms of time-on-wing. It's going to take us a couple of years to before we can get all of those upgrades introduce.

A - Christopher Calio{BIO 20062802 <GO>}
I mean to your point, Greg. Ron, you're 100% right. The gear in the fuel burn performance have been spot-on in meeting expectations. Keep in mind, this was a new architecture, and we've had some learnings along the way.

The only thing I'll remind you that kind of mentioned this in my remarks. We had a similar journey on the V2500, and it took us a while to get to the levels today that people are enjoying on the V2500. Big difference of course has been the ramp-up on the GTF has been massive ramp versus when the V went into service.

So, there's a little bit more I would say.

Time and buffer to help manage their fleet as it was entering into service, but the playbook is there on the V, we got a follow-up on the GTF.

Q - Ronald Epstein{BIO 4430430 <GO>}
Got it, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss of Barclays. Your question, David.

Q - David Strauss{BIO 20485958 <GO>}
Thanks. Good morning, everyone.

A - Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
Good morning, David.

Q - David Strauss{BIO 20485958 <GO>}
Greg, specifically on the MAX, I think you previously commented that the expectation around Collins and the OE growth rate there was for the MAX to be in the low-30 for you all for the full year. Is that still what you're thinking even with the two issues that have developed here?

And then, second part of the question, just on rocket motors, your view of the potential Aerojet acquisition by LHXN, how that potentially could improve things in terms of rocket motor availability? Thanks.

A - Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
In terms of 737 MAX, I think your current production rate is about 31 a month. A boy had talked about moving that up to 37 a month by the end of the year. I would tell you Collins is right now, I think we're all set at the 31 a month, and it might get a little bit better during the course of the year. But I think again that wouldn't be an issue in terms of our ability to ramp production to meet that.

But right now, again, I think Boeing got some challenges. We'll hear what they have figured out another day or so. But we're, I would say in constant contact with both Boeing and Airbus on OEM rates both at Pratt and at Collins. So, no surprises there to think of that to talk about.

As far as rocket motors, obviously, the potential acquisition by L3Harris of Rocketdyne is something that we have been discussing. There is always a concern, I think when you have one of your key suppliers going through a merger or an acquisition is that they lose focus on delivery and quality, and we are again laser focused. We've got folks out it Aerojet Rocketdyne every single day.

We'll see what happens. I know there's a second request right now with L3Harris as it relates to their potential acquisition and we have been obviously in contact with everyone as it relates to that. So, we'll have to see what happens. But I would tell you, again in the current antitrust environment, no deal is certain until it is actually done. So we'll have to see how this plays out, and make sure that again the Aerojet Rocketdyne continues to focus on delivery and not get distracted by this deal.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn of Melius Research. Your question please, Rob.

Q - Robert Spingarn{BIO 5996882 <GO>}
Good morning.

A - Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
Rob, good morning.

Q - Robert Spingarn{BIO 5996882 <GO>}
Neil, just going back to Collins and I think in 2019, about 40%, 45% of the aftermarket there was from wide-bodies. I wanted to see if you could update us on where that is now and how it's trending relative to narrow bodies, maybe this year and next.

A - Neil G. Mitchill{BIO 18320109 <GO>}
Thanks for the question, Rob. I think what I would say about the growth at Collins right now is the majority of it is still coming from the narrow body. We have started to see wide-body begin to improve. I don't have the exact number in front of me on that mix today. But you know, as we think about the wide-body environment, those volumes are coming up.

I would say, particularly seeing that in the interior business on the OE side as they continue to take those production levels up. And as you said, today I think, Collins is more in the -- on the OE side, probably about 30% of their OE sales relate to wide-body with about 40% from narrow-body. And then on the aftermarket side, I'm sorry -- but let me just stop there. I think that's enough for those numbers right now.

Q - Robert Spingarn{BIO 5996882 <GO>}
Okay. If I could just ask for a follow -- is this is a follow-up to Ron's question. On the GTF losses on the -- on engine delivery and I think you mentioned recently somewhere that's about 1 million per engine. How much that is -- Yeah, how much is that is learning curve versus need for new productivity versus volume. In other words, which of those three things will improve the most?

A - Neil G. Mitchill{BIO 18320109 <GO>}
Volume? Clearly, volume as we continue to ramp back up to levels that we saw pre-pandemic are going to be the tailwind if you will on a per engine reduction in negative engine margin.

As you'll recall, we were already producing the high-50s rate as we kind of entered into 2020. And when you think about the headwind we saw here in the first quarter on 40% higher volume, we're getting good absorption as we continue to take up those engine volumes. I expect that to continue.

We always work and productivity. We work in productivity to offset the growing costs that we're seeing, particularly on the casting side. So, we're doing all of those things. But I would say, what's going to drop to the bottom line is going to be driven by that higher volume and the absorption that comes from that.

Q - Robert Spingarn{BIO 5996882 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Neil.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert of RBC. Your question please, Ken.

Q - Ken Herbert{BIO 17666707 <GO>}
Yes. Hi, good morning. I wanted to stay on Collins Aerospace for a minute. First-quarter aftermarket numbers we're continuing to be pretty strong, you're seeing better pricing. Is it fair to assume that there is upside to sort of the full year aftermarket expectations within Collins or how do we see the sort of the remainder of the year progressing with tough comps, but with still very strong fundamentals and demand?

A - Neil G. Mitchill{BIO 18320109 <GO>}
Thanks for that question, Ken. Clearly, the first quarter was a good strong start. Collins has a lot of operating profit growth in our year-over-year plan between $750 million and $825 million and certainly seeing a little over $200 million of that happened in the first quarter was encouraging.

And I think when you look at the provisioning numbers that we saw from Collins, very strong obviously. I think a lot of that was driven by these airlines getting ready to put their fleets up in the air and be prepared to continue to fly through the summer travel season. It's certainly a watch item today. I would say, our aftermarket outlook for Collins is in the low-teens plus range. So, certainly a positive indicator, but it's one-quarter into the year. It's a little early to kind of take those numbers up. But certainly, if they continue at this level, there will be goodness and we'll see that goodness dropped to the bottom line.

But certainly, a great start, driven by all the right things. The China reopening certainly gave a boost in the first quarter for Collins. And as we see OE deliveries continue to -- at least stabilize and grow as the year goes on and I think that too will add some tailwind there. But a little early to kind of give a bigger number at this point.

Q - Ken Herbert{BIO 17666707 <GO>}
Great, thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen. Your question please, Cai.

Q - Cai von Rumohr{BIO 1504358 <GO>}
Thanks so much. So, two issues at Pratt. First, you mentioned NEM was $50 million in the first quarter, deliveries were up $48 million, so that's a little more than a million a unit. And yet, if we look at the back part of the year, it should be another $50 million to $70 million some like that. And so why does NEM go up to $250 million, that seems an acceleration in the level per unit.

And secondly, your aftermarket in the first quarter, up 14%. If I take out price, you're probably flat to up 1% and I recognize it's a tough year-over-year compare. Why was it so low, and as part of that the castings shortage and having to allocate parts to a way. Thank you.

A - Christopher Calio{BIO 20062802 <GO>}
So let me take the first one. I think we can take it offline, Cai and Jennifer can help you a little bit. But I think as we look at the volume uptick as we go through the rest of the year, you'll find that when you combine that with the mix of new and spare engines that are negative engine margin is stable, if not reducing a little bit. So, feel good about that. There's a number of different engine family that make that up. So, we don't see any issues there in terms of cost headwinds or degradation on a per-engine basis as the rest of the year goes.

As you think about the aftermarket, a couple of thoughts there. I had mentioned that we were addressing and dealing with the material flow and availability. Certainly, the castings are playing a part in that in terms of allocations amongst MRO and OE deliveries. But we did see price improvements in the Pratt & Whitney portfolio as we do every year, and the volume is also dropping through the content on the shop visits. It's also stepping up across almost all segments at Pratt & Whitney large and the small engine business as well.

So, we're seeing the right momentum there and I do expect that as we continue to see the casting improvements elivate[ph], as the year goes on, you'll see that also drop through in the top and bottom line.

A - Gregory J. Hayes{BIO 5547891 <GO>}
I mean, Cai, the key for Pratt in terms of the aftermarket really goes back to V2500 and we see very strong input. But I think shop visits were up more than 10% here in the quarter. So, pricing is a part of it to Neil's point, but really it is the volume coming back into the shops as these engines are flying more.

Q - Cai von Rumohr{BIO 1504358 <GO>}
