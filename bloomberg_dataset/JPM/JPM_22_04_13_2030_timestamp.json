From where we sit here, to your point, a number of these items are in fact going to bleed back in relatively quickly, some faster than others.

So then if you line that up against the sort of rising minimums, of course we have the increase in the GSIB requirement in the first quarter of 'twenty three coming in. And then there's the question of SCB where, you know, we don't know obviously, but given the countercyclical nature of the stress and the fact that the unemployment launch point is a lot lower and that the unemployment rate is floored in the Fed scenario, you might expect SCB to be a little bit higher when it's published in June, effective in the fourth quarter. But that gives us time to make any adjustments that we need to make. So I guess to summarize, when we put all this together, between improved income generation, some of the denominator decay effects and the various levers that we have available to pull across the dimension of time as new information comes into play, we really feel quite good about our capital position from here and the trajectory as we look forward and minimums evolve.",
