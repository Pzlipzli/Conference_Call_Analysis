Presentation
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is John, I'll be your conference coordinator today. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

Now, I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.

Steven Winoker{BIO 15988218 <GO>}
Thanks, John. Good morning all and apologies for the delay due to technical reasons. We had to switch to a backup line, it was choppy for a lot of investors and we wanted to make sure everyone could hear. I'm joined today for our first quarter 2021 earnings call by our Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp; and CFO, Carolina Dybeck Happe.

Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release and presentation are available on our website. Note that some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and in our website, those elements can change as the world changes.

With that, I'll hand the call over to Larry.

H. Lawrence Culp{BIO 1487306 <GO>}
Steve, thanks and good morning all. Despite continued challenges in aviation and a still difficult comparison to last year, the first quarter marked a solid start to 2021. I'm confident this sets us up well to deliver on our '21 commitments and profitable growth for the long-term.

Looking at the first quarter numbers on Slide 2. Orders were down 8% organically, primarily driven by Aviation Services and Power Equipment, was partially offset by continued strength in healthcare and renewables well as growth in Power Services. We're seeing better performance in our shorter cycle service businesses, ex-Aviation Service orders were up 6% organically in the quarter. Our backlog stands at $833 billion [ph], remains a strength with approximately 80% year toward services where we have higher margins. Industrial revenue was down 10% organically. Services continue to be a main focus as they were down 14% while services may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter especially as we've seen during the pandemic, we still expect growth in services this year. Ex-Aviation industrial revenue was up 1% organically.

Adjusted industrial margin was 5.1%, up 110 basis points organically. Notably, we saw organic expansion year-over-year, with three of our four business is improving as our cost actions 2020 continue to take hold. Adjusted EPS was $0.03 with the majority of business improving offsetting Aviation. Carolina will provide more color shortly.

Industrial free cash flow was a negative $845 million, encouragingly this was up $1.7 billion ex-BioPharma driven by better learnings and working capital. In all, we're seeing continued progress, especially on margins and cash flow. And we believe these improvements are sustainable. As we look to the second quarter, we expect industrial free cash flow growth of similar magnitude to what we saw this quarter. And despite ongoing volatility, as the world fights through the pandemic, the guidance we provided a month ago remains unchanged.

Turning to Slide 3, there's a lot we're doing day-in and day-out to build momentum across GE. During last month, we agreed to combine GECAS with AerCap, marking a significant catalyst in our journey to focus GE on its core four industrial businesses: Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, Healthcare. And each business is critical to the global markets they serve. This transaction enables us to further strengthen the company for the long-term. At closing, bringing our total debt reduction to more than $70 billion over the last three years, while drastically simplifying GE in a number of ways, including our financial reporting.

All the while we've been fortifying GE's Foundation, this starts first with our resilient and passionate team. They have been instrumental in driving our lean transformation forward and I'm grateful for their service. As we scale lead across the company, we're working to deliver safety, quality, delivery and cost improvement, as well as high quality growth.

One recent example comes from digital services and renewables. We heard from our customers that our cycle times and responsiveness needed improvement. A lean Kaizen event reveal multiple systems and inconsistent process is in the way. We value stream mapping, we develop standard work, the decreased cycle time by 70%, enabling us to bid for and win more business. This is already led to more than $70 million of backlog growth. Opportunities like these for high impact deployment of lean are bound throughout our company.

We're coupling lean with a significant decentralization effort. This means managing, not just the four segments we report, but the nearly 30 businesses underneath them, where the work, GE is done. This combination of lean and decentralization is maximizing value for our customers, while increasing accountability at the business level. And even though it's still early in our journey, we are seeing tangible operational and financial results. For example, at a recent operating review of power conversion, I was thrilled to see how the team strategy is coming together. Optimizing their operations through lean and redefining their market focus. This has led to double-digit order growth in the quarter, in three consecutive quarters of organic margin expansion.

The stronger foundation sets us up to spend more time playing offense. Our first priority is investment to drive organic growth efforts. We're improving our team's abilities to market, talent service the products we have today. And at the same time, we're strengthening our offerings with new product introductions. As you may have seen recently, we've had some major wins across the portfolio. In renewables, we were selected to supply more than 530 turbines to North Central Wind Energy Facilities in Oklahoma, marking the largest onshore wind project in GE's history.

At Aviation, CFM secured LEAP engine and service agreements from Southwest Airlines, and Scandinavian Airlines to power 100 MAX and 35 A320neo aircraft. Meanwhile, in healthcare we've launched new ultrasound solutions, the Vscan and Venue, the industry's first AI offering for cardiac imaging. These innovations are supporting clinicians who need fast reliable insights at the point of care, now more than ever. And while we're continuing to invest in technology and innovation to serve our customers in the lead our markets in the future, fortifying our competition globally is a paramount importance. Over time, we will look to augment our organic efforts with inorganic investments, that accelerate the implementation of our strategy and create real value for customers and investors alike.

So as we think about what we're planning for, it is the long-term, building a world that works. At GE, our technology and expertise across critical markets enable us to lead, along with our customers in creating a more sustainable future. Our renewables and power businesses stood at the heart of the energy transition. Our opportunities were on full display last week during the Earth Week. In renewables, we've held the number one position in North America onshore wind two years running. And this is the fastest growing source of new power generation capacity.

At Gas Power, we're playing a vital complementary role in decarbonizing at scale as customers shift from coal to gas. And as we modernize the power grid with digital and automation solutions, we have an opportunity, have an even bigger impact. In Healthcare, we're at the forefront of the precision health revolution. We have a leading position in many imaging modalities, and we're growing our digital and AI capabilities, which will enhance the personalization of diagnostics and therapeutics. Take an area like cancer screening, our solutions are improving patient outcomes, helping clinicians rule out false positives and streamlining workflows for providers and payers alike.

And as we look to the future of flight, no business is better positioned than our Aviation business. In the near term, our focus is getting people back into the air safely. And as the market recovers from COVID, we're well placed with the largest and youngest engine platform with more than 37,000 commercial engines and more than 60% of our fleet, that is not yet had a second shop visit. Underscoring the value our platform will generate for decades to come.

As we tackle the world's most complex challenges, we're also passionate about delivering for our customers, across our vast global installed base. It's our services that keep us close to our customers, day-in and day-out and create a significant source of recurring revenue. By staying true to our purpose and our customers, we'll unlock further upside potential in growth, profit and cash generation leading to high-single digit free cash flow margins over the next few years.

Stepping back, we're on a positive trajectory in 2021 and beyond. We're focused on delivering on our commitments and I'm confident that our continued efforts will build a stronger and more focused GE.

With that, Carolina will provide further insights on the quarter.

Carolina Dybeck Happe{BIO 5606359 <GO>}
Thanks, Larry. As you mentioned, our decentralization efforts continues. Now our (inaudible) is playing a critical role. We're developing and supporting a more granular operating view of our nearly 30 P&Ls, and we are building lean scale to ensure the processes we're setting up, are truly been an automated. We're also deepening our focus on cash, and strengthening our operational muscles, especially seeing this with billings and collections. And we're really driving services growth, a key component to unlocking improved profitability. For example, as we execute contract, we're more focused on cost productivity and standard work. I'm confident, this improved discipline will translate into improved results.

Turning to Slide 4. Before we dive into the results, two items. First, with the announcement of AerCap and GECAS combination, GECAS has moved to discontinued operations. As a result, we booked a day one loss on sale on our financials, have been recast to reflect this transfer, with depreciations reducing on the portfolio. Going forward, any changes to earnings associated with GECAS (inaudible) will primarily be driven by the AerCap stock price. Second, we're planning to transition our quarterly backlog disclosures to our remaining performance obligation basis or RPO, starting in the second quarter. These changes will simplify and streamline our reporting, further aligning our key metrics to those commonly used across our sector and reducing unnecessary extra work.

Now let me provide some color on the quarter, on an organic basis. Looking at the top line, recall that -- our business is only partially felt the impact of the pandemic in the first quarter of '20. Aviation continues to be challenged managing through market volatility, which has weighed on our overall performance. Industrial revenue was down 10% this quarter, largely driven by services. However, ex-Aviation revenue was up 1%. We're focusing on improved services growth across the portfolio. Healthcare equipment and services continued to be at strength. We saw increased demand as global procedure volumes recovered to pre-pandemic levels. While power declined and renewables was roughly flat, this was largely driven by our increased focus on profitable growth. Examples include, reducing turnkey scope in Gas Power, exiting new coal in power portfolio and increasing project selectivity in renewables.

Next, Industrial margins expanded 110 basis points with Power, Renewables and Healthcare all contributing. Ex-Aviation margins expanded 450 basis points, a couple of standouts. One, Gas Power services with double-digit revenue growth and significant margin expansion, and this was supported by better performance in our transactional and (inaudible) portfolio. And two, Healthcare margin expansion, this was driven by better volume and cost productivity due to our lean efforts and expense management. We also continue to see sustainable benefits from our cost actions, including reduced head count of roughly 23,000 year-over-year. We are on track to realize the incremental $1 billion of benefits in 2021.

Finally, adjusted EPS was $0.03 in the quarter. This reflects $0.04 of improvement year-over-year ex-BioPharma, driven in roughly equal parts by industrial and capital performance. As we walk from continuing to adjusted EPS, we need to exclude the positive Baker mark, as well as the negative impacts of significant higher cost restructuring programs and non-operating expenses, primarily pension. Overall, we're encouraged by our industrial margin improvement.

Moving to cash, industrial free cash flow was negative $845 million, a use of cash and a decline from the fourth quarter, which we expect seasonally, consistent with what we shared earlier in the quarter. However, we saw significant progress across a number of our businesses with cash flow up $1.4 billion year-over-year and ex-BioPharma, up $1.7 billion, driven by earnings and working capital improvement. Looking at earnings, they were down year-over-year on a reported basis. However, as I mentioned earlier, earnings were up, excluding the impact of biopharma in Baker, with adjusted Industrial organic profit up 18%.

Moving to working capital, this was a use of $900 million this quarter. We're seeing progress across the Board with payables and inventories contributing the most of the improvement, looking at the flows within the quarter. Receivables were sourced from higher seasonal collections and daily management, well be also reduced short-term factoring, which negatively impacted our free cash flow by $800 million. Our focus on stronger billings and collections continued with two days of DSO improvement. For example, in Aviation Services, within our CSA portfolio, we're using value stream mapping and daily management and have improved billing timeliness by 16%. Inventory for the use of cash of $700 million, this was largely driven by renewables as expected to support second half volume.

Inventory remains a key focus area for all lenders. Take our Healthcare business, where we're improving by half a turn year-over-year. When I recently visited our team in Life Care Solutions, they showed me how their Hoshin Kanri project reduced inventory by more than 5% already this quarter, while delivering cost savings. We continuously sharing this learnings across GE to inspire and accelerate further improvement. Payables were the use of $400 million. We saw seasonally lower volume in Power and Aviation. There was a significant improvement year-over-year. Progress was also a use of $400 million as deliveries outpaced collections. Contract assets was flat as deliveries offset collection. So, working capital without the $800 million impact of the factoring reduction would have been close to flat this quarter and year-over-year working capital flow was $1.6 billion better, overall, a significant improvement.

We carefully optimizing our capital investments to drive long-term growth. CapEx spend was up 18% sequentially, yet down 37% year-over-year. We've increased rigor in our investments, by focusing on high return and strategically differentiated technologies, including the Haliade-X and renewables, and PDx capacity expansion in Healthcare. In all, our efforts to improve working capital are taking hold and with additional opportunities near term. Over time, sustainable free cash flow generation will mainly come from profitable organic growth combined with higher margins and longer term efficient capital deployment.

Turning to liquidity and leverage on Slide 6. We've continued to solidify our financial position. This quarter, we've reduced debt by approximately $4 billion. Our liquidity is strong and we have ample additional liquidity sources for future deleveraging actions. This includes process from the GECAS transaction, positive cash flow and monetizing our remaining stakes in Baker and AerCap. Post transaction close, we expect to reduce debt significantly, bringing our total reduction to more than $70 billion, since the end of 2018. Additionally, we do not anticipate any further funding requirement for the GE Pension Plan in the foreseeable future. And by that, I mean, at the end of the decade, this is due to our $2.5 billion pre-funding in 2020, our investment portfolio performance as well as the recently enacted American Rescue Plan Act.

Since the beginning of 2019, we reduced our factoring balance by $8 billion, bringing it down to about $6 billion at quarter end. Effective April 1st, we discontinued the majority of our factoring programs. As I talked about outlook, we will exclude the related cash flow impact going forward, which we expect to be between $3.5 billion and $4 billion, the majority of this will be felt in the second quarter. Combining this with $3.5 billion to $4 billion, with $800 billion reported cash impact in the first quarter from the normal course activity, equates [ph] to the $4 billion to $5 billion range of cash, that we described last month. If you apply the same logic and cancel out the factoring effect from our discontinued programs in 2020, after re-baselining for BioPharma and COVID-related volume in Healthcare, you get to re-baseline free cash flow of about positive $2.4 billion in 2020.

Our 2021 reported free cash flow range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion includes the impact of the negative $800 million factoring in the first quarter. Excluding the full-year impact from factoring, the majority of our cash flow improvement in 2021 comes from earnings. As we reduced our reliance on factoring, we will continue to focus on further improvement on our core billings and collections capabilities, leading to better cash performance over time, and there is no change to our view from outlook, while the improvement is driven by our underlying operating performance. Due to us reducing factoring, as well as better managing working capital and cash, our peak quarterly cash have decreased more than $4 billion in the year, a significant improvement. You know, we expected net debt to EBITDA of less than 2.5 times over the next few years and maintain a strong investment-grade rating.

Moving to our business results, which I'll speak to on an organic basis. First on Power, our Gas Power and Power Portfolio team continued to make progress. We're especially encouraged by the growth in Gas Power services. Overall Power remains on track to deliver their financial commitments for the year.

Looking at the market, global electricity demand grew 3% this quarter, driving GE Gas turbine utilization, and CSA billings up high-single digits. Orders declined 12% in the quarter. At Gas Power, equipment orders were down 50%, driven by the non-repeat of a large turnkey order. However, we booked 18 turbines up 9, and notably service orders were up 11% with contractual and transactional growth. This was driven by higher outages and stronger commercial performance compared to the pandemic related disruptions last year.

Our Power Portfolio orders were down 16% as we expected, driven by our planned exit of the new build coal business at Steam. This was partially offset by double-digit growth at power conversion. Backlog of $78 billion, decreased year-over-year, largely driven by timing of equipment orders and contractual service commitments. Gas Power accounts for roughly 80% of this backlog. Revenue was down, Gas Power was down 2%, this was driven by equipment, down 25%. We had significantly lower turnkey scope project as anticipated, while at the same time we ship more heavy duty gas turbines this quarter, up six and we commissioned 3.6 gigawatts of power to the grid, including 3HA units.

As you heard from Scott, at outlook, we've been more selective on turnkey projects and we're transitioning to more equipment project which is better risk return equation over time. We saw meaningful improvement in services revenue, up 13% due to strong transactional backlog execution and higher outages. Our portfolio revenue was down 9% driven by Steam, offsetting this Power Conversion and Nuclear were both up. Segment margin was negative, but improving by 110 basis points. Gas Power margin was positive and expanded significantly, this was largely driven by positive mix from higher margin services volume and reducing fixed costs. Power Portfolio margin contracted, but largely driven by Steam project execution and unfavorable legacy project arbitration resolution. We're progressing through our planned exit of new-build coal and concluded our European Works Council consultations this quarter. Both Power Conversion and Nuclear expanded margins operational improvements continued.

Turning to Renewables, we're playing a leadership role in the energy transition while building a profitable growth business for GE. We continue to improve operational execution and scale offshore wind and we remain on track for our full-year commitments. Starting with the market, in Onshore Wind, we expect in the U.S. market to slightly decrease this year, while robust growth continues abroad. In Offshore Wind, the strong market trends are expected to continue through the decade. And broadly speaking, grid is positioned to gain momentum as the energy transition accelerates and government stimulus increases.

Now on the quarter. Orders grew double-digits in Onshore, Offshore and Grid Solutions, all up. Grid was the biggest driver following a large HVDC system order. Onshore Wind services, including more than 120 repower units increased significantly. Offshore Wind is building momentum with more Haliade-X orders expected in the second half. Revenue was flat, with equipment revenues growth up high-single digits, offset by a significant decline in services. In Onshore Wind, equipment was higher with more than 760 units delivered, while services were down as we did not deliver any repower upgrades. However, digital services were up significantly excluding repower. Offshore Wind growth was driven by continued execution on EdF's 6 megawatt PBG project in France.

Grid decline due to deal selectivity and commercial execution. Segment margin, while negative, improved by 310 basis points. In Onshore Wind, margin improved significantly, driven by cost productivity and execution, partly offset by product mix. In Grid, post-out more than offset incremental restructuring expenses. Next on aviation, our term continues to position the business for the rebound, despite current market challenges. As the Aviation end market recovers, which we believe will begin in the second half, we expect to deliver on our '21 outlook, revenue growth, margin expansion and better cash generation. GE CFM departures were down 40% year-over-year, in line with our guide from outlook.

We're encouraged that March departure levels improved significantly versus January and February, but regional pressures continue, especially in Europe and Asia ex-China. Orders were down more than 25% with Commercial Services down more than 40% but some improvement sequentially. And Commercial Engines down less than 10%, supported by multiple large orders, including one [ph] for 22, GE9X engine. The Aviation backlog stands at about $260 billion, down slightly sequentially, the largest drivers for commercial engines and services, with approximately 400 LEAP-1B cancellations.

For context, our LEAP unit backlog stands at more than 9,200 engines. The revenue decline was driven by Commercial Engines, down double-digits and Commercial Services, down 40%. Commercial services, saw lower spare part sales and lower shop visits. Although dynamics varied by engine and region, shop visits were broadly in line with our guided outlook. In military, revenue was flat due to favorable equipment mix, despite 50 lower unit shipments. Overall, engine deliveries remain pressured, primarily in rotorcraft [ph]. And our team continues to address the supply chain challenges.

Statement margin contracted to approximately 13%, primarily driven by Commercial Services. However, decrementals improved to 19% and margin expanded sequentially as our cost actions continue to take hold. We're on track to realize the incremental $0.5 billion of benefits in 2021.

Moving to Healthcare, we are excited about the progress resilient. The team's strong performance shows how implementing lean and decentralization is driving real results. Overall market fundamentals are also improving. For the third consecutive quarter, global procedure volumes were up double digits. Demand for non-pandemic products was solid as government stimulus drove strong order growth in China, India and Japan. Meanwhile, demand for pandemic related products began to normalize. We're seeing elective procedures return to pre-pandemic levels, but there is still much for us to do to support our customers. Many are running at reduced capacity and have patients waiting longer than usual for screening treatments and procedures.

With that backdrop, Healthcare orders continued to improve. Healthcare system orders were up 5%, with the equipment and services growth. Imaging and Ultrasound improve double digit, both year-over-year and compared to the first quarter '19 and CT grew across all regions, while Life Care Solutions orders were down as pandemic related demand softened. PDx demand continued to recover with orders up 7%, driven by CT screening for cardiac disease and routine oncology and neurology screenings returning to pre-pandemic level. Healthcare revenue was also up. Healthcare system up 7% across businesses to highlights [ph]. Ultrasound demand was high with growth across most regions and all product lines and Life Care Solutions grew again this quarter. PDx revenue was up 7% with elective procedures returning to pre-pandemic levels. Segment margins expanded an impressive 270 basis points, driven by profitable growth and continued cost reduction, while we still invest for growth, especially in imaging, ultrasound and LCS.

Moving to Slide 8. At Capital adjusted continuing operations generated a net loss, which was half of last year's loss. This was primarily driven by insurance and tax, partially offset by lower EFS gains. At issuance, we continued to see a positive claims trend and strong investment results versus last year, when we had pandemic related marks [ph] and impairments as well.

GE Capital assets excluding cash were down on the $6 billion sequentially, driven by the GECAS transaction and lower factoring. Within discontinued operations -- to call out, the GECAS had a net loss of $2.6 billion, which includes the loss on sale of $2.8 billion from the AerCap transaction, offset by about $200 million of earnings. We see collections progress on previously granted deferrals and we ended the quarter with 20 aircraft on ground. We may see levels fluctuate throughout 2021 due to the continued market volatility. We've previously noted ongoing litigation related to our run-off Polish mortgage portfolio. This quarter we recorded charges of approximately $300 million, this is based on the rising number of borrower lawsuits filed and expected to be filed in the future, as well at higher discount rates. We expect upcoming decision of the European Court of Justice and the Polish Supreme Court to have an impact on the litigation landscape for Polish banks, including our run-off Polish mortgage business.

Moving to corporate. We remain focused on leaner processes and decentralization. If I compare the adjusted corporate costs with when I started a year ago, we are down almost 50%, most notably here our functional costs and operations, which improved over 40%. And GE Digital, focusing on driving growth and improved profitability with a strong performance from grid software this quarter.

Taking a step back, Larry and I recognize the positive sustainable impact that lean recreated GE. We are picking up the pace. And while it's still early, we are building momentum with measurable impact this quarter, as you've seen, this is becoming more visible at corporate as well, with significantly transform how we operate moving more work to the businesses and further streamlining the remaining corporate functions. And we have an increased focus on strategy, capital allocation, research, talent and governance.

Now, Larry, back to you.

H. Lawrence Culp{BIO 1487306 <GO>}
Carolina, thanks. Let's go to Slide 9. In summary, this quarter was a solid start to 2021. Thanks to our team, we're making measurable and sustainable progress and we're setup well to deliver on our 2021 commitments that we shared with you in March. Since joining GE, one of my top priorities has been instilling greater focus throughout the organization. The GECAS transaction announced last month marks an important step forward in making GE, a more focused, simpler and stronger industrial company, when this even better positioned to serve the needs of our customers and the world, with leading technologies and strong service capabilities across our installed base.

As we are building a world that works we're also creating a more sustainable future, leading in the energy transition, driving more integrated and personalized healthcare and enabling smarter and more efficient flight. I hope the business examples we've shared today helped -- the real operational and cultural change is underway at GE. There are many steps big and small happening across our company right now that make me excited about the future. We remain focused on growth, profit and cash generation, and I'm confident in our ability to drive value for the long-term.

Steve, with that, let's go to questions.

Steven Winoker{BIO 15988218 <GO>}
Thanks, Larry. And before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider you fellow analysts again, and ask just one question, so that we can get to as many people as possible. John, can you please open the line?

Questions And Answers
Operator
Yes. Our first question is from Markus Mittermaier from UBS.

Q - Markus Mittermaier{BIO 20039704 <GO>}
Yeah. Hi, good morning Larry, Carolina and Steve.

A - H. Lawrence Culp{BIO 1487306 <GO>}
Good morning.

A - Carolina Dybeck Happe{BIO 5606359 <GO>}
Good morning.

A - Steven Winoker{BIO 15988218 <GO>}
Good morning.

Q - Markus Mittermaier{BIO 20039704 <GO>}
Good morning. Maybe I'll start with the bigger picture question here, Larry. So you talked more and more about playing offense and playing for the long term here. If I bring this back to free cash flow, I know that you kind of guide to 2023 up high-single digit free cash flow margins. But your moves a lot of headwind, Carolina mentioned that the pension headwind is gone potentially out at the end of the decade. The factoring headwind, I think even if you look at the near term here, the $4 billion to $5 billion guide that we all reflect that -- I think the near-term impact is probably $800 million (inaudible). I think you kind of implicitly increase here, your cash flow guide today, unless I'm misinterpreting that. But if I take it most of the long-term, right. And I look at sort of these removed headwind in peers in a lot of the business being significantly above that price in the business free cash flow margin, how do you think about the portfolio and that target in the long-term?

A - H. Lawrence Culp{BIO 1487306 <GO>}
Marcus, a couple of comments there. Let me just level set. I think what we're trying to do today is reiterate that what we said about a month ago or so, at the GECAS announcement with respect to our outlook for this year in terms of free cash potential, the $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion, that's intact. So, no intention to change that. As Carolina highlighted, we did have $800 million of factoring discontinuation pressure in the first quarter, that we're not adjusting for -- but we do want to flag it for you, because it's akin to what we will adjust for more formally the rest of the year, now that we have formally discontinued the factoring program. But I think that as you look at longer-term (Technical Difficulty) thereafter, right. And we're really talking about you take the mid-point of that, call it 8%, on let's say the '19 revenue base somewhere in the $85 billion to $90 billion range, that gets us to a $7 billion free cash number.

I think given the way we are running the businesses better today, at least compared to what I saw when I walked in 2.5 years ago. The opportunities, I think we have clearly frame in front of us, around the energy transition, around precision health, around the future of flight. And as you highlight, as Carolina noted, a number of the headwinds will dissipate over time, be it some of the restructuring and power, via pension, I mean, what terrific news that is for us, in addition to the interest stepdown and the like. So there's a lot of things that we're working on, that we're encouraged by, there are a number of things that are going to dissipate over time and you put all that together, while we've got plenty of work to do. So, there is no declaration of victory here, I think, we're just trying to underscore our continued confidence, that we can deliver on those numbers over time.

Clearly, we need aviation to come back, I think, we're encouraged by a number of the signs there. The U.S. clearly coming back, China above where they were a year ago, let alone '19 at this point. So that's encouraging, but certainly other parts of the world, as you well know, are still fighting this horrible pandemic, that creates a little bit of the volatility that we referred to. But all-in, we continue to believe the aviation recovery is more a matter of when, not if, and again with that 37,000 strong narrow-body fleet out there, the youngest in the industry, we think we're well positioned to serve and to deliver results for our investors as that occurs.

Operator
Our next question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.

Q - Julian Mitchell{BIO 21229700 <GO>}
Hi, good morning. Just wanted to try and clarify that Q2 industrial free cash flow comment. So is the point that when you're talking about the year-on-year improvement, we should expect of that, I suppose $2.1 billion base, we should be thinking about a sort of $1.7 billion increase ex-BioPharma. I just wanted to make sure which sort of comparison point we were using. And also maybe highlights of that, any comments around how satisfied you are with the progress on aviation profitability? You already hit a low double-digit margin in Q1, I mean, that was the guide for the year.

A - Carolina Dybeck Happe{BIO 5606359 <GO>}
Okay. So let me start with the question on the second quarter free cash flow. So, what I mentioned was that, we saw the improvement year-over-year to your point there of $1.7 billion, excluding BioPharma of free cash flow, and we do expect to see similar improvement in the second quarter, so that's the right way to look at it.

A - H. Lawrence Culp{BIO 1487306 <GO>}
Julian, good morning. With respect to Aviation, you're right, the 12.8% op-margin print in the quarter is good. All things considered, but organically, down 200 basis points from where we were a year ago. I think the top line little softer than we had anticipated, primarily a function of service is getting off to a slightly slower start. And frankly, we continue to be challenged, I think we mentioned this in our prepared remarks, on the military side of the house, just in terms of deliveries. We have some past due backlog where that we need to clear, which will be helpful as well. So as we go through the year, I think you'll see the cost efforts from last year play out. Clearly, the comps get easier as we get a better mix of business with services coming back. We clear those issues in military, in the military side of the business, you should continue to see us improve the margins from here. But again, where we really need that overall market recovery to play out, as we believe it will largely in the second half -- beginning in the second half.

Our next question is from Steve Tusa from J.P. Morgan.

Q - Stephen Tusa
Hey guys, good morning.

A - H. Lawrence Culp{BIO 1487306 <GO>}
Good morning, Steve.

A - Carolina Dybeck Happe{BIO 5606359 <GO>}
Good morning.

Q - Stephen Tusa
So just a follow-up on Julian's question. Can you just give us the base of what the factoring headwind actually was last year in the first quarter and the second quarter on an absolute basis? And then for the year, so are we -- is the $800 million you did in the first quarter, plus the $3.5 billion to $4 billion in the second. Is that how you get to the $4 billion to $5 billion, or is a part of the $4 billion to $5 billion still to come after second quarter? It's just a bit confusing. I think in 8-K with all this would be helpful. But just if you could be specific about the first quarter impact -- absolute impact in '20 and the second quarter absolute impact in '20, that we can kind of figure out what the basis is.

A - Carolina Dybeck Happe{BIO 5606359 <GO>}
Good morning, Steve. So, maybe let us go back to outlook. So that outlook we said that we would basically discontinue the majority of our factoring programs, right? And we talked about that the impact of that would be $4 billion to $5 billion on our cash flow, right. So what you see is the $800 million of reduction that we have in the first quarter, that still in our numbers because it's before we technically discontinued. So, you have that $800 million. And then we expect 2Q through 4Q to be $3.5 billion to $4 billion, the majority of that in the second quarter. If you take that together, you get $4.3 billion to $4.8 billion for the full year and that's then in line with the $4 billion to $5 billion that we shared at outlook.

Q - Stephen Tusa
Okay. And what is the -- what is the year-over-year impact of these, because they were talking about absolute free cash flow impact versus year-over-year impact. Sometimes, I don't know people talk about the impact being year-over-year versus absolute, what is kind of the year-over-year impact?

A - Carolina Dybeck Happe{BIO 5606359 <GO>}
Yeah, exactly. And that's also why we were talking about it. We talked about the impact in 2021, but that's also why we are helping you to re-baseline 2020, reduced sort of from the factoring noise. And if you do that, we talked at outlook about 2020 starting with $600 million you rebase that for -- we talked about the COVID and we talked about BioPharma to zero. If you then take out the equivalent, get to a positive free cash flow of $2.4 billion for 2020. And your question, specifically on the first quarter, in the first quarter in 2021, you obviously have the headwind of $800 million, that you saw in our numbers here, that you then mentally adjust for. And then the equivalent of last year's reduction of those programs is about a $1 billion, right. So if you do the comparison there, those are the numbers for the first quarter.

Our next question is from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.

Q - Andrew Obin{BIO 6337802 <GO>}
Yes. And just not to talk too much about factoring but $1.7 billion improvement, you expect in industrial free cash flow in second quarter. So, just can you walk us through how much of it is factoring, drag going away and how much of the year-over-year improvement is earnings driven versus other working capital improvement? And if you could just give us directionally color by segment, as to what drives the year-over-year improvement, that would be great as well. Thank you.

A - Carolina Dybeck Happe{BIO 5606359 <GO>}
Hi, Andrew. So if we start with the improvement for second quarter, what we are saying is that we expect the improvement to be roughly in line, so the improvement that you saw in the first quarter and that's on the reported -- on the reported basis, right. When it comes to the composition of that, we expect a healthy part of that to be profit improvement, but also working capital improvement.

Our next question is from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.

Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague{BIO 1494958 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning.

A - H. Lawrence Culp{BIO 1487306 <GO>}
Hi, Jeffrey.

Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague{BIO 1494958 <GO>}
Good morning all. Yeah, let me just kind of join the free cash flow question party here. I guess, my question would be, with the type of visibility that you're -- you have on Q2 at this point, the year range actually feels kind of wide now, right. Certainly looking about looking at kind of historical patterns. Maybe just a little color on what the big variances are in the back half, right. I know you're going to have seven [ph] ADAs and progress payments moving around. Like what are the really big kind of swing factors or cushion items that may be define the lower end of that range for the year?

A - H. Lawrence Culp{BIO 1487306 <GO>}
Yeah, let me let me take that, at the outset. I'm not sure I would buy into your premise, that we've got the visibility that you're suggesting that we do. I think, the range that we have today, in line, obviously, with the range that we've shared since early in the year, captures what we know and what we don't know. Clearly, we're waiting for Aviation to begin to snapback, that is an important swing factor for us. And I think we've been consistent talking about that. I don't think there is much of a historical (inaudible) in that business, given the way the pandemic is ravaging various parts of the world. And in turn, both leisure and business travel are clearly we have a new administration and is doing a lot of good things, medium to long-term here to help, I think fuel our renewables business and the growth there. But the order book is, it often is back-loaded in onshore and offshore.

We -- as our customers do need to have, I think better visibility with respect to number of funding programs, tax policy changes and regulatory approvals, that will have a real impact on orders and in term down payments in that business. So, I don't want to lay out a long list, but there are a number of moving pieces here. And given the nature of our business, as you well know, the number of orders are often large and they carry with them significant cash impacts when they happen, and negative effects when they don't. So, I think what we're going to do going forward, is what we've done here in the last several years, tell you what we know, tell you what we don't. I think we are mindful that the factoring dynamic creates some noise here. But again, as we've said, a couple of times, no change to the effect, $4 billion to $5 billion, as we discontinued the factoring programs and operationally we feel good about the $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. If we can get that, get to the high end of that range rate, great, if we can do better, we will. But it's a long-term game here and that's the way we're going to play it out.

Hey, there is a lot of Ex right now, across the industrials, about Boston inflation supply chain disruptions. I did see in the appendix, on the military aviation cited some supply chain pressures. But just broadly, where are the pinch points, is it -- would it represent a particular headwind for the second quarter or for the balance of the year? And any update there would be helpful. Thanks.

A - H. Lawrence Culp{BIO 1487306 <GO>}
Sure. Deane, you're touching on a couple of different things. Let me try to take them in order. From a price cost perspective, a number of moving pieces. We're clearly seeing some price pressure not unlike what you've heard about elsewhere (Technical Difficulty) resins, certain metals. But I think we've also been able to mitigate that in the first quarter to effectively a wash. Number of things that we do normal course from a cost management perspective, let alone going after price where we can. I think where we're seeing supply issues, particularly are in and around where we're seeing a little bit better growth, interestingly enough, not surprisingly.

Healthcare probably being number one renewables being the other again chips, resins and the like. I think right now, it's more isolated, or the nuisance would be maybe an understatement. But I think we're working through that and presumably have that captured in the guide that we're reiterating today. With respect to military, that's a little bit of a different challenge, right. That's not a price cost play, that's not a display -- a supply chain disruption issue, given the snapback. There are number of things that we need to do a better job of inside of our own facilities, we need help from our supply base there, so that we've got a smoother, more consistent flow into and out of -- into through and out of the manufacturing processes. So we're working on that, that's not going to be something that we declare victory on here in the second quarter. But rest assured, we're spending a lot of time working those issues with our customers in mind, first and foremost. So, hopefully that gives you a little bit of a color for what's happening operationally. These are the challenges when you get us, economic recovery and we're glad to see these challenges, because it suggests that, that better times are on the way.

Welcome.

Q - Nigel Coe{BIO 3818998 <GO>}
Okay, that's good news. I'm not sure (inaudible), thanks again. So, I want to ask a question on insurance, obviously GECAS is long way to sort of making the balance sheet, lot simpler. Insurance seems to be the next logical step and I'm wondering if some of the improvements we're seeing in claim experience, obviously more equity buffer there rising rates, whether that means that insurance is even close to being on the table at this point?

A - H. Lawrence Culp{BIO 1487306 <GO>}
Nigel, I would say that a number of those trends, clearly are encouraging and helpful here in the very near term. I'm not sure that we were quite ready today to suggest that all of that means that we could do something, along the strategic dimension with insurance. I think, we will continue to manage premium. I think we'll manage claims, let alone the investment portfolio, is thoughtfully as we can as long as that run-off liability is in our hands. But I do think that, given that the curves have more or less played out as we remodel them a few years back. Clearly, you've got the COVID effects, GE is in a very good place today. I'm optimistic, that we'll continue to explore strategic options in and around insurance and we'll see what happens. I don't want anyone to bank on that, is a dead surf [ph]. By the same token, I think what you've heard us say for some time, we're very keen, that the focus on our core for industrial businesses, insurance is not inside that perimeter. But, if and when we have an opportunity to do something smart, creative and strategic around insurance are rest assured, we'll give that our full attention.

Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski{BIO 16605674 <GO>}
Just, Larry, going back to a comment, I think you made on outlook about shop visits in Aviation and maybe not using that as a single point metric, that scope is also an important factor. Just given that, your comment earlier that Aviation is kind of an important swing factor in the second half. How are you seeing that scope or kind of dollar per shop visit evolve? Is that probably within your expectations? And any trend line there that we can point to that, say things are getting sort of better or worse as the world unfreezes?

A - H. Lawrence Culp{BIO 1487306 <GO>}
Well, I think the expectation, Josh, is that things will get better in terms of, not only, if you will, volume of shop visits but scope or the value of a shop visit. That said, there are different types of shop visits, right, some of which we perform, some of which we don't. I think, we've got better visibility clearly, when we're doing all the work, I think that is playing out as we would have anticipated. You all know, a number of cross currency pressures there in the short term as airlines battle COVID. We've got less visibility on the channel side of things. And I think we clearly see signs that over the last several quarters the number of our partners have brought inventory levels down, that doesn't necessarily mean a scope reduction on the part of the shop visit being performed, but it does have a knock-on effect, relative to the value for us in the very near term. But like any distribution or third-party related business, I've ever seen, you see those behaviors in the downturn, and then you get a lift off that base. And that is part of what I think we will see as part of what we are assuming, we will see, as we see the snapback and shop visits going forward. But that all needs to play out again number of encouraging signs in certain markets, the U.S. and China first amongst them. But clearly some signs in places like India, like the rest of Asia Pac, parts of Europe, that are of concern, and need to stabilize before they improve.

Q - Andrew Kaplowitz{BIO 15179203 <GO>}
Could you give us a little more color into how you're thinking about execution and healthcare? I know you said in your outlook call that you're only going to increase healthcare margin for the year by 25 to 75 basis points. But as you said, it's up 270 basis points organically. So did you, for instance, not increase R&D at as much as you thought. Are you seeing just better mix? And I know it's early, maybe a bit worried about supply chain, but could that margin forecast that you have in healthcare end up being quite conservative?

A - H. Lawrence Culp{BIO 1487306 <GO>}
Andy, I would say that credit to the team we have really three quarters here running, where despite a choppy somewhat unpredictable topline, given the pandemic. They've done a heck of a job on margins in cash, right. And I just think that is a function of the lot of the lean work we've talked about, that's probably our operating segment where we have pushed decentralization to furthest, to date. And I do think, we're seeing some early results there. There is no question that they've gotten off to a good start, right. Orders up 5%, let's remember though it's a bit of a dickens dynamic, right, two cities, pandemic related products, well off, where we were a year ago, but the core imaging and ultrasound franchises from an orders perspective are up over 20% year-on-year in the first quarter.

So it gives you a little bit of a sense of the play there, and that's really where precision health happens. With due respect, it's not ventilators and patient monitors have a role to play, but it really is in and around CT ultrasound and the core imaging products. I think as we go forward, while we're encouraged by the 270 bps, if we are getting a market's snapback, more than we would have anticipated. And if we see that being sustainable, in addition to the operating improvements we're going to make. I think what you'll see us do, Andy is, is frankly try to temper the margin expansion this year, and look to put more money back into the business. In no way does that suggest we not been funding those opportunities that we have wanted to, but you have to follow really the history, the last couple of years, right. We are prepping for an IPO, we pulled that off. So BioPharma, that's a distraction, getting back to basics, headlong into a pandemic. We're really I think getting in a calmer water in Healthcare, which gives us an opportunity.

Now, I think we're proving, we can deliver on margins in cash to drive growth, put more money into it, but make sure those are good investments, be it, in sales force additions, be it in digital, be it in new products, right. So, we're not going to pull that today, but don't be surprised if we continue to see good top and bottom line performance, that we call off some of the outsized margin improvements, so that we're putting that back into the business. Have a good '21, but also a good '22, a good '23, in a business that I think more people are going to appreciate as real value driver for GE going forward.

You guys talk a lot about lean, you talk about the turnaround, talk a little bit less about price. How -- and I guess just different in every business, I'm sure. But how are you going about changing kind of historic bidding process? And how big of a importance, I mean, I know you did mentioned price a few questions ago. But how important is price too, particularly net price to the turnaround and things like renewables?

A - H. Lawrence Culp{BIO 1487306 <GO>}
Well, in renewables, Scott, if we just focus there, when we talk about selectivity, that really is about price and margins. But also about terms and conditions, which I think up is really, if you will, risk that isn't necessarily model but can come back and course through and wreck the P&L, if we're not careful. So a good bit of what you see happening in Onshore Wind, and I think increasingly in Grid is a little less of an aggressive pursuit of the topline, with more of a balanced approach. To go after the business where we're well positioned, where we can serve and make a little bit of money, hopefully, a little bit more money over time. But also have a less -- have a better risk profile, right, to make sure that we're in the geographies, we're in the applications where we have higher confidence. So it's not price the way it is in Healthcare obviously. But if you go through our deal review process, think you would see that selectivity in those two areas in renewables and it's very much the same process we are driving across the organization.

Now there are plenty of things that we'll do in the short-term, price where we can surcharges a number of our long-term contracts across the company have inflation-based escalators in them, which helps us in environments like the one we made be play out here in the next couple of years. So we're really just again trying to pursue the quality business across the portfolio where we can serve the customer well, and do that in a way, that drives margins from cash for our investors.
