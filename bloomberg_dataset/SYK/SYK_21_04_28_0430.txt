Operator
Welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Christine, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, participants will have the opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question. (Operator Instructions) This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are also discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP, GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.

Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the Wright Medical integration. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A.

Despite the ongoing presence of the pandemic, we posted a strong quarter of organic sales growth of 4.7% versus Q1 2019. This was driven by outstanding international results, particularly in Asia-Pacific and the benefits of our diversified business model. Across our franchises, Mako, neurotech and medical had excellent performances, each posting strong double-digit growth versus 2019. At trend that we expect to continue for the remainder of the year in these businesses. Mako followed up a very strong Q4 with a banner Q1 performance, including an uptick in international installations.

As expected, elective procedures were negatively impacted to start the year, which had the largest impact on our hip and knee businesses. However, the trends improved progressively throughout the quarter with the US hip and knee accelerating in March and into April, where we are seeing mid single-digit growth as compared to April, 2019. We also saw improved growth in small capital within parts of neurotech and instruments during the quarter. In addition, our order book has picked up across our capital businesses, which is a good sign of pending growth as procedure volumes return to more normal levels. These trends give us confidence in achieving our guidance of 8% to 10% full-year organic sales growth compared to 2019, which is equivalent to 12% to 14% organic growth versus 2020, despite one less selling day.

While the press release shows our performance versus both 2020 and 2019, we believe that 2019 is a better reference point for comparison. Our momentum has continued regarding cost management and cash flow, and while spending will increase to support future growth, it will be done in a disciplined manner. Glenn will elaborate on our raised EPS guidance shortly.

We also published our first annual comprehensive report during the quarter, which captures our environmental, social and governance strategy, as well as commitments regarding our carbon footprint, diversity, equity and inclusion and supply chain transparency. We are encouraged by the progress we are making in these areas.

Overall, I am pleased with the strong start to the year and the momentum that is continuing to build. And while pandemic flash points are still occurring, we are well positioned to deliver growth at the high end of medtech with leveraged adjusted earnings.

I will now turn the call over to Preston.

Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on first quarter performance in our combined trauma and extremities business. An update on the ongoing integration of Wright Medical, and on our most recent acquisition activity. During the quarter, our combined trauma and extremities business showed good resiliency, growing 2.6%, including Wright Medical compared to 2019, despite the ongoing impacts of COVID restrictions during the quarter.

Our trauma business, which is less elective in nature benefited from inclement weather in the US and Europe in February. Performance in upper extremities and foot and ankle was driven by the recovery of elective procedures throughout the quarter along with lower than expected sales dis-synergies through the initial stages of the integration. As a result of the strong performance of our trauma and extremities business in the first quarter, we now expect the combined business to deliver mid single-digit growth for the full year when compared to 2019.

We remain encouraged with the progress and pace that the team has delivered with bringing the businesses together throughout the Wright Medical integration. As we have mentioned previously, we utilized the lengthy period from announce to close to build and resource the robust integration plans that we are now executing.

As we move through the quarter, our team has made progress against many key integration milestones. To date, the team has established three distinct business units with specialized commercial, R&D and selling organizations. We believe this dedication and focus will be a core driver of future growth across trauma, upper extremities and foot and ankle.

In addition to establishing dedicated business units, the team made considerable progress with our US sales integration, including the establishment of sales leadership, sales channel and territory alignment and identification of cross-selling priorities. Considerable progress has also been made on aligning the long-term portfolio in [ph] pipeline strategies.

Our focus on the integration will remain a key priority for the remainder of 2021, as we balance the complexity of the integration while minimizing sales disruption. Over the next few quarters, we will conclude the US commercial integration, including the initiation of cross-selling and we will kick off sales integrations across our international markets over the next several months.

Finally, our dedicated business development teams continue to identify and execute on tuck-in acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of TMJ Concepts, a medical device company that manufactures a patient-specific temporomandibular joint reconstruction prosthesis system. And our cranial maxillofacial business, personalized medicine plays a critical role. And the acquisition of TMJ Concepts supports their business strategy of driving category leadership through innovation and purpose of restoring form, function and hope to patients. These acquisitions continue to demonstrate our focus on our strategy of driving category leadership and market-leading growth.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn.

Glenn S. Boehnlein{BIO 19635076 <GO>}
Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and (Technical Difficulty). Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019, as it is more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020.

Our organic sales growth was 4.7% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q1 2019, and one less day than 2020. Compared to 2019, pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.4% versus Q1 2020 pricing was 0.9% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 1.3% impact on sales.

During the quarter, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related surgical procedure cancellation primarily in the US and Europe negatively impacted our sales. However, towards the end of the quarter, we did see improvements in sales momentum primarily in the US and our Asia-Pacific businesses. Also, as noted in the fourth quarter, demand for certain capital products continued as we saw strong results in our Mako and emergency care products.

For the quarter, US organic sales increased by 1%, reflecting the continuing slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the pandemic somewhat offset by strong demand for Mako, medical products and neurovascular products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 15%, impacted by positive sales momentum in China, Japan, Australia and Canada.

Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.93 increased 2.7% from 2019, reflecting sales growth partially offset by higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition, as well as an overall disciplined ramp up in operating costs. Our first quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.03.

Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 17.2% and organic sales decline of 0.7%, including an organic decline of 1.7% in the US. This reflects a slowdown in elective procedures related to COVID-19. Other ortho grew 49% in the US, primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement.

As noted previously, in March, we began to see good sales momentum in our US orthopedic businesses with all segments delivering positive organic growth as compared to '20 [ph] to March 2019. Internationally, Orthopaedics grew 1.5% organically, which reflects the COVID-19 related procedural slowdown in hips and knees especially in Europe offset by strong performances in Australia and Japan.

For the quarter, our Trauma and Extremities business, which includes Wright Medical delivered 2.6% growth on a comparable basis. This includes strong performances in US shoulder and US trauma. In the US, comparable growth was 4.4%. In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 5.3%, which included 1.6% growth in the US.

Instruments had a US organic sales decline of 3%, primarily impacted by continued procedural slowdown that impacted its power tool business, partially offset by gains in its waste management, smoke evacuation products and services business. As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2019, Instruments had a very strong growth of approximately 18%.

Endoscopy had a US organic sales decline of 5.7%, reflecting a slowdown in some of the capital businesses, which was partially offset by gains in our general surgery, video and sports medicine businesses, the latter of which grew over 11% in the quarter.

The Medical division had US organic sales growth of 13.6%, reflecting double-digit performance and it's emergency care and Sage businesses.

Internationally, MedSurg had an organic sales growth of 19.9%, reflecting strong growth across Europe, Canada, Australia and Japan in medical endoscopy and instruments.

Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency and organic growth of 12.8%. This growth reflects double-digit performances in our interventional spine, neurosurgical and ENT businesses and 27% growth in our neurovascular business.

Our US Neurotech business posted an organic growth of 12%, reflecting strong product growth in our neuro powered drills, Sonopet iQ, Bipolar Forceps, bioresorbables, and nasal implants. Additionally, within our US neurovascular business, we had significant growth in all product categories including hemorrhagic flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 31.7%. This performance was driven by strong demand in China and other emerging markets.

Now, I will focus on operating highlights for the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.4% was unfavorable approximately 40 basis points from our first quarter 2019. Compared to the first quarter in 2019, gross margin was primarily impacted by price, acquisitions and business mix.

Adjusted R&D spending was 6.8% of sales, reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our adjusted SG&A was 35.2% of sales, which was unfavorable to the first quarter of 2019 by 70 basis points.

In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 23.5% of sales, which is a 160 [ph] basis points decline over the first quarter of 2019. This reflects the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition combined with a disciplined ramp up in cost to fuel future growth, as well as the two-year compounding of certain cost given the comparison to 2019.

We also reiterate our operating margin expansion guidance of 30 basis points to 50 basis points improvement over 2019 operating margin, excluding the impact of Wright Medical. Related to other income and expenses compared to the first quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition.

Our first quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13%, given our mix of income. Given our current circumstances in the outlook for the full year, we would expect to be at the lower end of our range for the full year guided effective tax rate of 15.5% to 16.5%.

Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $2.3 billion of cash and marketable securities, and total debt of $13.1 billion. During the quarter, we repaid $715 million of maturing debt.

Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $450 million. This performance reflects the results of earnings, continued good management of working capital and approximately $170 million of one-time expenditures related to the Wright Medical integration.

Based on our first quarter performance and the current operating environment, we continue to expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%. We believe that the recovery ramp of electric procedures will continue to be variable based on region and geography and will continue into the second quarter of 2021.

As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for trauma and extremities to be in the mid single-digits for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. Net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by $0.05 to $0.10 in the full year,

And this is included in our revised guidance range.

Based on our first quarter performance and including consideration of our improved full year Wright Medical sales impact, disciplined cost management and continued positive recovery outlook, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.05 to $9.30.

And now I will open up the call for Q&A.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.

Q - Robert Marcus{BIO 18720787 <GO>}
Great. Congrats on a good quarter, and thanks for taking the question. So maybe, first, I'd start on the outlook. Kevin, you mentioned in the release in the script that March was much better than the rest of the quarter overall, with the most items in ortho growing in -- just growing in March. I was hoping you might give some early color or good way to how to frame second quarter here. Coming out of the fourth quarter call, the Street had a wide range and didn't really update through the quarters trends develop. So I was hoping maybe you could start off with giving some thoughts on where second quarter might shake out given the trends you're seeing here exiting first quarter? Thanks.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Hi, Robbie. First thing I would say is that we're not going to be providing quarterly guidance, but I can give you an indication of what's happening. We did indicate in my prepared remarks that US hip and knees is currently growing in the mid single-digits and that obviously was the business areas that were most impacted by the pandemic. So that recovery is pretty notable. If you look back in January and February where we were declining and we at the end -- by the end of March, we started to pull-ahead into positive territory and you can see that that's on the upswing. Difficult to predict with the flash points around the pandemic. But you can see, we feel very good about confirming the full year organic sales growth. So whether that occurs in April, May, June, July, parsing it by month is obviously very difficult.

The other thing that makes us very confident on the full-year outlook is the order book for capital equipment, both large capital and small capital, which is both picking up. So overall, we're feeling bullish. Obviously, growth has to accelerate to get a 10% organic when you start at 4.7% in the first quarter, but the exact pacing between Q2, Q3 and Q4 is so little uncertain.

Q - Robert Marcus{BIO 18720787 <GO>}
Great. That's really helpful. And maybe, Glenn. it seems like a lot of the $0.10 of dilution for Wright might have came in first quarter and earlier in the year, one, is that true? And second, any thoughts on, just as we straighten our models out here, I realize you're not giving guidance. But just how to think about the progression of EPS as we incorporate Wright Medical here and some of the comments on expense management you made on earlier in the call. Appreciate it.

A - Glenn S. Boehnlein{BIO 19635076 <GO>}
Yeah, Robbie, if you just think about the activities are going on related to the integration of Wright Medical, naturally, we would be working on cost synergies early in the year and incurring a lot of the costs that we need to incur relative to integrating Wright Medical, and as well as aligning our sales forces and all the things that Preston mentioned. And a lot of that did flow through in Q1 and I think that impact was certainly reflected in our EPS.

I think moving forward, as we think about it, we are optimistic about where we stand relative to sales dis-synergies [ph] and how that will play out for the remainder of the year. And some of the positivity was certainly reflected in our EPS guidance. And we fully expect that benefit will also contribute to sort of raising the guidance like we did.

And then as it relates to the cost management and how that will play out in the year. We are encouraging divisions to ramp up some of their spendings to make sure that we are properly positioned for growth, that would also include spending in innovation. And so we are making sure that we are not doing anything to hold back product development and other innovation spending that frankly will be needed to really fuel growth even towards the end of this year or even early into next year. So I think we'll see growth in that spending.

And then we did learn a lot from the experience that we went through and how we work. And so there are some benefits and savings that we fully expect to realize in the full year as it relates to primarily SG&A costs. So it's kind of a balance of those things that really get us to a lot of the confidence we had in raising our guidance.

Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.

Q - Vijay Kumar{BIO 17881836 <GO>}
Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. One, Glenn, back on the guidance question here is the assumptions here are back half perhaps we're looking at double-digit organic growth versus 2019. Is that a reasonable assumption just given how we're seeing procedures come back? In your commentary on mid singles growth in April, it seems that back half should be double-digit. Is that a reasonable assumption?

A - Glenn S. Boehnlein{BIO 19635076 <GO>}
Yeah, I think, Vijay, you could probably do the math as easily as I can. In terms of what it will take in the back half of the year to really get to the 8% to 10%, but, yeah, we do see accelerating growth and we'll see accelerating growth throughout Q2. In fact, underlying some of these assumptions is that Q2 has sort of a return to normalcy by the time we get to the end. And then we'll continue to see great growth in Q3 and Q4.

Q - Vijay Kumar{BIO 17881836 <GO>}
That's helpful. Kevin, one for you on that capital trends in the quarter. I think, I heard you say strong capital trends looking at the other line item within ortho, I mean, that is -- I mean, 45%, 50%, that's a big number. Is that -- was there any catch-up from last year, or what's driving? Any sense on how Mako placements are trending? is there an acceleration in the end market? Thank you.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Yeah, I just saw we had a terrific fourth quarter with Mako and that continued into the first quarter. So it was an absolute banner first quarter for Mako. And what we saw really was an acceleration in the international markets. The US continued its tremendous positive momentum. But we saw a real pickup. As you know, we received total new approval in some new markets towards the end of last year and we started to see those Mako installations happening in the first quarter. So it's really Mako around the world that was booming in the first quarter and that gives us a lot of optimism, because that's an early indicator of future implant growth.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.

Q - Pito Chickering{BIO 20828822 <GO>}
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Neurovascular was very strong this quarter. Can you give us some more color on what you think your end markets grew versus market share gains. Can you give us any color on sort of key products like the Atlas Stent or Surpass Flow Diverter? And also it's been growing very, very well in China, just curious what's driving that growth and how sustainable do you think that is?

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Hey, Pito. It's Preston. Just wanted to follow up with on your neurovascular question. I mean, I'd say, overall, we're really pleased with the double-digit growth. And I think certainly, as we've seen in the past that that market has been accelerating. But I do think that with some of those launches that you mentioned, we are seeing share gains in that space as well. So those launches that we had throughout 2020, we're really starting to capitalize as we've gotten into 2021. And so seeing good growth across a variety of those items including Flow Diverter and Stents and our aspiration products.

As it relates to China, again, same thing as we brought in technologies to those markets and been able to grow there similar to how we've done in our other markets with neurovascular. And so we really are looking forward to a strong year in total as you think about that neurovascular business.

Q - Pito Chickering{BIO 20828822 <GO>}
Okay. And then --

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
I just want to add -- can I just add one comment. I just think we have and it's really incredible leadership team of neurovascular. This is not just a one quarter wonder. I mean, they've been putting up tremendous numbers quarter-after-quarter. And as Preston said, the product cycle is really hitting beautifully across all of our categories. So this will be a very strong year.

Q - Pito Chickering{BIO 20828822 <GO>}
Yeah. Excellent. And it's a quick follow-up question. I think you referenced strength at the end of the quarter for US and Asia is obviously on easy comps. Can you give us any color of what you saw in the end markets in Europe in other key markets in March? Thanks so much.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Yeah. So just in terms of some of those other markets. I mean, I think as we know, Europe was a little bit behind in terms of some of the recovery. I mean, we saw some areas like the UK that might have been a little bit out in front. But certainly, as we saw the continued impacts on procedural volumes from the fourth quarter, we saw a similar impacts in Europe, really throughout the quarter. But similar to how we saw the US and some of those other areas, we did see improvements, as we ended the quarter. And so again as Glenn mentioned, our expectation as we go into second quarter is that we're getting back to more normalized levels. Of course, there are some other markets that are out there, like in Latin America and certainly India that will remain a little bit impacted by the coronavirus restrictions, et cetera. But as far as Europe and the US and especially Asia-Pacific, as we talk about there, we do expect those markets to get back to more normal levels.

Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. You may proceed.

Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen{BIO 7539249 <GO>}
Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just two big picture questions from me. One on ASCs. Kevin, J&J said that about 15% to 20% of hip and knee procedures now being done in ASCs. What are your thoughts on this trend? How are you positioning Stryker to tap into this shift? And I guess, everybody's concern is implications for implant pricing. And I had one follow-up.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Larry, I would say that 15% to 20% might be a little high. But there is no doubt that the trend is increasing and increasing pretty rapidly. We are delighted with the ASC offense that we put together really over the last two years, that we have a unique way that we go to the market for ASC and new sales organization that we created. And we really bring the best of Stryker because we have everything that they need in the ASC. We have guns, we have lights, we have power tools, we have Neptune Waste Management, we have operating cables, we have hips and knees and sports medicine and foot and ankle and shoulder and ACDF procedures for spine. So we really are a one-stop shop and makes life very easy for the ASC customer.

We are winning deals that are very, very large clip right now, which usually involve at least five of our business units, and last multiple years. And so we welcome the shift to the ASC. As of now, it's largely commercial pay that we're seeing those procedure are the ones moving to the ASC. So there really hasn't been much at all in the way of price pressure. Not to say that won't happen sometime in the future, but certainly for the next few years we don't see much in the way of price pressure and frankly, it's a tailwind for us just given our portfolio is really ideally suited and we've structured a very good offense to be able to sell to the ASC.

Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen{BIO 7539249 <GO>}
That's very helpful. And then, Kevin, on the backlog, how do you think about it? There's two analogs here, there's the PHYOX recall, which was a long time ago, but I think you were in the industry then. And then there was the financial crisis that took a couple of years to see a catch up there. Anybody can do the math in terms of how many patients deferred last year. How do you think about it? Do you think it will take -- it will come back quickly? Or do you think it will be protracted over years before we see those patients come back? Thanks for taking the questions.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Hey, Larry. Thanks for the question. As we think about the backlog, I think you're right. We will see that recovery happen and certainly if we go back a year now, that backlog has really been building over time. And while some surgeons have been able over the last several quarters to get back to doing procedures, it hasn't been at the rates that we would have expected pre-pandemic. And so as we get back to more normal periods, we expect that we'll see extra shift being put in or even some shifts in site of care to get procedures done and work through the backlog. But I would say that we're not expecting that we're going to see a significant or outsized growth in any one particular month or quarter. But you'll see rather a steady flow of elevated levels that will happen over the course of several quarters.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. You may proceed.

Q - Robert A. Hopkins{BIO 2150525 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks and good afternoon. In (inaudible) quarter, I mean, incredible strength in medical and neuro and versus 2019. But then, obviously, hips and knees versus 2019 down high single-digits. So I guess, I want to just focus there for a second. Kevin, did you say that current trends are up mid single-digits currently versus 2019? Is that what I heard you say?

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Yes. In the month of April, Bob, that's what we're seeing.

Q - Robert A. Hopkins{BIO 2150525 <GO>}
Okay. That's encouraging. And then into the guidance assumed for the year, the total company guide of 8% to 10% versus 2019. Is it roughly assumed that hips and knees are kind of in that ballpark as well?

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Yeah, I would say, Bob. As we think about that 8% to 10%, I mean, it's obviously all encompassing of all of our businesses and certainly we have some that are growing faster than others. What I would say is, we take where we landed in the first quarter, and then what Kevin saying about April, and what we would expect kind of as we go through second quarter and into the rest of the year. Certainly, we are expecting a return to more normalized levels. And if we just talk about the question with Larry around the backlog, I think we will see some elevated levels compared to kind of historical norms. And so I think if you take all those into account in context of that 8% to 10%, you can get a sense of where we think hips and knees are going to be.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. You may proceed.

Q - Matthew Miksic
Hi, thanks so much for taking the questions. Just one on the guidance and a follow-up on sort of the pipeline and some of the investments you're making. So just to talk a little bit about the EPS raise a bit more. Curious if it's --it sounds like part of that is confidence in returning to growth on the topline. And I'm just wondering if that's the case, why not take up the topline guide slightly? And as I mentioned, and one follow-up.

A - Glenn S. Boehnlein{BIO 19635076 <GO>}
Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Well, first of all, we're just through the first quarter. And so there's lots of twists and turns here in the next three quarters. I would say that the fundamental thing on the guidance, a couple of thing is that it boils down to a lot of the optimism that we're seeing around many of our current businesses. We're definitely not unhappy at all with our Q1 earnings performance or Q1 topline performance. And so I do think that as we accelerated through the quarter and what we're seeing in April, we feel pretty good about our prospects for the remainder of the year. Kevin referenced, our order books which are certainly a good indicator of where future sales could land. So we just feel like there is very solid momentum across many, many of our businesses. We also have strong under pinned of disciplined cost, which is going to help EPS. And I just think that all of that combined with also the progress that we're making on Wright Medical just gives us the confidence that we felt like we should raise our guidance, which is why we did it.

Q - Matthew Miksic
Got it. Thank you, and that's helpful. Then just you mentioned also in the operating margin sort of puts and takes that you had sort of continued your disciplined investment, and I think you said innovation and growth programs, which I think many investors appreciate. I'm wondering if you could maybe put a finer point on that in terms of basis points. And then also maybe more importantly, talk a little bit about what the first or second most important near term project or program is in that stack of innovation that we might see say later in the year or next year?

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Hey, Matt, I think if you look at in terms of investment as we think about the quarter in particular and even as we go forward, now you can probably just look at the rate percentage of sales in terms of the investments that we've made in R&D this quarter compared to previous quarters. And you'll see that it's been elevated over our historical norms, which is, I think what Glenn is referencing in terms of additional investments and making sure that we're being disciplined about how we spend against innovation and in our R&D platforms. As it relates to future projects, I mean, the part of the beauty of our model is that the decentralized nature of it allows each of our business units really to focus in on those projects that are important to them as they try for growth as we go forward. And so really that innovation in that investments being made across all of our businesses. And as we have items that makes sense to talk about in this type of forum will certainly do so in terms of new launches and key product innovations that will be coming to market in the future.

Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. You may proceed.

Q - Joanne Wuensch{BIO 2379289 <GO>}
Thank you for taking the question, and good afternoon. Two questions, put them [ph] right at front. What are your debt goals or debt pay down goals? I'm not sure how you're measuring it whether it is sort of that EBITDA metric over certain period of time or net debt that you are aiming towards. And then on Wright Medical, if I see it correctly, that's integrating somewhat faster than expected and I'd be curious to what you see as sort of a surprise in administration [ph]? Thank you.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Hi, Joanne. In terms of debt pay down goals and we've been pretty clear with the rating agencies on this as well. We really look at debt-to-EBITDA as the ratio that we focus on and really bring it back down to kind of what are our historical levels, 2.5 times roughly. If you think about the next couple of years, it means a pay-down of $2 billion plus in terms of what we'll do. We -- if you think about what we paid off in the fourth quarter and what we paid off this quarter were about $1 billion towards that goal. We probably have an opportunity to pay down a little more debt this year that will take advantage of too [ph]. And so that's what we think we'll land. Once we do that we think will be in a solid territory to sort of accelerate our programs around looking at sort of larger opportunities, but the organization is very focused on cash flow and reaching those debt pay down goals.

A - Glenn S. Boehnlein{BIO 19635076 <GO>}
Then maybe I'll take the question on Wright Medical. I would say we're off to a very good start. So far so very good. With the Wright Medical integration, it's proceeding much more quickly than K2M, which was our first overlap deal. And I would say, I'm delighted with the products, the people and the pipeline that we've acquired with Wright Medical. And really if I just think back to all the deals we've done in recent history, maybe NOVADAQ is the only other deal I would say that's kind of in the same ballpark as this one in terms of the speed of integration, the speed of decision making. We have mixed management teams that are leading a lot of the Wright Medical leadership has come over, certain key leadership roles and the momentum is terrific. And we had baked in a certain level of dis-synergies. And even on the cost side, I think we're making progress a little bit more quickly than we had expected. So overall, delighted with where we are at Wright Medical and the future is very bright.

Q - Ryan Zimmerman{BIO 20228112 <GO>}
Great. Thank you for taking my question. So I want to ask first about the US Spine market and you flap [ph] now the K2M acquisition. And so if you comment on kind of your assessment of your Spine franchise and your expectations for getting back to market growth in that business? And then my second question is just around, you call out the Sage business, and it seems like it was very strong this quarter and medical. And so is there some dynamic of kind of pantry reloading and the expectation that procedures could be picking up sooner? And just how to think about that cadence within that business going forward? Thank you.

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Hey, Ryan. It's Preston, and I'll take both of those questions. From a Spine perspective, I think overall, we're very encouraged by the performance that we've seen in our Spine business in the last several quarters. Certainly it's been enhanced by enabling technologies, certainly our recent acquisition of Mobius being a part of that. And I think the other thing I would just point out to you, as we think about Spine in relation to some of the other implant businesses, we certainly didn't see the same level of impact as a result of the COVID restrictions, particularly across this last quarter, like we saw in some of the other implant businesses. So just something to keep in mind as you think about the performance. But overall, like I said, we're encouraged by the performance and we're with high expectations in terms of our Spine business getting back to market levels and continuing to perform that way.

As it relates to Sage, I think you hit it. I mean, really it's a product that certainly was impacted by the procedure slowdowns. And so as hospitals ramp back up and get ready for that, the procedures to pick back up. There is an element of Sage that will pick back up in terms of stocking to get ready. But at the same time, I think you also begin to see the flow through that's happening from a Sage perspective as well as more and more procedures are done in that catch-up of the recovery process.

Q - Ryan Zimmerman{BIO 20228112 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my questions.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Kevin, I'd just like to add one comment. I think our medical business sometimes gets a little underestimated and the reason is, you have three different components of it. You have the acute care, the beds and structures. And we have a brand new bed ProCuity that was launched towards the end of last year, that will have four models. Two of those models will be launched a little later this year, that will drive very strong growth for that business. And then you have the emergency care, which is the defibrillators and the strict ambulance costs, and then you have the Sage business. And so you have three different businesses that frankly had -- last year you had a little bit more contribution from acute care and emergency care and not so much from Sage. This year, you're going to have a lot more Sage, emergency care is going well and acute care should pick up as we get into the latter quarters of this year. So overall, it really is a much more stable high-growth business than it was a decade ago, based on the acquisitions of Physio-Control and Sage.

Q - Chris Pasquale{BIO 16420761 <GO>}
Thanks for taking the questions. Glenn, one quick one for you, and then one on the businesses. I just wanted to confirm with the guidance, how much of the change in EPS guidance was related to change in expectations for currency versus operational performance? It wasn't clear to me what the components were there.

A - Glenn S. Boehnlein{BIO 19635076 <GO>}
Yeah, Chris, we basically incurred some positivity of $0.03 in Q1, and we think the full year will have an impact of $0.05 to $0.10. Just there is still some variability out there. So that's what we guided here.

Q - Chris Pasquale{BIO 16420761 <GO>}
And I guess, relative to the original guidance, was there a delta there or is that the same as you were expecting with the original EPS range?

A - Glenn S. Boehnlein{BIO 19635076 <GO>}
There is a -- really it's wordsmithing, I mean the original guidance, we thought it would be a dime, affirm $0.10, and now we're sort of more thinking that we might see a range of $0.05 to $0.10.

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. You may proceed.

Q - Anthony Petrone{BIO 6789431 <GO>}
Hi, thanks. Maybe just a couple of questions, one on robotics, one on Wright Medical. On robotics, just trying to get a sense of sort of the competitive landscape, we're hearing quite a bit about the J&J VELYS robot launch here pending. And so just wondering if there is any sort of impact in the 1Q numbers, perhaps a bigger selling effort ahead of a competitive launch?

And then secondly on Wright, when we think about sort of settling at mid single-digit growth, pre-acquisition that was a high single-digit growth there. I'm just wondering if we can sort of break that out between dis-synergy and pandemic and sort what is the timing to get back to that high single-digit growth rate? Thanks a lot.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Yeah. So with regards to your question on robotics, I mean, from our perspective really nothing has changed in our focus. And what you saw in the first quarter really is just a continuation of the effort that we had since we launched Mako. And so we're really seeing the uptick as a result of just selling in our technology. And overall, we really remain bullish about Mako and what it brings other competitive systems like VELYS or ROSA haven't slowed us down at all. And if anything, what they've done, they've increased the validation that robotics are here today. And really demand for Mako and our technology continues to be super strong as we saw by the results we posted. And then also, we believe we have the best solution. And so from a head-to-head comparison is something that we look forward to with the technologies that are on the market today.

As you think about Wright Medical, and again, the high single-digits, I mean it's all inclusive in there. Obviously, we're coming off of the pandemic are still kind of coming out at the end of the pandemic, so there's certainly some impact there. There are dis-synergies that are associated with the deal itself. And then there's also just the integration happening has been in terms of the Wright business and our own business through cross-selling the things like that. So it's not something that we've parsed out in terms of the different components of it, I think what we can expect to see is that as we work through the integration, we will get our total trauma and extremities business back up to performing above market growth.

Q - Anthony Petrone{BIO 6789431 <GO>}
Thanks a lot.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
The key thing to remember the mid single-digit growth that includes our existing trauma business. So that wasn't just for the Wright Medical portion, right. That's the combined trauma and extremities. And so Wright Medical will be a faster growing components of the combined trauma and extremities business, but obviously wasn't in the first quarter just because of the pandemic.

Q - Anthony Petrone{BIO 6789431 <GO>}

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. You may proceed.

Q - Steven M. Lichtman{BIO 6016198 <GO>}
Thank you. Hi guys. First question, I know you haven't been providing Mako mean numbers in recent quarters. I was wondering if you could give us your perspective on where the US market penetration is today. Any color you could provide where you think we're at penetration wise from a procedure replacement perspective, from a market perspective would be really helpful?

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, obviously, we're not providing specifics on the quarter. But I think if you go back and look at what we said in the fourth quarter, that will give you some sense of where we are in total installation base, both from a US or global perspective. And you can make some assumptions about what that might mean US versus international. But if you think about what that total placement is and you think about the fact that there is the potential for 4,500 or so hospitals that could carry a Mako, that just give you a sense of where we are penetration wise, but even then I would tell you that many of these hospitals are able to take more than just one. So I'll take the bottom line with all of that is, it's still early days in terms of penetration. So there's a lot of opportunity out there in terms of robotics and taking Mako and taking more than one Mako go as we go forward.

Q - Steven M. Lichtman{BIO 6016198 <GO>}
Got it. And Glenn, you mentioned relative to Wright, obviously, integration going better and you're up. The topline is part of the operating margin confidence, also some pull forward of the expense synergies that you were expecting or is that still yet to come as well?

A - Glenn S. Boehnlein{BIO 19635076 <GO>}
Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment. We are executing very well on the cost synergies that were planned in our modeling, and so we are going to see a little bit of that favorability that's flowing through the revised guidance.

Your next question comes from the line of Drew Ranieri from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.

Q - Drew Ranieri{BIO 18070119 <GO>}
Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, you called out strong China results in the quarter. Could you just maybe talk a little bit in more detail about what you're seeing now over the next 12 months and what your expectations are moving through 2021? And just sticking with APAC for a second, kind of what's your enthusiasm for Mako in China in Japan? Is 2021 an inflection year for these countries or should we see more gradual adoption in the near term?

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Yeah. So first of all, China had a terrific first quarter. As you know, the pandemic is not really affecting day-to-day life in China. And they had a very, obviously, in 2019 -- even going back to 2019, we had terrific growth. But obviously, last year was very badly impacted in the first quarter if you compare to 2020. So China as a whole, we're very small in China relative to other companies. But we grew incredibly fast and very, very high double-digit growth in Q1. The outlook for China for us is still very positive given our lower relative market shares, it will be a very good Mako market, we're just getting started in China.

I would say, Japan and certainly Australia is farther ahead of where we are in China. So it's early days, but very promising, very encouraging. The one negative for China, of course is this trend towards volume based procurement, which you've seen in the cardiac stents and we know that that's going to come down the pipe in effect a couple of our businesses hasn't yet, but really starting to, and there will be noise around that. But overall, China for us still remains a high priority market and will be a growth market for us just given our relative position. But even as it relates to Mako that, that will be carved out of the tendering related to volume-based procurement. So we still have a significant runway for robotics both in Japan and China. Those are going to both big markets. And we're very excited about our progress in both of those.

Q - Drew Ranieri{BIO 18070119 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you. And just a question for Glenn. Glenn, you mentioned momentum continues for cash flow, but could you just give us some more color on your efforts to drive the cash flow kind of those discretionary expenses come back? Just how is Stryker focused on cash flow generation today, maybe first 12, 24 months ago? Thank you.

A - Glenn S. Boehnlein{BIO 19635076 <GO>}
Yeah. I think one of the things that we got the whole organization garnered around over the course of 2020 was just the importance of cash flow, and good management of that cash flow, just so we could operate the company at reduced revenue levels. But then also just so we could reallocate that cash flow to areas that provide better returns in terms of M&A and things like that. So I do think organizationally we are well positioned relative to manage cash flow. We have efforts ongoing in terms of moving a lot more of our collections to standardize shared service centers. We have efforts in inventory management and working very closely with the businesses, so that we can forecast inventory needs better.

We also look at distribution strategies that sort of are more efficient in terms of how much inventory we have on hand to serve customers. And then lastly, we are also working with our vendors in terms of accounts payable and how do we have more favorable terms in terms of payment terms on accounts payable. So all of that is just really tightening up our working capital certainly will benefit us this year as we look at improving the results of cash flow.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. You may proceed.

Q - Matthew Taylor{BIO 16863940 <GO>}
Hi, and thank you for taking the question. So I wanted to ask about your guidance last quarter, you were asked about what the swing factor was between the high and the low end. And you said is basically a big one was how quickly things come back in Q2, if they came back better on the front end, you could be near the high end and on the back end, near the low end, if that makes sense. So is that still how you're thinking about it, based on the trends that you're seeing is that leading you towards the high or the low end of guidance for the year?

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Thanks, Matt. So if you think about it. Again, we provided the range because of the variability that exists. And certainly, as we think about where we're headed, we're happy with what happened in the first quarter. And as we, with the momentum that we're taking into the second quarter and certainly if we continue to have great momentum, obviously, it means a good thing for us as we think about our overall sales. But we put the guidance range out there for exactly that reason, because there's still a lot of variability that's happening across the different marketplaces. So I think that's how I would think about it. And certainly as we come into our second quarter results, we will have another update that we'll be able to talk about that.

Q - Matthew Taylor{BIO 16863940 <GO>}
Okay. And then you mentioned a couple of times, you've got a strong order book, which is a good sign. I was hoping you could characterize that for us a little bit better in terms of maybe in the percentage of your sales that impact directly or indirectly? Could you talk about it as a indicator for implants and just kind of the timing of that? When does that start to land and how long does it last and help us think about how that impacts the forecast?

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Yeah. So I think when we talk about our order book, generally, it's referenced as we think about our capital businesses, because those items are being placed. In some cases, well in advance as we think about our larger capital items or even the smaller capital items, the orders that are coming in there. So it's just a leading indicator as we look at those businesses and so really when we talk about capital, we talked about capital before as being about 15% or so being our personal capital and about 9% or 10% being our large capital items, as we think about it as a percent of our total business. So I think if you think about the both items, those are the ones that we're talking about when we reference our order book in generally is impacting those 25% or so percent of our business. And again it's just a leading indicator as we think about return of procedures, and also just the strength of our customers in terms of the financial position as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Matson from Needham and Company. You may proceed.

Q - Mike Matson{BIO 7458491 <GO>}
Hi, I wanted to ask one on M&A, after we did the Wright acquisition, we really haven't seen as many deals. And there was a pandemic last year. So it's probably not too surprising given everything that's going on. But how do you kind of balance the need to digest the Wright deal integrate that company with Stryker versus the funnel for M&A and just the valuations on some of these companies out there now?

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Yeah. A good question. And as we talked about when we did the right deal. Obviously, with the largest deal in our history. And so one of the things we talked about is while we go through the integration of Wright, then we would continue to focus on M&A, but the focus that we'll have on M&A will be more of a tuck-in variety. So as we've looked at, at placing either smaller products are more technologies into our existing businesses. And so we go back to the end of the year, we have the Ortho Sensor acquisition, and then we just talked about today, the TMJ Concepts acquisition. So you'll continue to see those types of acquisitions in the near term as we continue to go through the integration of Wright in terms of debt pay down that we've talked about as well. So I think that's how I would think about acquisitions for us as we think about going forward. And I think one key point is that we're always looking, we have dedicated business development teams as part of our commercial business units and they're always out there, evaluating the landscape and looking at targets, so that whenever the opportunity presents itself that we're able to take advantage of it.

Q - Mike Matson{BIO 7458491 <GO>}
Okay, thanks. And then, just wanted to ask one on Spine. So you had good growth there in the Spine business, and I would suspect you probably out performing the market, but do you have any sense for the degree to which that market was affected by the procedural slowdown in the first quarter, early part of the first quarter as opposed to the hip and knee market?

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Yeah. So as we think about Spine, the only thing that we can look at is what's happened over the last several quarters. And I think what we see with Spine even as we look at our own business is that it's not as impacted. I mean, it certainly is impacted as there is elective components of it. But it's generally more emergent as we think about Spine versus another -- hip and knee business for example. And so we haven't seen the same level of slowdown. As we think about where that lands written regards to the total market, I think as we come through the pandemic, it's just something we're going to have to continue to evaluate once we get into a more normalized setting.

Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter from SVB Leerink. You may proceed.

Q - Richard Newitter{BIO 16908179 <GO>}
Just first, Kevin, you mentioned the mid single-digit trajectory relative to '19 for hips and knees. Those are different businesses with different deferral characteristics throughout COVID and they also have different comps in the 2019 period. So I was just curious, should we be thinking of knees as being substantially higher than that mid single-digits? And maybe hips drag that down to an average of mid single-digits. I'm just trying to get a sense of difference between the two categories, especially given where the backlog is coming?

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Yeah, so first of all, I don't want to get too carried away with one month of comp, right. It's a very positive sign. Both are in the mid-single digit range. And I'm not going to sort of say which is higher than the other one. They both are doing mid single-digit growth versus April of last year. But again, we're talking about 25 days, selling days roughly between two years apart. And so it's definitely a change from the trajectory we saw in the first three months of the year and a positive change. But I don't want to get excited about that. It's just an indication of data point for you that tells you things are improving, volumes are coming back, but it's not really provide a new guidance with which hips and knees, which one is going to be performing better than the other one. They're both coming back and that's a good sign overall.

Q - Richard Newitter{BIO 16908179 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up, you mentioned some dynamic in Spine relative to the recovery January to March. Could you talk a little bit about some of your other electives in nature procedure areas like sports medicine, maybe ENT, and just talk a little bit about what the recovery is looking like there and prospects for the back half? Thanks.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Yeah. So those are actually recovering very well. At sports medicine, I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks grew double-digits in the first quarter and it actually grew double-digits in the fourth quarter last year. So we're delighted when those procedures are done in surgery centers where you frankly haven't seen the same degree of slowdown as you have in the inpatient hospital. ENT was the most negatively impacted when the pandemic started, because of the aero-slicing [ph] procedures. We're seeing that have a nice rebound. And so both of those areas are going to be strong performers and strong contributors to grow in 2021.

Your next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum from Truist Securities. You may proceed.

Q - Kaila Krum{BIO 19222021 <GO>}
Great. Hi, thanks for taking our questions. So, can you speak a little bit and a little bit more detail about the TMJ Concepts acquisition, you mentioned on the call, just the rationale how important or significant that could be? Just any additional detail there would be helpful.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Sure. As we think about that acquisition, and again it fits the overall strategy that we have in terms of finding products and technologies that are out there and really fitting them into our salesforce's hands to help them really go out and serve the surgeons and the customers and patients that they serve. So with TMJ Concepts, really it's adding that TMJ prostheses products to the bag, that's allowing us to go and really service customers and patients that are actually in that position of needing that replacement.

A - Glenn S. Boehnlein{BIO 19635076 <GO>}
But I would say, overall, it's a very small deal, so this is not something that's going to really hit your radar screen for the overall size of Stryker. It's very meaningful to our CMF business, very meaningful to the oral maxillofacial surgeons, but not a big mover on the needle for overall, Stryker.and so you'll see that as we report our results, we'll report that in the acquisition column you'll be able to see that. But it's very small, nothing that's going to be really meaningful to the overall Stryker.

Q - Kaila Krum{BIO 19222021 <GO>}
Got it. Okay, helpful. And then just high level, Kevin, I love to just hear what you're hearing from your hospital customers in recent months. I mean, you mentioned, you're seeing more of a shift to ASCs. Are there any other sort of interesting trends in the market you're hearing about that have surprised you, either to the positive or negative in recent dialog with your customers? Thank you.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Nothing. I wouldn't say surprising, Kaila. But I would say is that the shift to the ASC, every hospital you speak to has programs underway, and so that was already happening prior to the pandemic. It is definitely accelerating. That's probably the most notable thing I would say. The other thing is that they're are actually in pretty good financial position. So unlike prior crisis that we've gone through, whether it was the financial meltdown or other issues, now the hospital liquidity is actually very good. And so there was a pause for a little while on some of the capital, certainly the smaller capital but as procedures are coming back, we're seeing that through our order book, but hospitals are in actually very good financial position and better than frankly I would have expected when the pandemic first hit.

Your next question comes from the line is Jeff Johnson from Baird. You may proceed.

Q - Jeffrey D. Johnson{BIO 15231998 <GO>}
Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Two just clarifying questions if I could. Preston, you were talking about the Spine market and good to hear that it's a little more emergent maybe not as pressured as much in 1Q is the hip and knee market. But I'm assuming the pass through payments on SpineJack

Helped a decent amount in 1Q. So when I look at you're down 2% US Spine versus the down 7%, 8% US hip and knee, is that about the right way to think about a six point differential on core spine versus hip and knee market growth at this point? Or would that differential be less than that if we kind of exclude some of those benefits? I'm assuming you've got on the interventional side.

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, I think it's again being that we're right in the middle of the pandemic, there's lot of regional variability with this. I mean, I think any -- to take any number in absolute is probably not the right bet. But I think certainly there is that gap there that driven by that less emergence impact, if you think about hips and knees versus spine. So, I mean, I think if you take some gap in that small single-digit range, that's probably about right.

Q - Jeffrey D. Johnson{BIO 15231998 <GO>}
All right, fair enough. And Kevin, I found it interesting your comments on the ASCs in the five business units typically being involved in a contract, I think historically, and correct me if I'm wrong, but historically you said there's not a lot of bundling that those out at the hospital level, cross business units, things like that at this point. Obviously, in the ASCs that seems to be happening more. Does that mean your incremental share gains at ASC should be even greater than what we've seen historically on the hospital side for you guys? It just seems like you're so well positioned there given the diversification of the business model.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Yeah, it's a great point. There is a very different buying that occurs at the ASC than it does in the hospital. The hospitals have very elaborate procurement divisions and departments and they buy by service line and it's very decentralized. The ASC is a very simple sort of customer that you have to interact with. They're not as many people. They can't perceive 22 Stryker sales people. They don't want to, and that's not the way they want to do business. So we have a different offense for the ASC. And fortunately, we have a portfolio for the orthopedic ASC, which includes sports that is just perfect for what they're looking for.

And so, yes, we've adapted our offense. We have the portfolio, but it is a very different buying pattern. The hospital isn't as interested frankly and looking across our different divisions and hasn't historically been as interested, but the ASC customers certainly is. And the good news is we've adapted our offense. If we had continued with our -- the same way we used to sell, we wouldn't be having the success that we're having now. And really I'm optimistic about this continuing in the future.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien from Piper Sandler. You may proceed.

Q - Korinne Wolfmeyer{BIO 21501659 <GO>}
Hi, this is Korinne on for Matt. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one quick one for us. Can you talk a little bit about how Mako hip is going and how you expect it to perform for the remainder of the year?

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Yes, sure. So the Mako hip application if you remember, we launched it last year, but we really couldn't get it out to all of our customers because of pandemic. We've got roughly 50%, maybe a little bit more than 50% of the accounts have the new software, so it's not as simple as just sort of doing an upload over the web of the software. We actually have to go to the account, put the software on and do it in servicing with our customers because there is new information they have to learn. So there's actually a training regimen that goes with it. So, right now, we're excited about the procedure growth in hip is increasing as more and more accounts have the software installed and are in serviced by our Stryker team.

This will continue through the second quarter, probably through a good part of the third quarter before all of the accounts have the new hip software, but the feedback from the surgeon customer is terrific. There's -- it takes less time to register, so that speeds up the overall procedure time. And there is some very valuable information such as pelvic tilt, but surgeons find that very beneficial to make sure they're managing like length discrepancies. And so, the feedback again very positive, but we're still in the throes of this implementation and it does take time because it requires that that high touch in servicing and due to the pandemic we haven't been able to move as quickly as we would like in all of our accounts and all of our regions.

Your next question comes from the line is Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.

Q - Joshua T. Jennings{BIO 16451037 <GO>}
Kevin, just two questions on the knee business. First just, you've had unprecedented success with your strategy of pairing robotics with the triathlon implant. Do you see any knee now that -- the other three of the big four have introduced robotic platforms to pivot from that strategy and how do you see implants evolving from here, the implants the robotics era? And then the second question is just -- sorry, the ASC question, but for knees, are you overrepresented in the ASCs? That's our assumption just wanted to sanity check that, do you have a higher share at ASCs than the rest of the US? And you just received approval for patient specific instrumentation for the triathlon. And can you help us to understand how that improves your competitive positioning, particularly in ASCs? Thanks for taking the questions.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Okay, great. There are a few questions in there, so I'll try to cover them all. So, first of all, the ASC is an area that we welcome. We're having success with Mako, frankly, in the ASC, more success than I would have imagined, honestly, two years ago when we initially signed the deal with Conformis. That deal was designed to really have a very simple solution for the ASC customer that is not using Mako. And there will be ASCs, the deals -- some of the deals we've won don't involve a Mako where they will use manual procedures. That's where this solution will be terrific because it requires much less sterilization and is really custom designed for the ASC. So, we're excited to get that FDA approval and we look forward to being able to offer that to our ASC customers. I think you asked about market share. I don't know, Preston, do you have a feel for whether we're over-indexed in ASCs? I think it's fairly representative at this point.

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Yeah, I think it's fairly representative at this point. I mean, obviously, it's a growing segment, but I think that are representative right now.

A - Kevin A. Lobo{BIO 15125389 <GO>}
Yeah, and it's still early, but we like our chances of being able to do very well. And as it relates to the implants, I would tell you in the short-term no real need to change anything. We're going to continue to have high -- high adoption of robotics. We have cementless that continues to grow as we talked about in the fourth quarter, over 40% of our knees are cementless, but that still has a long runway to go. Longer-term, I do think of different types of implants that are more bone sparing that don't use plain [ph] or cuts, but those will require IDE trials. But it's that I think something that is able to keep the ACL in place, it is something -- is an area that we're exploring more from a science standpoint. So nothing that'd be launched imminently, but I do think that will be the future is new kinds of implants that are thinner, that are occurred that only a robot will be able to -- to be able to implement into a patient. So that's kind of the longer-term future, but in the near-term, let's say call it the next two, three years, I think we're very pleased with the portfolio we have and a long runway for continued growth.

Q - Joshua T. Jennings{BIO 16451037 <GO>}
Thanks a lot.
