Welcome to the Third Quarter 2021 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Maddy, and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions).

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin, sir.

Kevin Lobo{BIO 22113385 <GO>}
Thank you. Welcome to Stryker's Third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the trends we saw during the quarter. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. For the quarter, we posted organic sales growth of 8.4% versus 2019. Driven by excellent double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, but this was offset by softer sales of hips, knees and Spine due to the resurgence of COVID 19.

The slowdown in deferrable procedures primarily impacted the US and worsened through the quarter. While our implant businesses were challenged, we saw strong results for our Mako robotic technology and capital products across our MedSurg portfolio. In addition, we had strong performances from our more emergent businesses, including our core Trauma business and another standout performance by Neurovascular. International organic growth of 12% again outpaced growth in the US representing robust performances and lessening impacts of COVID-19 across most major geographies, including strong results across Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets.

Our year-to-date organic growth of 7.6% and with the continued uncertainty related to COVID recovery, as well as healthcare staffing shortages, we are updating our full-year organic sales growth guidance to 7% to 8% compared to 2019. Our capital or equipment order book remains strong, and we are well positioned for the eventual procedure recovery. Our adjusted EPS grew 15% versus 2019. And we continued our focus on driving cash flow leading to a year-to-date cash conversion of 87%. The EPS growth although solid was lower than our expectations and this reflected in our updated guidance, which Glenn will elaborate on. Meanwhile, we are pleased with our cash flow performance which provides us with additional flexibility for future M&A opportunities. While the quarter did not progress as we had anticipated due to the Delta variant, we remain confident in the outlook for our businesses as evidenced by our strong international MedSurg and Neurotechnology performances.

We expect these businesses to continue to perform at high levels with the uncertainty most concentrated in deferrable procedures in the United States. We continue to feel bullish about our longer-term prospects as the pandemic recedes with our proven strategy and strong fundamentals. We are excited to share more with you at our upcoming Analyst Day on November 18.

I will now turn the call over to Preston.

Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing additional insights into the current environment including how certain products and geographies performed during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on the continued integration of Wright Medical, including the performance of our combined Trauma and Extremities business. During the quarter, significant spikes of the COVID Delta variant drove increased infections and hospitalizations that required higher hospital bed utilization, which ultimately led to the deferral of elective procedures. In addition to increased hospitalization hospital staffing shortages also pressured procedural volumes throughout the quarter. This primarily impacted our implant related businesses including hips, knees and spine, which can be in many cases deferred for a period of time.

However, the disease state that we treat are degenerative and the patients that deferred their procedures will eventually return to have those procedures completed. The impact on elective procedures was more pronounced in the United States than on other geographies outside the United States. Within the United States, there were areas of disruption in most states, but disruption was more widespread in the Southeast and Southwest portions of the country impacting major markets like Florida and Texas throughout the quarter. Other markets around the world, including China, Japan and Australia experienced intermittent lockdowns throughout the quarter, which also drove uneven results across our implant related businesses in those markets. During the quarter, Europe which was more impacted by COVID in previous quarters had impressive organic growth compared to 2019.

COVID related hospitalizations in the United States began to trend upwards towards the end of July and then progressively worsened peaking at the beginning of September at the end of the quarter infection and hospitalization rates were declining and impacted regions and has continued into October. As a result, we are beginning to see some improvements in our more impacted businesses through the first weeks of -- few weeks of October. However, we expect the recovery will be partially muted by the continued hospital staffing challenges and ongoing COVID related volatility. Our assumption for the fourth quarter is that deferrable procedures will gradually return starting with a low base in October before returning to more normal levels by the end of the quarter.

As a result, we expect that the fourth quarter growth rates for our more deferrable businesses will be similar to the third quarter. Despite the ongoing challenges with elective procedures, we had strong performances in our more emerging businesses like Neurovascular which grew strong double digits compared to 2019 as a result of continued market expansion and ongoing global demand for our innovative technology. In addition, demand for our capital equipment remains healthy as evidenced by our continued strong sales performance and robust order book for small and large capital products, including our surgical technologies, emergency care and neurosurgical businesses. The ongoing strength in capital is also reflected in the continued demand for our Mako robotic technology. Our industry leading Mako robot continues to help surgeons improve patient outcomes by knowing more and cutting less. This trend across capital is expected to continue as hospitals take advantage of flexible financing and prioritize capital products like those within our portfolio that are critical to providing emergency care driving profitable procedures and ensuring safe working environments for caregivers and patients.

Turning to the Wright Medical integration, which continues to progress in all regions and functions, the United States commercial integration has moved past the sales force realignment and is now focused on continued business process improvement and system efficiencies. The teams have also developed long-term product pipeline strategy. Outside the United States, we continue to work through integration activities including sales force and indirect channel alignment across all key geographic regions. Overall, we remain pleased with the progress in the pace of integration over the past year.

Including Wright Medical, the combined US Trauma and Extremities business has grown 8.1% year-to-date. The year-to-date growth in the United States has been driven by strong double-digit growth in both our core Trauma and Upper Extremities businesses reflecting the execution of the sales integration in the United States. Outside the United States sales have declined 3.8% year-to-date driven by timing of distributor conversions in Latin America and Asia-Pacific and declines in our legacy trust in trauma business in China as a result of the provincial tendering process. Considering the latest results, ongoing COVID-related volatility and the provincial tenders in China, we now expect our combined Trauma and Extremities business to grow mid single digits for the full year.

With that I will now turn the call over to Glenn.

Glenn S. Boehnlein{BIO 19635076 <GO>}
Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. Our organic sales growth was 8.4% in the quarter, the third quarter included the same number of average selling days as Q3 2019 and Q3 2020. Compared to 2019, the 2-year impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 2.2% versus Q3 2020 pricing was 0.7% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales. Our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses saw another very strong quarter continuing the growth momentum of the second quarter with double-digit growth in both segments. Our orthopedics and spine businesses have been adversely impacted by increases in hospitalization rates starting in early August, especially in the US as a result of the Delta variant. The corresponding impact on elective procedures has significantly slowed the recovery in our orthopedics and spine implant businesses. For the quarter, US organic sales increased 7.1% reflecting the continued strong demand for Mako instruments, medical and neurovascular products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 12% impacted by positive sales momentum in Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets.

Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2 in $0.20 increased 15.2% from 2019 reflecting sales growth, gross margin expansion and a lower quarterly effective tax rate, partially offset by the impact of business mix and higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition. Our third quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.04. Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopedics had constant currency sales growth of 19.9% and organic sales growth of 2%, including organic growth of 1% in the US. This reflects the impact of the slowdown in elective procedures. As a result of the Delta variant which primarily impacted our hip and knee implant businesses. Our knee business grew 0.9% organically in the US reflecting the previously mentioned impact on elective procedures offset by continued adoption of our robotic platform for total knee procedures.

Our US Trauma business grew 8.8% reflecting solid performances across the portfolio. Other (inaudible) offset by declines in bone cement. Internationally orthopedics grew 4.1% organically, which reflects the strong performances in Europe and the momentum in Mako internationally, somewhat offset by the increased impact of restrictions imposed on elective procedures due to COVID. For the quarter, our Trauma and Extremities business, which includes Wright Medical delivered 3.2% (inaudible) growth on a comparable basis. In the US comparable growth was 7.4%, which included double-digit growth in our Upper Extremities business. In the quarter MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 12%, which included 12% US organic growth as well. Instruments had US organic sales growth of 15.9% led by double-digit growth in their Orthopedic implants and surgical technology businesses, which include power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and skin closure products. Endoscopy had US organic sales growth of 10.6% reflecting strong performances across their portfolio including video and general surgery products and strong double-digit growth of their Communications and Sports Medicine businesses.

The Medical Division had US organic growth of 12.5% reflecting double-digit performances in its emergency care and Sage businesses. Internationally MedSurg had organic sales growth of 12% reflecting strong growth in the Endoscopy instruments and Medical businesses across Europe and Australia. Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 11.8%. This growth reflects double-digit performances in our Neurovascular, Neurosurgical and Interventional Spine businesses. Our Neurovascular business had particularly strong growth of approximately 26% and makes up roughly 30% of this segment. Our US Neurotech business posted an organic growth of 11.8% reflecting strong product growth in Sonopet iQ, bipolar forceps and bone mill.

Our US Neurovascular business had significant growth in all categories of products including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 24.6%. This performance was driven by strong Neurotech demand in China and other emerging markets, as well as Europe and Australia.

Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the third quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3% was favorable approximately 55 basis points from third quarter 2019. Compared to the third quarter in 2019, gross margin was primarily impacted by acquisitions, which was partially offset by business mix and price. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.7% of sales, reflecting our continued focus on innovation.

Our SG&A was 34.1% of sales, which was slightly negative as compared to the third quarter of 2019. This reflects continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage offset by ramping of certain expenses hiring to support future growth and the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition. In summary for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 25.4% of sales, which is approximately the same as third quarter 2019. This performance primarily resulted from our positive sales momentum, offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions primarily Wright Medical. Related (inaudible) our third quarter had an adjusted effective (inaudible) tax rate of 14% which was impacted by our mix of US and non-US income and favorable (inaudible) discrete items during the quarter. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 14.8%. For the year, we continued to expect in an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 15.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and marketable securities, and total debt of $12.7 billion. Year-to-date, we have paid down $1.2 billion of debt. In October, we completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and increased that facility from $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion.

Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $2.3 billion. This performance reflects the results of earnings and continued focus on working capital management. Based on our performance in the third quarter, the continued volatility experienced as a result of COVID, procedural delays and hospital staffing shortages, as well as uncertainty around the pace of recovery in the fourth quarter, we expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 8%. As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities, to be in the mid-single digits for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019.

If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%, adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by approximately $0.05 to $0.10 in the full year. And this is included in our revised guidance range. Based on our performance in the first three of elective procedures (inaudible), we now expect a adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.08 to $9.50 (inaudible).

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions)

Your first question comes from the line of (inaudible).

Q - Analyst
Thanks for taking the questions, maybe to start on guidance, it sounds like October is off to a slower start, maybe just if you could walk us through the different business lines and how you're seeing them throughout fourth quarter so far and what gives you confidence that you can start to see a pick up, do you have orders increasing or doctors increasing bookings, just help us understand what gives you confidence for the pick up.

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Hey, Robbie, its Preston. So in terms of Q4, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw in October starting to show some improvement as it relates to our implant related businesses and, and so we are seeing a bit of a pickup, but I think it's important to note that it's starting from a lower starting point. So while we do expect there to be some recovery happening in those implant businesses throughout the quarter, we do expect it to get back to more normal levels by the end, there are a few headwinds that are out there as well in terms of not only additional COVID hotspots or things like that, but also with staffing being a potential headwind as well. So we're definitely monitoring those as we go, but we are seeing some improvement early in October versus where we -- where we ended in Q3. As it relates to the other parts of the businesses as both Kevin, Glenn and myself mentioned, our capital business continues to perform very well and we still have high expectations that those are going to continue into Q4. And the way we look at that is just continuing to look at the order book as we ended the quarter and how that continues to progress in terms of growth.

Same thing as we think about those more emerging businesses, whether it's Trauma or Neurovascular, again those businesses are continuing to perform very well and there's no reason to believe that they're going to slow down as we think about Q4, so hopefully that helps.

Q - Analyst
Yeah and. And maybe one more just to dive in a little deeper on the trauma and extremities. You talked about double-digit growth within shoulder, but that was probably the biggest miss of any business versus the street. So I was hoping you could give a little more detail there was lower really slow. It doesn't sound like it's anything from the integration. So just hoping to get more color. Thanks.

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Yeah, I think it's important to understand that on those parts of the business like extremities, like shoulder, like foot and ankle, they are subject to some of the elective procedure slowdown as well. So while they did see some of that impact, we're still really happy with how they performed. I mean they really are still growing, the integration is going well. And as I mentioned, there is -- in terms of the international piece, there's a little bit slower pickup there on some of the international businesses as we go through the transition and integration in those parts of the business.

Q - Analyst
Great, thanks a lot.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic. Matt Miksic, your line is open.

Q - Matt Miksic{BIO 6990080 <GO>}
Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So I had maybe -- first thing, I guess I would say is, at this point, I don't think your comments on COVID-related pressure staffing challenges will come as much of a surprise to many folks who were sort of dragging us into the front and looking into Q4. But I did have a couple of questions on some aspects of the business. One, so it's COVID-related and sort of related to one of your sort of strategic initiatives around ASCs. If you could talk maybe a little bit about the activity that you're seeing there. What kinds of changes you made organization, what kinds of shifts in volumes we've seen and how you think that may affect, so the intermediate term for those businesses, and I have one followup.

A - Kevin Lobo{BIO 22113385 <GO>}
Matt, This is Kevin. And we're continuing to see a shift to the ASC. The challenge we have right now is just the pace of the capacity. It takes time to build and every hospital system is in the process of trying to increase their capacity. So it is improving. And certainly that will be a trend, that it started prior to the pandemic and is continuing. We feel very good about our position in the ASC. Its way ahead of our expectations frankly going into the pandemic. One measure that we look at is our Sports Medicine business and that performed in the United States was north of 20% growth in Q3, so we're seeing strength. But the challenge on the hip and knee side of it is just time to build capacity, so it's growing, but it's going to just take time before it becomes a really, really meaningful part of our business, but we believe we're extremely well positioned both with Mako and even without Mako without portfolio of everything that they need for an ASC.

Q - Matt Miksic{BIO 6990080 <GO>}
That's helpful. And then, my followup is just on maybe trying to look past the pressure that I think many folks are reporting this earnings cycle similar to what you're describing and, and into sort of next year. And I'm not sort of about the trying to prior guidance out of you or anything like that for 2022. But one of the things that we hear often from your businesses and across the board. Is this sort of demand for capital equipment. If we look at challenges and procedures and staffing issues. And then on the other hand hospitals apparently investing fairly heavily in their capital equipment and infrastructure around robotics surgery, et cetera. And I just would love to hear your thoughts on if you see relationship that have seen in the past a relationship to the -- between capital in your procedural businesses and what that sort of tells you about the next 12 to 18 months on the back of this demand. Thanks.

A - Kevin Lobo{BIO 22113385 <GO>}
Well, I think the capital strength is really given the liquidity of hospitals. So hospitals, even though they're struggling through the pandemic there are liquidity is very good. Partially due to the CARES funding that was put in place, they are in a strong position and they are getting ready for the future, as we talked about on the last question about ASCs and construction of ASCs and investments in hospitals, the demand for technology is very strong. Our order book for capital is very strong. And in fact, in Q3, there was actually even some slight delays of some of the capital -- there were some challenges of actually having staff to receive some of the capital equipment and put it in place, but I would say I'm feeling very bullish in that capital cycle should continue speaking in the United States through all of next year.

As it relates to the deferrable procedures hips, knees spine, those represent for Stryker, a little less than 30% of our sales and those are the ones that are most impacted if they will come back and frankly I'm excited about certainly hip and knee where the Mako volume continues to grow. And when those procedures come back, we're in terrific position to capitalize on those because the Mako procedures we're putting in, roughly half of those are going into competitor accounts. And so when volumes come back, we will be able to really take advantage of that, not just in our own Stryker friendly accounts, but even in competitor accounts.

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.

Q - Anthony Petrone{BIO 6789431 <GO>}
Hi, thank you for taking the questions. Couple on just attempting to quantify the backlog specifically in ortho-recon heading into 2022 as we navigate the current delta spike and maybe extending that to capital or you're actually seeing some level of pent-up demand for Mako and maybe just a quick -- sneak a quick one in there, maybe just some high level comments on supply chain pressures that we're hearing across obviously this space and others, is that a potential headwind to the capital business, specifically as we head into 2022. Thank you.

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
So let me see if I can address the different parts in terms of the backlog itself. And so just starting with the implant related backlog, I mean obviously the last 18 months has not been normal from a volume perspective. And so while we've had some good quarters in some slower quarters that backlog has continue to exist. And in some cases, like this quarter it's continued to build. And so it's hard to say exactly what it is because there's just so much variability that's happening across different regions. So if we look at this past quarter, obviously the US was more impacted than other areas. But it's safe to say that the backlog still good some improvement in terms of growth rates over time, it will be sustained.

You won't really see a big, large, outsized growth rate that will happen in any one particular quarter. And with regard to the backlog, as we think about capital, I mean there are areas for sure that there has been some pent-up demand, as some of the uncertainty has just existed out there in terms of some of the hospital systems and but we're still seeing very strong demand for our products, like we talked about before the order book remains really, really strong and it continues to grow, as well as sales. So we feel very bullish, as Kevin said with regards to how we think about capital as we go forward into 2022. With regards to the impact from a raw material or supply chain perspective, what I would tell you is there certainly are challenges just like everybody else has with regards to whether it's a tight labor market or shortages and things like electronics or resins. But as of now, we've been able to really effectively, meet all of our customers' needs and, and so what that really has required is that our supply chain has really had to be much more active and its support and its partnership with the various supplier base that we have and so we've been able to really make sure that we're maintaining our safety stock levels. We're really able to actively purchase critical components were necessary. So that we can keep, there is going to continue to be some headwinds in this area. And so as a result, we have seen some increased costs on those items, but to-date our supply chain procurement teams have really just been able to manage that and so we haven't seen anything really show up in terms of any major impacts on our financials. And so while we expect that to continue and the rest of '21 and into '22 as well. We do want to make sure that whatever we have in our numbers has already been factored in some of those raw material challenges that we have and we're going to just continue to monitor the situation as it progresses.

The next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS.

Q - Young Li{BIO 21683458 <GO>}
Hey, everyone. This is Young LI in for Matt. Thanks so much for taking our questions. I guess I was wondering if you can share a little bit more color on the strength you're seeing in Mako, both in the US and OUS. How do you think it's positioned relative to the -- to the competition, now that there is more entrants in this space. And can you also touch upon the (inaudible) shoulder program, what should we expect in terms of the target that you are looking at and any updates on timelines.

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Procedural slowdowns seeing demand for our system. We clearly have the leading system on the market with a big head start (inaudible) is actually raise the importance of robotics. So we love our position and we believe that it's just going to increase the demand for Mako, more and more systems. So we know we have a winning solution for customers we're very excited. Frankly, with our hip software and our new hip application which is now penetrated in all of our accounts and we're seeing a nice uptick. Even though the overall volumes are down because of COVID, we are seeing a nice uptick in the hip adoption, given the new software, which makes it easier to do the procedure. There is more competitors to space. Just validates the importance of orthopedic and we like our chances.

As it relates to the shoulder program and we do have an active program, we're not in a position right now to talk about timelines or dates for that. But as you saw with our results in Q3. Our shoulder business is doing very well. Even before we have a solution with Mako.

Q - Matt Taylor{BIO 3872000 <GO>}
Okay, great. I appreciate the color there. I guess maybe to followup, just wondering if you can talk about the M&A landscape, how actively are you looking at deals, what do you think about current valuations right now.

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
We are always actively looking at deals and Stryker even after the Wright Medical deal as you saw, we've done a couple of smaller deal with OrthoSensor and Gauss Surgical because of the debt that we had to pay down and we've been focused more on tuck-ins. But I'm really delighted with the cash flow performance that we've had both last year, as well as the first 9 months of this year. So now we can start to look at, let's say, slightly larger tuck-ins while we continue to pay down the debt. Valuations are very high overall, but there is still a lot of targets and we feel pretty confident that we'll be able to continue to run our M&A no offense and find value creating acquisitions for Stryker.

(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler.

Q - Adrian{BIO 18944390 <GO>}
Hi guys, this is Adrian for Matt. Thank you for taking the question. I just was wondering if you could talk about Mako in China, Japan. Asia has been a bright spot in some areas and a mixed bag and others for handful of companies that have reported so far. So just wondering how you would characterize that rollout. Each of those geographies.

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Yeah. So I would just say that in terms of Mako as we think about outside the United States. We're really pleased with how that's progressing and we're seeing good growth really in all markets outside the US as we think about Japan, for example, we know that the business continues to progress well. And the number of installs in Japan is increasing month over month. So we're really happy with how the technology has been received. And the feedback that we're getting, and the number of procedures that are being done on Mako in Japan to increase, as well as far as China's concerned it's much earlier days in China from a macro standpoint. But the momentum is really building there. We're still working through the impact of the volume based procurement activity, but we do expect may go to be a key technology in a key role for us -- play a key role for us as we think about our business in China.

Q - Adrian{BIO 18944390 <GO>}
Okay, thanks for that. And then just a quick follow-up here on the neurovascular side, the performance has been and really, really strong the last couple of quarters. So maybe you can give us a sense for what you think the market growth rate looks like there and then just sensor what's driving your portfolio of products to really take share compared to quarters in the past. Thank you.

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Yeah, so in terms of their vascular. Obviously, it's a very hot market and, but also when you look at our results. With regards to that market you're seeing a couple of things happen you're seeing really the impact of the technologies that we've been able to introduce over the past 12 to 18 months and taking advantage of really a product super cycle really from our neurovascular team where we're expanding into some different areas and then also we're seeing the market expansion, if you think about places like China, for example, we're seeing market expansion happened there.

Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.

Q - Vijay{BIO 14025493 <GO>}
Maybe one on the big picture and one on the finance side. Starting with the big picture, Kevin. It seems like there is appeal 2 cities in the wasteland some of your peers have the assume Q4 sort of normalizing on the procedure side. Other companies, certainly have called out in Q4 being in line with 3Q levels and things worsening or perhaps being similar to September trends is this more regional, you know, this is a impact or is this an auto versus other parts of device. Maybe just to put things in the perspective on why we're seeing divergence and what are you assuming for the Q4 recovery.

A - Kevin Lobo{BIO 22113385 <GO>}
As Preston mentioned the Q4 we're assuming a similar growth rate as we saw in Q3 so versus 2019. We're expecting similar kind of growth rate obviously sequentially will have improvement because Q4 is a larger quarter than Q3, but year-over-year, we're expecting a similar growth rate. Related to that question, I would say that it's really ortho and spine related. We have products that are used in general surgery in our endoscopy division and smoke evacuation and we're not seeing the same kind of fall off in those areas as we're seeing in hips, knees spine. So I do believe it's mostly procedure related, which creates the difference that you're describing between us and some of the other med-tech companies. There is also regional and Stryker of course has a very strong presence in the United States. And so that regional impact you even saw that with our own implant businesses that we had a more negative impact in the United States than we did in international and so that's the secondary factor, but I would say the primary factor for what you're seeing versus other companies is that these procedures hips, knees, spine are more deferrable than some of the other procedures and some of our other med-tech peers

Q - Vijay{BIO 14025493 <GO>}
That's helpful perspective and one on finance, Glenn. Free cash flow year-to-date, we're running pretty close to 90%, has something changed (inaudible), I know people used to ask and free cash flow with this review and execution here despite some choppiness on the pandemic side, the margin execution free cash makes (inaudible) seems be stellar some key.

A - Glenn S. Boehnlein{BIO 19635076 <GO>}
Vijay. You're right. Free cash flow of almost 2.1 billion year-to-date and 87% conversion ratio. A lot of it, a lot of it has to do with several factors we've been sort of priming the organization to really start focusing and delivering on cash flow. I think as we entered into COVID, it was a real alarm bell for hey, let's really start focusing on this, so that we can sort of keep active in M&A, we can pay down debt, we can meet a lot of the sort of goals that we wanted to meet. So I think we're feeling a little bit of that you look at performance on AR, we've started to move a lot of our AR into shared service centers and so we're getting better on process, if you look at AP, we have a large initiative that's being driven by our GQO organization in terms of working with vendors and being smart about what our AP terms can be and should be and then all of our divisions are very focused on inventory management and just being smarter about what, what are the safety stock levels that you really need and what don't you need and how can we make sure that we're having the right inventory at the right time when we need it and then I think the other thing that we're feeling a little bit is, we have been fairly controlled and prudent as we look at allocating dollars to capital expenditures and if you look at our Wright Medical integration we've really been focused on that spend as well and are running, probably a little ahead of where our goals were on that, so I really do think that it's a muscle that the organization is really learned and has grown over the past 2 years and it's something that I feel pretty strongly about we'll be able to continue from here on out.

Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.

Q - Josh Jennings{BIO 16451037 <GO>}
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. It's a question on staffing shortages, maybe a little bit (inaudible), but just thinking about the different settings of care and staff shortages and in hospitals. I think it's clear, but about ASCs, is there a different dynamic in play of ASCs. And if staffing shortage headwind persist in the 2022, do you think we could see even stronger migration trends of surgeries into the ASCs as predicted out more so in the hospital setting. Because of obviously there's a lot more fatigue, that's been there. There's COVID, it is still exist in the hospital setting. So I think that it certainly is playing out a bit more in the hospital setting. To be having -- we still see in our procedural volumes in the ASC continue to go and certainly have not been as impacted as those in the hospital, how that continues and how that can impact the shift, I think is still it really anybody's guess. And we certainly will continue to expect to see products and procedures shifting to the ASC anyway because that trend, it's already started and certainly accelerated over the last 18 months. So I think that's going to continue to happen. The staffing shortage is something I think we're going to live with for a little bit as well. And so we'll continue to work through those challenges in the next year also.

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Thanks. It's Preston. I want to just follow up on revenue. I know you reiterated multiple times in this call just that integration is progressing nicely and you're optimistic about the combined businesses in Trauma and Extremities, but you've had to work through some dis-synergies associated integration pandemic headwinds, the November (inaudible) is coming up, but as we get into a normalized rate should we be thinking about the Trauma and Extremities business is accretive to corporate-wide organic revenue growth, as that integration first year is completed, hopefully we'll get into normalized grades in 2022. Thanks a lot.

A - Kevin Lobo{BIO 22113385 <GO>}
This is Kevin. I would say that I'm absolutely bullish about the Wright Medical integration. It's been fantastic in the United States as Preston mentioned, we still have work to do. I would say the United States, the timing is a little bit later with some of the conversions of our distributors. And so we're still working through OUS. But in the US very bullish about Trauma, Upper Extremities and Lower. Lower of course, has been impacted somewhat by the deferral of procedures. Because there are more elective, a lot of the foot and ankle procedures, but love the leadership team that we have in place. love the pipeline that we have in place. And really believe that the entire business of Trauma and Extremities will be accretive so overall Stryker.

As you know Extremities is probably the fastest growing space within orthopedics and we have a fantastic -- integration has been for us to also have a dedicated business just on Trauma. So three dedicated businesses three terrific leaders of all teams and so we're seeing that, frankly, as you saw with the US number on a combined basis being over 8% is really terrific performance in spite of a slowdown in the foot and ankle space, the overall businesses and I do expect in '22 and beyond that, it will be accretive to Stryker's overall growth rate.

Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.

Q - Larry Biegelsen{BIO 7539249 <GO>}
Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Two for me, one you have an Analyst Meeting coming up in a few weeks. Could you guys give us a preview of what to expect. Are you going to give us long term financial goals and I had one followup.

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Hey, Larry. It's Preston. Yes, we're we're really going to really talk about all the growth drivers that make Stryker special as we think about emerging from the pandemic and all the different things that are going to help our business continue to grow into the future for sure, the long-term financial goals will definitely be part of that.

Q - Larry Biegelsen{BIO 7539249 <GO>}
Kevin or Glenn, how are you feeling about continuing to deliver top tier revenue growth and the 30 to 50 basis points of leverage that you guys target. How are you feeling about that with the inflation headwind that we're all paying close attention to. Thanks for taking the questions.

A - Kevin Lobo{BIO 22113385 <GO>}
Sure. On the first question, as you've seen over the last 9 years and fully expect into the future. That we will have organic sales growth at the high end of med-tech. Clearly COVID has put a (inaudible) that in in hips, knees and spine. But other than that you're seeing that in all of the rest of our businesses and as the recovery happens you should fully expect that will continue to be a top tier grower. As it relates to margins. Glenn, do you want to.

A - Glenn S. Boehnlein{BIO 19635076 <GO>}
Yeah. If I look at op margin, first of all, even just look at this quarter and given the impact of COVID, given the dilution from Wright Medical, I mean we're pretty happy that our op margin is pretty much flat with 2019. So that's a good performance. We did not contemplate the impacts we're feeling from COVID in op margin guidance, and so we'll talk about more at the Analyst Meeting sort of what we think that means, but what I will tell you is we have every intention to drive that goal, once we exit the impacts of COVID, so the organization will not back away from that and we'll even during COVID we're very mindful of our discipline around spending and how important that is.

So we'll expect to see some increases in spending in Q4 and those will set us up to grow in 2022. So we, we really will allow sort of spending around some of those sales force hiring and marketing initiatives to occur. But as far as it relates to 30 to 50 basis points, beyond what we feel in COVID, we will not back away from that goal.

The next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer.

Q - David{BIO 1736963 <GO>}
This is David on for Steve. Thanks for taking our questions on I just wondering if you could maybe talk about what you're seeing currently in terms of the China tenders and volume based procurement

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
When we think about the products and services that are -- that are impacted by the volume based tendering, if we think about JR Trauma and Spine, those sales really are -- that are exposed to the tendering process and less than 1% of the total Stryker revenue. So it's a very small Overall impact as we think about for Stryker. But I guess just focusing on the tender itself in mid-September as everybody knows the bidding was done for the national for our business. Overall, as everybody also knows about 80% price reduction from the end market sale is going to be taking place across the entire industry. And so certainly that has an impact on us as we think about going going forward, but there's a lot of work still left to be done in terms of how that's going to actually be executed. So we're staying vigilant with the teams in China to try to understand how that's going to roll out -- expected to roll out. I think in the first quarter of next year and so it will remain dynamic and so we really understand how it's going to execute. In terms of '22, we're not giving guidance at this point in time and it will certainly be factored in as we give guidance in our fourth quarter earnings call.

Q - David{BIO 1736963 <GO>}
Okay, great. I appreciate the color. Just one followup, what are your latest thoughts on smart implants and what's your outlook for this market now having OrthoSensor under your umbrella for several quarters. Thanks.

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
Yeah, so with smart implants. I mean, like we said in the past, we think that there is a role that smart implants are going to play with regards to Orthopedics going forward. But there's still a lot of work to be done in terms of understanding how that's going to be integrated from an implant and then understanding how that's going to play out from a monitoring standpoint going forward. So I would say it's still early in the process. We're happy to have OrthoSensor under the Stryker name and certainly the expertise that they bring in the sensor technology and so looking forward to updating you as we develop more around that for the product in the future.

Q - David{BIO 1736963 <GO>}

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.

Q - Ryan Zimmerman{BIO 20228112 <GO>}
Thanks for taking the question. So I just want to ask specifically based on the organic growth guidance of 7% to 8% for 2019 and kind of where consensus is landing, obviously there is a Delta there and you've already. It's clear, obviously around the elective areas in terms of the impact in the fourth quarter and kind of what you're guiding to. I guess, I'm just curious, Kevin or Preston and was there anything the call, particularly within the MedSurg areas from a headwind standpoint that you caution us about just because the Delta versus the Street somewhat meaningful as we think about our models and so I just want to make sure that we're not skipping over any impact that it could be have us contemplated within that.

A - Kevin Lobo{BIO 22113385 <GO>}
Just to reiterate what I said in my opening comments, we expect very high performance for MedSurg and Neurotechnology so we expect them to perform very similarly, it may not be -- there are some puts and takes between the businesses a little bit, but overall, you should expect similar growth out of MedSurg and Neurotechnology in Q4 as you saw in Q3. So the Delta versus the Street is clearly in the hip, knee and spine area that's the area that's had the biggest impact from COVID and what we're calling in our guidance as for a similar quarter in Q4 as Q3. Now obviously, we don't have a lot of visibility. It's an uncertain environment. Hopefully the recovery will be better than what we're calling, but that's the visibility that we have thus far, and as you saw this quarter surprised us Q3 and we're being cautious as we give our guidance for Q4.

Q - Ryan Zimmerman{BIO 20228112 <GO>}
So fair. I appreciate that Kevin. And then just a followup, you have a new hip stem coming out, you've got the software now, I think on the entire fleet of Makos and so I'd love to understand, just kind of your expectation of what for your particularly within direct anteriors that J&J has been so dominant in for some time.

A - Preston Wells{BIO 21578573 <GO>}
We're really excited about the new stem the procedures are being launched this quarter early launch I'd call it this quarter and we're building up towards a full launch of the hip stem at the AAOS meeting, which is towards the end of the first quarter. So it will be a bit of a slow build, but we're really excited and that's stem, we will marry that step up with Mako. So that's one of the things we still have to do that but I would say, you'll start to see pretty meaningful impact in probably by the end of the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter, you'll start to see meaningful impact, but this is a product gap that we've had for some time. Very excited about, about the position that we're in, we're building the product right now, surgeons who have seen in the product are very excited about it. So we do believe it's what we've needed frankly within our Hip portfolio and you'll start to see that again, you won't see a lot, you won't see anything really in the fourth quarter and you won't see much in the first quarter, but it will start to have an impact in the second quarter and definitely in the back half of next year.
