They look like, you know, it it really just think of like just macro tonnage.

So, you know, we we we I guess, what I would say is, specifically on the cathode side, like, flexibility is the is the way we're going to achieve this, and not all of the materials that go into cathodes are actually, first of all, to secure, like, through mining or refining.",
