    "text": "Thank you. So to recap, [ph]as some listening is extra someone or anyone in the industry have seen year-over-year declines in order volumes in Q3, Tesla at the same time has achieved record deliveries. In fact, I think if you look at EV companies worldwide, to the best of my knowledge, no EV companies even profitable and I'm not -- to the best of my knowledge, there is no EV division of any company -- of any existing order company that is profitable. So it is notable that Tesla is profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment and this quarter actually is a record Q3 for us. So we produced our 7-millionth vehicle actually just yesterday, so congratulations to the teams that made it happen to Tesla. That's a staggeringly immense amount of work to make 7 million cars. So let's see. And we also have -- the energy storage business is growing like wildfire with strong demand for both Megapack and Powerwall. And as people know, on October 10th, we laid out a vision for an autonomous and liquid future that I think is very compelling to us. The Tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an opportunity to experience the future where you have humanoid robots walking among the crowd, not with the cam video presentation or anything but officially walking among the crowd, serving drinks and whatnot. And we had 50 autonomous vehicles. There were 20 Cybercabs, but there were an additional 30 Model Y's operating fully autonomously the entire night carrying thousands, -- thousands of people -- thousands of people's drink with no incidents the entire night. So -- and for those who went there that it's worth emphasizing that the Cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerated pedals. Meaning there was no -- there's no possible -- there was no way for anyone to intervene manually even if they wanted to and the whole night went very smoothly. So regarding the vehicle business, we are still on track to deliver more affordable models starting in the first half of 2025. You know, this is -- I think probably people are wondering what should they assume for vehicle -- vehicle sales growth next year. And at the risk of -- to take a bit of risk here, I do want to give some rough estimate, which is I think it's 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year. You know, notwithstanding negative external events, like if there's some portion mature events like some big war breaks out or interest rates go sky high or something like that, then we can't overcome massive force mature events. But I think with our lower-cost vehicles with the advent of autonomy, something like 20% to 30% growth next year is my best case. And then Cybercab reaching volume production in '26. We do feel confident of Cybercab reaching volume production in '26, not just starting production, but reaching volume production in '26 and that -- that should be substantial growth. We're aiming for at least 2 million units a year of Cybercab and that'll be in more than one factory but I think it's at least 2 million units here maybe $4 million ultimately. So, yeah, these are just my best guesses but if you ask for my best guesses, those are my best guesses. The 46 -- the cell 4680 lines, the team is actually doing great work there. The 4680 is rapidly approaching the point where it is the most competitive cell. So when you consider the fully -- the fully landed -- the cost of a battery pack fully landed in the US net of incentives and duties about the 4680 is tracking to be the most competitive, maybe lower cost [ph]because what are fully considered than any other alternative, which is -- and I'm not quite there yet, but we're -- we're close to being there, which I think is extremely exciting. And we've got several -- a lot of ideas to go well beyond that. So if I think there's -- if we execute well, the 4680, we'll have the Tesla internally produced cell will be the most cost-competitive cell in something [ph] in North America. A testament to a tremendous amount of hard work there by the team. So that's the rule. We'll continue to buy a lot of sales from our competitors. Our intent is not to make -- to provide -- to make sales just internally. So I don't want to set off any involved males [ph] here. We're obviously increasing substantially our vehicle output and our stationary storage output. So we need a lot of sales. And most of them will still come from suppliers, but I think it is -- it is some good news that the Tesla internal cell is likely -- is tracking to be the most competitive in the U.S.. So with respect to autonomy, as people are experiencing in the cars really from week-to-week, there are significant improvements in the miles between interventions. So with the new version 12.5 release of -- also driving Cybertruck, the -- combining the code into a single stack so that the city driving and the engine and highway driving are on one stack, which is a big improvement for the highway driving so it's just all neural nets and the release of actually Smart Summon. We try to have a sense of humor here at Tesla. And we're also -- so that's 12.5. Version13 of FSD is going out soon. Shortly, we'll elaborate more on that later in the call. We expect to see roughly a 506-volt improvement in miles between interventions compared to 12.5. And actually -- looking at the year as a whole, the improvement in miles between interventions, we think will bring at least three orders of magnitude. So that's a very dramatic improvement in the course of the year. And we expect that trend to continue next year. So the current -- the current internal expectation -- internal expectation for the Tesla FSD having longer miles between convention than human is the second quarter of next year, which means it may end up being the third quarter, but it's next -- it seems extremely likely to be next year. Ashok, do you want to -- maybe you want to?",

And mentioning miles between critical interventions, yeah, like you mentioned Elon, we already made a 100 times improvement with 12.5 from starting of this year and then V13 release, we expect to be 100 times from the beginning from January of this year on my production release software. And this came in because of technology improvements going to end-to-end, having higher frame rate, partly also helped by hardware force, more capabilities, and so on. And we hope that we continue to scale the neural network, the data, the training compute, et cetera. By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average human minds for critical intervention probably collision in that case.",

So the vast majority of humanity has no idea what Tesla provide themselves. So especially for something like a Model 3 or Model Y, it looks like a normal car. So you don't expect normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself. The Cybercab looks different but Model Y and Model 3 are -- look -- they're good-looking cars but they look fairly normal. You don't expect a barely normal looking car to have the intelligence, enough AI to be able to drive itself, but it does. So we do want to expose that to more people and so we're doing -- every time we have a significant improvement in the software, we'll roll out another sort of 30-day trial, so to encourage people to try it again. And we are seeing a significant improvement in adoption. So the take rate for FSD has improved substantially, especially after the 10-10 event. Yeah. So there's no need to wait for Robotaxi or Cybercab for to experience full autonomy. We expect to achieve that next year with our existing vehicle end.",

    "text": "Yeah and we actually -- we have -- for Tesla employees in the Bay Area, we already are offering a ride hailing capability. So you can actually -- with the development app, you can request a ride and it will take you anywhere in the Bay Area. We do have a safety driver for now, but the software required to do that we've developed. I mean, David, do you want to elaborate on that? Unidentified Speaker Yeah, sure. It's David. We shared some screenshots of this in the Q1 shareholder deck. And this is real. We've been testing it for the latter part of the year and the building blocks that we needed in order to build this functionality and deliver it to production. We've been thinking about it and working on for years. It just so happens that we've used those building blocks to deliver great features for our customers in the meantime, such as sharing your profile, synchronizing it across cars so that every single car that you jump into, whether it's another car that you own or a car that somebody has loan to you or a rental car that you jump into, it looks exactly like yours. Everything synchronized, seat mirror positions, media, navigation, everything is the same, just what you would expect from one of our Robotaxis. But we gave that functionality to our customers right now because we built it intending for it to be used in the future. So we're releasing that functionality now. All the end-to-end cybersecurity that we knew we're going to need to deliver that functionality, sending a navigation destination from your phone to the vehicle. And so, you're doing that now with the ride hailing app, but it's something that we've made available to customers for years. Seen the progress on a route in the mobile app. That's something you'll need for the ride hailing app, but again, we released it in the meantime. So it's not like we're just starting to think about this stuff right now while we're building out the early stages of our ride hailing network. We've been thinking about this for quite a long time and we're excited to get the functionality out there.",

    "text": "Yeah. And we do expect to roll out the ride hailing in California and Texas next year to the public. But not the California has somewhat quite a long regulatory approval process. It shouldn't -- I think we should get approval next year, but it's continued upon regulatory approval. Texas is a lot faster so it's kind of -- I'd say, we'll definitely have it available in Texas and probably have it available in California subject to regulatory approval. And maybe some other states actually next year as well but at least in California and Texas. So I think that would be very exciting. There's really a profound change. Tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle and battery manufacturing company at that point. So we published the Q3 vehicle safety report which shows one crash for every 7 million miles of Autopilot. That compares to the U.S. average of water crash roughly every 700,000 miles. So it's currently showing a 10 times safety improvement relative to the U.S. average. And we continue to expand our AI training capacity to accommodate the needs of both FSD and Optimus. We are currently not a training compute-constrained. So that's the point big limiting factors that the FSD is actually getting so good that it takes us a while to actually find mistakes, and when you start getting to where it can take 10,000 miles to find a mistake, it takes a while to actually figure out which it is. Is this software built better -- is software built A better than software built B? It actually takes a while to figure it out because neither one of them making mistakes or take a long time to make mistakes. So that's actually the single limiting -- big limiting factor is how long does it take us to figure out which version is better? Sort of high-class problem. Obviously having a drag fleet is very helpful for breaking this out. And then with Optimus, we showed a massive improvement in Optimus' dexterity movement on October 10 and our next-gen handed form which is 22 degrees freedom, which doubles the prior handed form. It's extremely human-like and also has much better tactile sensing. It's really I feel confident in saying that we have most advanced humanoid robot by longshot. And we're moreover the only company that really has all of the ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robots. Because the things that what other companies are missing is that they're missing the AI brain that they're missing the ability to really scale to very-high volume production. So you sort of see some impressive video demos, but they're likely the localized AI and the ability to scale volume to very high numbers. As I've said on a few occasions before, I think Optimus will ultimately be the most valuable part and I think it has a good chance of being the most valuable product ever made. For the energy business, that's doing extremely well. And the opportunity ahead is gigantic. The Megapack factory reached 200 Megapacks a week, which is now a 40-gigawatt hour a year run-rate. And we have a second factory in Shanghai that will begin with a 20-gigawatt hour year run-rate in Q1 next year, next quarter. And that will also scale up. It won't be long before we're shipping 100-gigawatt hours a year stationary storage at Tesla. And we'll -- that will ultimately grow I think to multiple terawatt hours per year. It has to actually in order to have a sustainable energy future if you're at the terawatt scale here you're not really moving the needle. So if you look at our mentally very complicated last master plan, which I think actually has too much detail. I'll maybe I'll ask Gran [ph] to analyze it. Unidentified Speaker And shorten it up.",

    "text": "Yeah. Give us the TLDR on the last management plan. But we showed in that master plan that it is possible to take all of us to a fully sustainable energy situation using sustainable energy power generation and batteries and electric transport. And there are no fundamental material limitations like there's not some very rare material that we don't have enough of on earth. We actually have enough of the raw materials to take all of human civilization, make it fully sustainable, and even if civilization dramatically increased its electricity usage, it would still be fully sustainable. One way to think of the progress of a civilization, which may sound a little esoteric, but is percentage completion of cautious of scale. So cautious scale one would be you're using all the power of a planet. We were -- we're currently less than 1% on cloud shift level, level one. Level two would be using all the power of the Sun and level three all of the power of the galaxy. So we have a long way to go. Long way to go. When you think of quartership terms, it becomes obvious that by far the biggest source of energy is the sun. Everything else is in the noise. So in conclusion, Tesla is focused on building the future of energy, transport, robotics and AI and this is a time when others are just focused on managing around near-term trends. We think what we're doing is the right approach and if we execute on our objectives, I think we will. Tesla -- my prediction is Tesla will become the most valuable company in the world and probably by long shot. I want to thank the Tesla team once again for strong execution in a tough operating environment, and we're looking forward to building an incredibly exciting future. Thank you. Travis Axelrod Great.

    "text": "Yeah. Thanks. Our Q3 results were all positive. And once again demonstrate the scale to which business has evolved over the years with the generation of record operating cash flows of $6.3 billion. Our automotive revenues grew both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. While we had unit volume growth, we did experience reduction in ASPs, primarily due to the impact of financing incentives. As a reminder, we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks and financial institutions and recognize the cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to revenue. We released FSD for Cybertruck and other features like actually Smart Summon like Elon talked about in North America, which contributed $326 million of revenues in the quarter. We continue to see elevated levels of regulatory credit sales with over $2 billion of revenues so far this year. To expand on this, at an industry level, China continues to outperform U.S. and Europe by a factor of three. And if there is something to be learned from that, this gives a signal of what is to come in other regions as customers acceptance of EV goes and we feel that is the right strategy to build affordabl and more compelling needs. Our focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a buildup of inventory. To support this strategy, we are continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options in every market. When you compare any vehicle in our lineup with other OEMs, we believe our vehicles provide much better value, particularly when you consider the safety features, performance and unparalleled software functionalities like David also talked about, include also what Ashok had talked about autonomy, music options, parental controls and much more. While every vehicle in our lineup comes up with these capabilities, there is an awareness gap not just with buyers, but at times even with existing owners. We plan on making these more visible in our interactions with both existing and future customers. Automotive margins improved quarter-over-quarter as a result of 50 features release discussed before. Increase in our overall production and delivery volume, continued benefit from marketing pricing and more localized deliveries in region, which resulted in lower freight annuities. Sustaining these margins in Q4, however, will be challenging given the current economic environment. So that we are focused on the cost per vehicle and there are numerous work streams within the company to squeeze our cost without compromising customer experience.",

    "text": "Yeah. I mean that is one trend which we observed in the industry that because of the affordability being impacted because of interest rates, people are holding on to the cars longer, especially in the U.S.. And that is actually having an impact on the overall industry too. As we've discussed earlier -- as we've discussed in prior quarters, energy deployments fluctuate quarter-over-quarter due to customer readiness, location of orders being fulfilled and not necessarily an indicator of demand or production within the quarter. While we did see a decline in Q3, we expect to grow deployment sequentially in Q4 to end the year more than double of last year. Energy margins in Q3 bore a record at more than 30%. This is a function of mix of projects being deployed in the quarter. Note that there will be fluctuation in margins as we manage through deployments and our inventory. Our pipeline and backlog continued to grow quarter-over-quarter as we fill our 2025 production slots and we are doing our level best to keep up with the demand. Just coming back on automotive margins, I talked about -- sorry, I talked about what is happening. One other thing which I want to also share is that question, that, you know, we will continue to keep whatever we can to squeeze, like I said before, about squeezing out the cost. But this is something which we also are very capable of. I mean, just in Q3, we reached our lowest cost per vehicle and that is a trend which we want to keep focus on. Then going on to service and other, we continue to show improvements in Q3. This was a result of better performance both in our service business, which includes collision part sales and merchandise and continued growth in supercharging. These fleet-based revenues will continue to grow as the overall fleet size increases. Our operating expenses declined quarter-over-quarter and a year-on-year basis. This is partially due to the restructuring we undertook in Q2. Cost savings from these initiatives were partially offset by increase in costs related to our AI efforts. We've started using the GPU cluster-based out of our factory in Austin ahead of schedule and are on track to get 50k GPUs deployed in Texas by the end of this month. One thing which I'd like to elaborate is that we're being very judicious on our AI compute spend too and saying how best we can utilize the existing infrastructure before making further investments. On the CapEx front, we had over $3.5 billion in the quarter. This was a sequential increase largely because of investments in AI Compute. We now expect our CapEx for the year to be in excess of $11 billion. We shared our vision for the future at the V-Robot event at the beginning of the month. The Tesla team is hyperfocused on delivering on that vision. Now all efforts are underway to make it a reality. While we've achieved significant progress this year, it will take time to get this as we pioneer new and incredibly complex technologies and navigate a fragmented regulatory landscape. Future is incredibly bright and I want to thank the Tesla team once again for all the help. Questions And Answers A - Travis Axelrod Great. Thank you very much, Vaibhav.

It's not that there are no horses. Yeah, there are some horses, but they're unusual. They're niche and so everything's going to be electric autonomous. I think this is frankly blindingly obvious at this point that that is the future. So, a lot of automotive companies, most automotive companies have not internalized this, which is surprising because we've been shouting this from the rooftops for such a long time and it will accrue to their detriments in the future. But all of our vehicles in the future will be -- all the vehicles that we've really made, all the 7 million vehicles, the vast majority are capable of autonomy and we're currently making on the order of 35,000 autonomous vehicles a week.

So you gave interesting statistics on how much you have and you said you don't feel your compute is constrained. And I was wondering how you are putting to work this additional compute. Is that a game for you of creating larger and larger models, like next generation of models that are larger the way OpenAI goes from GPT-three to GPT-four? Or is that more like you're set on your model and you need to throw more and more compute to accelerate the pace of learning to improve reliability? And then I had a quick follow-up, really quick, on your rollout in Texas and in California next year. The plan, as you see today, is it to roll out a fleet or two cars that will start with a supervisory, like some onboard supervision, someone sitting at the wheel just in case and removing the supervisors progressively, or are you aiming for going full fledged without even a human supervisor when you get started?",

  {
    "speaker": "Elon Musk",
    "text": "Okay. Well, I guess regarding answer, yeah, the the the first part of the question. The the the nature of real world AI is different from, say, LLM in that you you have a massive amount of context. So that, like, the the you've you've got a case of Tesla seven or eight cameras that, you know, nine up to nine if you include the internal camera that that that so so you you you got gigabytes of context, and and that that is then distilled down into a small number of control outputs. You know, whereas it's it's like, you don't really it's very rare to have, in fact, I'm not sure any LM out there, like, two gigabytes of context. And then you've gotta you've gotta then process that in the car with a a very small amount of compute power. So, you know, it's it's it's all doable, and it's happening, but it is a different problem than than what, say, a Gemini or an OpenAI is doing. And now part of the way you can make up for the fact that the inference computer is is quite small is by spending a lot of effort on training. And just like just like a human, like, the more you train on something, the less the less mental workload it takes when you try when when you when you do it. Like, when the the first time, like, a human starts driving, it absorbs your your whole mind. But then as you train more and more on driving, you get very good, then you the driving cover becomes a background task. It doesn't it only absorbs a small amount of your mental capacity because you have a lot of training. So we can make up for the fact that the inference computer is it's it's it's tiny compared to, you know, a a a ten kilowatt bank of GPUs because you got you've got a few hundred watts of of inference compute. We can make up that with heavy training. So yeah. That's and and and then there's also vast amounts that the the actual, you know, petabytes of data coming in are tremendous. And then sorting out what training is important was, you know, of the vast amounts of video training or video data coming in complete, what is actually most important for training. That's also quite difficult. But as I said, we're we're we're not currently training compute constraint. I'm Ashok, do you wanna elaborate?",

We do have simulation and other ways to get those metrics. Those two help. But in the end, that's a big bottleneck. Yeah. That's why you're not training computer constraint alone.

Like like, answering questions, answering questions on a on a ten kilowatt rack. It's like, can't put that in the car. It's a different problem. Please do. No. Exactly. So, you know, xAI is because I felt there wasn't there wasn't a truth seeking digital superintelligence company out there. Like, that's what it came down to. That they needed to be a truth seeker, like like, an an AI company that is very rigorous about being truthful. And so I'm not saying XAI is perfect, but that is but that that that is at least the explicit aspiration. Even if something is, you know, politically incorrect, it should still be truthful. I think this is very important for AI safety. So, anyway, I think AIX and AI will that has been helpful to Tesla and will continue to be helpful to Tesla, but they are very different problems.",

    "text": "Great. You know? And and, like, if you and also thinking, like like, what is like, what what other car company has has a world class chip design team? Like, What other car company has a world class AI team like Tesla does? Zero. Those are all start ups. They're created from scratch. Great. Thank you, Milan. And I think that's unfortunately all the time that we have for today. We appreciate all of your questions, and we look forward to hearing you next quarter. Thank you very much, and goodbye.",
