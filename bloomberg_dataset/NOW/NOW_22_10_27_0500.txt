Bill McDermott{BIO 3075298 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Darren and, I'll add my welcome to everyone joining today's call. ServiceNow had an outstanding third quarter. Looking at the top-line results in constant-currency, subscription revenue was 28.5% growth. cRPO, growth was 25%. On profitability, operating margin was 26%. All three metrics are above our guidance meeting expectations once again.

ServiceNow had 69 Q3 deals greater than $1 million. Our US federal business had its best quarter ever in Q3. We saw strength across industries and business segments. Our performance was consistent globally with Europe executing especially well this quarter. Our renewal rate remains best-in-class at 98%. We are the largest organically grown enterprise software company. We have an unmatched combination of organic growth and profitability at scale.

As these Q3 results demonstrate, we fully intend to maintain this leadership position. Regarding operating environment, in recent quarters we said that secular tailwinds was stronger than macro crosswinds, they are. Nothing we saw in Q3 changes this core [ph] thesis. Digital technology is a deflationary force the enterprise digital transformation market is validated. The investment thesis is stronger than ever, hybrid multi-cloud deployments adoption of a modern data infrastructure stack cybersecurity and risk management, AI and, data analytics, remote work and collaboration. These trends are not only durable, their relevance is expanding. There'll be $750 million new applications built by 2025.

In the US alone, nearly $100 million workers will remain in hybrid environments. $27 billion connected devices will drive more data into the cloud over the next three years. And ServiceNow's platform directly addresses all these challenges, which translates to numerous growth vectors for our business. Again one thing from CEOs consistently. Anything we prioritize must generate results in weeks or months. This is the essence of the great reprioritization. And past decades waves of enterprise systems were introduced to meet market challenges of those times operating systems, databases, applications, what we seeing now is a generational shift from architectures built in the last century to platforms, engineer for this one.

If you look at the ERP market, we see customers at various stages of their move to the Cloud. Some of the world's largest manufacturers for example are consolidating hundreds of all procurement processes into a modern workflow experience. This declutters the legacy environment, driving more than $1 billion in cost efficiencies, which is one of our many ERP wins this quarter.

We can do it because ServiceNow was born in the cloud. We integrated with everyone. We meet our customers wherever they are, any environment, any organizational structure, any operating model, where there is complexity, we simplify, we are fast to deploy, fast to generate ROI. In this need for speed environment, the ServiceNow platform is becoming the strategic center of gravity for our customers in light of this today, we're announcing a new initiative (inaudible) with ServiceNow to scale 1 million ServiceNow certified professionals by 2024.

Our customers, partners and ServiceNow itself are all growing their ServiceNow workforces.. We see opportunity everywhere. We'll up with ServiceNow, we'll give people the knowledge to seize it. Overall, the demand environment is strong the market opportunity is growing the ecosystem is expanding.

ServiceNow is a growth company on every level. We see the growth across multiple buyer personas as customers consume more of our expanding solution portfolio in Q3, both ITSM and ITOM were in 17 of our top-20 deals. With six deals each over $1 million. Security and risk we're in 15 of the top 20 with, five deals over $1 million.

Customer and employee workflows were each in 12 of the top-20. Once again we saw creator work with all the top 20 deals with nine deals over $1 million. Customers view ServiceNow as mission-critical. The Defense Logistics Agency works with ServiceNow to support the global defense supply chain with automated workflows.

Faced with the crisis of Hurricane Ian the State of Florida, ServiceNow you deploy a mission-critical application to manage requests from people searching for their loved ones. And crisis two situations weeks to deploy isn't an option, which is why the did it on ServiceNow in a few hours.

Dutch telecom provided KPN works with ServiceNow. We reduced their order management process from three days to under a minute saving millions,. Thank you these stories are everywhere, in fact one CEO who chose ServiceNow for the first time said it best to me personally, it's always easier to make a strategic partner decision when you trust the people on the, other side of it.

In late September, we announced the ServiceNow Tokyo release. We delivered AI-powered task intelligence. Which is all about making the customer service agents' life more productive, reducing manual effort, speeding time to resolution and improving the customer experience. On the revenue facing-side, we delivered enhancements to order management, including support for bundling configurable products and pricing models.

We delivered major advances in-field service operations and dispatch with scheduled optimization and territory planning. These capabilities help our customers better manage their cost, but also their ESG footprint. At the moment when customer service is isn't the very top of C-Level agenda ServiceNow net-new innovation is driving and transforming the front-office. For technology leaders, we released a new service operations workspace, which will deliver faster incident resolutions to keep people highly productive. And given the ongoing migration to the cloud, we released new license Cloud Cost Simulator, so leaders can model the cost benefits moving on-premise to cloud deployments.

And Tokyo [ph] release contains many more new features across each of our major workflow businesses technology customer employee and creator, It is the latest demonstration. And ServiceNow's product and engineering machine is the best the world the best-in-class, like no other. And speaking of best-in-class I've been lucky enough to one of the greatest innovative in the 21st Century. Fred Ludington I have been on a multi year journey together, one built on and mutual respect. At this week's Board meeting I was honored to take on the role of Chairman, whit Fred remaining and active member of our Board for the long-term remains the inspiration of ServiceNow and, I'm honored to call our Founder and my personal friend.

In conclusion, we again delivered on our promise in Q3. We said the company would continue its fast growth in any operating environment. We did. We said the cRPO growth will accelerate during H2 as our Q4 guidance reflects it is. We said that we preserve the benchmark near the real 60 for the full-year in constant-currency.

We are on-track. ServiceNow is a revenue growth predictability of growth and sustainable business model. While others are managing and path our engineers are innovating for the future. The fundamental question facing enterprises to day is this 10 modernization. With the robust demand environment we see, the answer is compelling, no it cannot the stated ambition of ServiceNow remains. We will be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. We are firmly committed to that journey, we are focused on value-creation for our customers our partners our colleagues and our shareholders.

Our confidence in Q4 extends to 2023 and beyond. Sales capacity and pipeline coverage are higher today than at any point this (Technical Difficulty). We have best-in-class sales and marketing efficiency, we have a highly-differentiated platform, we have a business model that will be managed by design. For net-new innovation, growth and profitability, you can count on us.

With this growth in margin profile, operating near rule of 60, ServiceNow is a unique asset and a premier company. We are hiring with an absolute focus on people, who can innovate through code and who can sell solutions and who can help customers realize success. The bottom-line is this, when our customers work, the world works better for everyone. That's why the world works with ServiceNow.

If we didn't do what we do, it wouldn't get done. The hallmark for ServiceNow its net new innovation. And with that in mind I thank you so much and, I'll hand things over to Gina.

Gina Mastantuono{BIO 16430022 <GO>}
Thank you, Bill. Q3 was a, fantastic quarter of execution. The team delivered strong results, beating all of our constant-currency growth and operating margin guidance metrics, an outstanding performance across-the-board. Investments in digital transformation are necessity and ServiceNow remains a strategic priority.

CEOs recognized that the Now Platform can deliver the workflow needs for their digital-first initiative, while driving quick time to value and hard dollar savings, these outcomes are imperative in the current macroenvironment and while we continue to see robust demand for our products.

In Q3 subscription revenues were $1.742 billion, growing 28.5% Year-over-Year in constant-currency exceeding the high-end of our guidance range by 100 basis-points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $11.4 billion, representing 24.5% Year-over-Year constant-currency growth (inaudible) RPO was approximately $5.87 billion, representing 25% year-over-Year constant-currency growth, 150-basis-points beat versus our FX-adjusted guidance.

50 basis-points of the beat [ph] was driven by early renewals from Q4, as the team look to get ahead of our large renewal cohort. Our renewal rate was the best-in class 98%, continuing to demonstrate the stickiness of our business, as the Now Platform remains a missing critical part of our customer's operations. We finished the quarter with 1,530 customers paying us over one million in ACV, up f 22% Year-over-Year. The number of customers paying us over $10 million in ACV grew 60% Year-over-Year as our cohort expansion remains healthy.

From an industry perspective, net-new ACV growth was led by retail and hospitality, up nearly 50%, followed by strength in education. Manufacturing had a good quarter as well led by a large eight-digit deal and Technology Media and Telecom continue to show durability. Federal had its best quarter ever, including in over $20 million net-new ACV wins. We closed 69 deals greater than $1million in the quarter including five with new logos. What's more, each of those five deals were led by a different product. That diversification showcases the breadth of our product portfolio, an increasing customer awareness of ServiceNow capabilities, as a platform which includes 11 organic businesses with over $200 million in ACV. In fact, 18 of our top-20 deals contain five or more products.

Turning to profitability, operating margin was 26%, 1 point above our guidance, driven by our (Technical Difficulty) and operating efficiencies. Our free cash flow margin was 6%. We ended the quarter with a healthy balance sheet, including $5.5 billion in cash and investments. Together these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth and profitability.

Before, I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro. Our ability to outperform in Q3 is a testament to the strong execution of the ServiceNow team, account executives are staying close to the customer, constantly checking in and proactively assembling the necessary materials to get deals across the line. We will operate with the same rigor in Q4 and are confident that we're factoring in the macro trend into our guidance.

Consistent with the market on a Year-over-Year basis the strengthening of the US dollar also resulted in incremental FX headwinds. We now expect a $290 million headwind to 2020 subscription revenues, a $330 million headwind to Q4 cRPO, 100 basis points headwind to operating margin and approximately $160 million or 100-basis point headwind to free cash flow margin between 2022.

With that in mind, let's turn to our 2022 outlook. We are revising our subscription revenues range to between $6.865 billion and $6.870 billion, representing a raise to our Year-over-Year constant-currency growth outlook to 28.5% excluding a 550 basis-point FX headwind. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 86%, up 100 basis-points Year-over-Year. We continue to expect an operating margin of 25% consistent with our original guidance at the beginning of the year as we are offsetting incremental FX headwinds with operational efficiencies and disciplined spend management. We now, expect free cash flow margin of 29%, reflecting incremental FX headwinds I previously noted.

Despite the $116 million impact to FX [ph] we will generate over $2.1 billion in free-cash flow, demonstrating the incredible resilience of our business model. Finally, we expect GAAP-diluted weighted-average outstanding shares of $203 million. For Q4 we expect subscription revenues between $1.834 billion and $1.839 billion representing 26%, 27% Year-over-Year growth on a constant-currency basis, excluding a 600-basis point FX headwind. We expect cRPO growth of 26% on a constant currency basis, excluding 600 basis points of FX headwinds.

We expect an operating margin of 26% and we expect $204 million GAAP-diluted weighted-average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, we had a fantastic Q3, I'm so proud of our people being focused, disciplined and committed to helping our customers succeed. Bill and I would like to thank all of our employees around the globe for their continued hard work and dedication.

Our business is resilient, our teams are delivering and we're as confident, as ever about the future. We have the platform enterprises need to reinvent their business models to adapt to the new economy, so they can innovate to win and come out of this moment stronger than ever. We continue to see a robust pipeline and are maintaining our investments in growth higher, as the opportunity in front of us remains large. We're well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.

With that, I'll open it up for Q&A.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you very much Ms. Mastantuono. (Operator Instructions). We'll go first this afternoon to Samad Samana at Jefferies.

Q - Samad Samana{BIO 17883999 <GO>}
Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Its great to see the strong results. Bill, Maybe I'll start with you. You've been telling us as you noted on the call that that ServiceNow can grow durably regardless of the environment. I'm just wondering if maybe either the shape or the nature of the conversation that you're having with executives has changed in this type of environment and how that's ultimately still allowing you to close all of these large deals and make (inaudible) momentum?

A - Bill McDermott{BIO 3075298 <GO>}
Yeah. I think, Gina said it very well, Samad, when we said we're mission-critical and the Now Platform has really become the standard for digital transformation in a modern enterprise today and we're solving so many challenges. Our customers need to drive automation and productivity. As you know they either not hiring, they're laying people off and they have to do more with less we're built for that. They need the computers and the platforms to do the work, so the people who have a more pleasant experience on the employee side and they require an experience no matter where they are working from that's world-class, we take care of that.

The customer service management has evolved from just the engagement layer how I market to you, sell you, cross-sell you, it's really moved into the middle office and back-office and back into the supply-chain on how

I can streamline with great efficiency giving you the right product and the right form factor-in price on-time just as you expected it. And that end-to-end is all about the ServiceNow platform and finally you're seeing a breakthrough here on building net-new innovation customers are going to have to do that for themselves and with partners and we are also going into a co-creation model with our partners in every industry and geo around the world. That's pretty stunning and there's lots of use cases and examples. The big thing, Samad, is the C-Level executives are looking to ServiceNow. They are calling us, they want to work with us they see that we're the defining one and that took some time to build and I think we're there now.

Q - Samad Samana{BIO 17883999 <GO>}
Although growth is incredibly impressive and Gina maybe just a quick follow-up for you on the comment around factoring macro and can you, just help us understand last quarter you called out slightly longer deal cycles -- any change can you just dimensionalize what you factored in from a macro perspective as it relates to maybe deal cycles or close rates? Thank you so much.

A - Gina Mastantuono{BIO 16430022 <GO>}
Yeah. It's a great question and certainly we are not immune to the macro environment and we're certainly not blind to what's happening around us. Our ability to execute despite the macro is quite astounding and I give amazing kudos to our incredible sales organization around the world. We are staying close to our customers than ever before, checking in with them making sure we understand the levels of approval that they need to go through making sure that we understand what they need to get that deal across the line, we will maintain that level of rigor that you've seen us do in Q3. And so while, certainly there is more -- there is more outlook on deals that are getting close and, there's more people are looking at deals closer, but we are closing them, close rate the stronger and we feel really good about how we put that all into our guidance and so macro is evolving, but our sales force is saying so close to our customers and really driving superb execution.

Q - Samad Samana{BIO 17883999 <GO>}
Great. Congrats.

A - Bill McDermott{BIO 3075298 <GO>}
Thank you.

A - Gina Mastantuono{BIO 16430022 <GO>}
Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We go next now to Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse.

Q - Phil Winslow{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on just and awesome quarter. Bill one of the things that you mentioned during your comments sales capacity has never been higher and never has and the coverage ratio for the year has not been higher this is even on the context of growing sales and marketing head count 30% my question to you is, this is where the biggest net add quarters in terms of employees in sales and marketing this year and over the past couple of years. You usually don't see a lot of salespeople moving to a new company in Q3, but they're doing that to ServiceNow would you talk to these new employees and your and your management team, what are they saying about why they coming to ServiceNow and Gina you talked about continuing to invest in go-to-market there you obviously hit 30% growth in Q3 how should we, think about the exit-rate for this year? Thanks.

A - Bill McDermott{BIO 3075298 <GO>}
Well, Phil, thank you very much for your kind remarks also the question. If you kind of marks also the question if you, think about the first-quarter of the year the economies in the world really weren't shaking everything is going very well. And especially a tech company like ServiceNow, people are very desirous of having our people too, but we still whether that and we continue to hire. And obviously the people that he hired in the second and the third quarter the beauty of that is they're now becoming truly productive. And certified to execute at a level that we would consider statistical relevant for moving the needle. And that's where I come with my max capacity It's not just based on the, number of people, but it's based upon their readiness to enter into the customer relationship with the level of proficiency so they can execute at a high-level. That's what, I'm talking about when we're there now and were there on stronger than we were all year long, Phil, so it's an absolute numbers but it's also readiness and it's in the pipeline. And the coverage in the pipeline is better all those dials look great in terms of why people come here, they come here for the culture. They know that this is all about net-new innovation it's all about customer-centricity and brilliant execution and it's a politically free environment we, just want to win. And, people want to be a part of a winning organization.

A - Gina Mastantuono{BIO 16430022 <GO>}
And then on your question on actual sales and marketing higher, Bill, yes. ServiceNow is hiring and will continue to hire and are investing for growth, so we are absolutely committed to continuing to build-up our World-class go-to-market organization. And all about driving long-term growth and ensuring that we also are continuing to drive ramped rev productivity. Really it's really about ensuring that the opportunity that we see in front of us that, our sales and go-to-market teams are ready to drive that growth that we continue to see, so you'll see us continue to grow our sales quota-bearing especially we'll will also be hiring our, critical engineering Head, we are very much open for hiring please critical growth higher.

A - Bill McDermott{BIO 3075298 <GO>}
And one thing, Phil. I just don't want to fall between the cracks is the million, and the rise up with ServiceNow campaign where we're going to hire them. Some of them will end-up getting hired, of course, but we're going to train them for our customers. For our partners and to ServiceNow, so it is a bold move for one million. ServiceNow training professionals to put them into the growth engine of ServiceNow and that'll be done on a global basis we see bold moves that need to be taken in, India, Japan, Korea and continued expansion in Europe we just have a tireless appetite for growth.

Q - Phil Winslow{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Excellent. Congrats again and thanks for taking my question.

A - Bill McDermott{BIO 3075298 <GO>}
Thank you, Phil.

Operator
Thank you. We go next now to Sterling Auty at MoffettNathanson.

Q - Sterling Auty{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
Yeah. Thanks. Hi guys. My question is when you look at the large deal activity in the quarter and the pipeline, how much of that is actually replacing legacy architectures to save money in this tough budget environment we're heading into and how much of it is about that automation to drive increased productivity?

A - Bill McDermott{BIO 3075298 <GO>}
Thank you, Sterling. It's interesting question. It's always important to reinforce. That the 20th century architectures we're heavily invested in by our customers. And our desire is not to replace them. Our desire is to make them more relevant so they deliver modern value and a highly agile and experience-oriented way for employees customers and partners. So underlying systems some of them that are point solutions and they never should have been there in the first place, they do disappear.

The core large well-known brands systems they remain, but with the agility of the ServiceNow platform above them and our ability to automate the workflows and completely change the experience set. We're now reinventing the way supply chains run for the biggest auto manufacturers in the world. We are now taking procurement management, to an entirely new level of procurement and finance organizations have Greg retailers, manufacturers on freight companies around the world. There were double-digit wins doing this for some of the largest companies in the world, so they are taking out huge costs. They aren't getting rid of point solutions, they're keeping the main ones and then they're automating the speed and agility and value on the ServiceNow platform.

The business cases are unbelievable. It makes want to ask you know why are we so generous with our pricing if they can get 1 billion, can we get a little more? That's the situation we're in here.

Q - Sterling Auty{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
Thank you.

Operator
We'll go next now to Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.

Q - Keith Weiss{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Excellent. Thank you for taking the question and. Bill congratulations on the new Chairman position and congratulations on a great quarter in a difficult environment, my question actually for Gina. You guys did a tremendous job in driving operating margins at the same time you're hiring to plan, right? And he was still aggressively hiring. Can you, one, talk to us a, little bit about where you're seeing the efficiencies and sort where you able to kind of drive that up incremental productivity out-of-the entire ServiceNow. And, two. I wondering if you could touch on free-cash flow a little bit. It has been getting more seasonal over the years this is the lowest free-cash flow margin we've seen in quite some time where the FX impact was increased seasonality if you, could just give us any kind of visibility in terms of what happened on that side of the equation?

A - Gina Mastantuono{BIO 16430022 <GO>}
Yeah. Absolutely great question, so really proud of the fact that despite about 100 basis-points of FX impact on our operating margins, we're able to hold them flat with our original guidance at the beginning of the year, while at the same time still hiring for quota-bearing go-to-market fingers on keyboards and engineers, right?

And the efficiencies that we're seeing are across the board. So if you, think about leverage in mid and back-office G&A leverage on the marketing side of things. If you think about really what our incredible cloud infrastructure team is able to drive with respect to efficiencies even in this macro-environment it's pretty remarkable. And so the, other thing is that our platform drives efficiency for ourselves.

We are the customer 0 for all of our new product innovation so our platform enables those efficiencies across-the-board so that's the other big lever that we, always have to play here, so feel really great about the fact that, we've been able to drive those efficiencies, even through this current macro-environment. With respect to free-cash flow, absolutely, so Q3 in general is a lower so period we have our mid-year bonus payout. We have bonds interest payout. But we also have seen pretty big FX impact in the quarter and for the remainder of the year so we talked about a 100 basis-points impact speak margin that we're not able to absorb this year, because truly the impact on collections happened all at one whether the FX impact on your P&L, because of the ratable way that we recognize revenue and OpEx happened over a period of time.

And so underlying health of cash flow remains great. We're obviously as we talked about staying close to our customers and giving them some leeway on payment terms if they need it what, I can tell you is that days, as opposed to weeks and so we are really staying close to the customers the trajectory of free-cash flow accretion over-time remains the same.

Q - Keith Weiss{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. So, it sounds like much more linearity and FX headwinds and any significance change in invoicing terms or payment terms.

A - Gina Mastantuono{BIO 16430022 <GO>}
Exactly, Exactly.

Q - Keith Weiss{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Awesome. Very clear. Thank you, very much.

Thank you. We'll go next -- now to Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.

Q - Matt Hedberg{BIO 16655531 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys, Bill, Gina, great quarter. Bill I had a question for you. You've made some previous advances in observability quite step-in this quarter you acquired Era Software which looks like a great addition to the platform can you talk about sort of what the integration plans are there and sort of maybe refresh, what this means for your broader observability efforts?

A - Bill McDermott{BIO 3075298 <GO>}
Yeah. Absolutely. Thank you very much for the question, Matt. Basically if you look at what we're trying to do here we are bringing a scalable cloud-native log management solution and database that complements Lightstep's existing solutions to the world and this is really exemplifying and accelerating our vision, which is essentially to unify telemetry logs metrics and traces and now deliver that truly unified observability workflow on one platform and this is going to take huge cost out of the equation and it's going to bring much greater experience to all users involved because they'll avoid the confusing context switches they, have to do now. So all the integration work that is necessary, is being done it is all integrated back onto the Now Platform and is a roadmap to do that but right now we're extremely happy with the way Ben is leading Era Software where it just makes us stronger and we're super-excited about the future of this business when it can be. It's going to be interesting to watch this thing play-out.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Hey, guys thanks for taking the question. Bill, I don't think we've heard you say the words procurement and supply chain more often than you have on this earnings call. And I guess, I wanted to dive into that, because after seeing SAP's results after what Oracle was talking about, it does feel like, there is like a deferred amount of activity that's getting done in the back-office and I just want to see your take on kind of participating in that activity as you're talking about that driving it seems like some pretty material wins in the quarter. And then I guess, maybe a follow-up for Gina is around linearity in the quarter and also if there's a way to quantify the federal business, seems like did again at the best quarter ever. Just how much of that was upfront kind of self-hosted revenue recognition?

A - Bill McDermott{BIO 3075298 <GO>}
Alex, first of all let me thank you for your question, you're right, there's quite a bit that has to be done in the back office to automate business processes for a new world order of things in the macro so, you're 100% right it's, still early days but I see a massive opportunity given how much enterprise is and spend on ERP today. And if you look at procurement and supplier lifecycle management solutions that make it possible for customers to unify these transactional systems and enable them through workflow capabilities, that truly drive efficiency and the user experience and the consumer-grade aspect of ServiceNow is really coming front and center, because these transactional systems, they all work fine. If you're a power user or a super user.

But when you start to get more people collaboratively involved in a process there is a demand now consumer-grade UX and there's nothing that works better than workflow automation to solve some of these problems, So we are providing a collaborative platform for all the stakeholders in an enterprise. And that a consistent user experience it's our super power and I do want to underscore we are not interested or trying to replace the transactional systems of the brands that you mentioned. Those were wonderful companies and they do something that's very important.

What we are responding to is the agility of the supply chain and how you can reoriented and a record speed, because that's what this world order is asking for how you can rethink suppliers to manage different labor issues, whether it's an arbitrage or just buying from the people you should be based on your ESG efforts. When you MWBE spend and many other things that many customers care a lot about ESG is a big thing. They're doing that all on the workflow automation context of ServiceNow and they love the fact that we integrate with everybody and we're not at war with anybody because on the side of the customer and that's what we should all be doing.

And on your question, Alex, on linearity in the quarter. We actually had great linearity in Q3, our best ever, really, really pleased with how the sales organization is again staying really close to the customer. Federal business had its best quarter ever this year and Q3 and outperformed. We had 16 deals over a $1 million one of which closed with over $20 million of net-new ACV.

Federal also saw great linearity in the quarter really because the platform is demonstrating such strong ROI that is really enabling them to get through the approval process faster. We're really seeing increase in the volume of federal agencies that are really looking at their partnership with ServiceNow through an enterprise lens, right, for those deals are getting bigger, more strategic, more multi-year and we're seeing cabinet level agencies really trying to consolidate contract enterprise level with us and standardize it on the Now Platform. So federal team doing incredible work with their customers.

With respect to hosted, we had about 3% this year -- sorry this quarter, which is flat quarter-on-quarter, but down 1% from last year Q3. And so really great linearity across the board hosted flat quarter-over quarter, but down 1 point Year-over-Year, which is actually a headwind to that revenue growth, which means our revenue growth is even stronger, so really, really great results across the board.

Thank you. We take our next question now from Kash Rangan at Goldman Sachs.

Q - Kash Rangan{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations. And what has changed from the Microsoft earnings conference call yesterday, Bill. I wanted to get your perspective. You talked about the great reprioritization Microsoft talked about how some new cloud workloads are being passed by the customers and they optimizing existing workloads. So, I just wanted to see what is it that is different about the prioritization of ServiceNow in the face of other headwinds that we're starting to hear about in the public cloud and how does this position the company for 2023 looking into a more uncertain time we all thought we're going to have a recession '22, we sort of escaped it maybe it happens in '23 maybe doesn't how the grade reprioritization did you talked about our customers viewing the value proposition, return on investment on ServiceNow relative to the cost-of-capital and Gina if you could care how would you be approaching calendar '23 guidance so, you're going to be more conservative than usual given the risks in the environment that we all appreciate it? Thank you so much.

A - Bill McDermott{BIO 3075298 <GO>}
Yeah. Kash. Markets are very rational, customers are extremely focused right now. On productivity, they care a lot about their customers and their employees and obviously their bottom lines and no platform in the enterprise software industry gets done what they want faster. From creating great experiences for their employees you can customer three star Michelin experience and you first energize your employees. So that's one aspect of it they know they, have to have more productive happy people the cost of turnover and problems in the workforce it's a huge, huge bottom-line hit that a, lot of people don't factor into the equation and a lot of it's caused by bad onboarding bed systems. And not really a great user experience for the people who work for their company from anywhere they want to be. And as it relates to the customer I touched on that. I think what we're adding on customer service management right now with the completeness of our vision is stunning in terms of value-creation and a big surprise to customers who didn't use to think of ServiceNow in that space and now they do.

And as it relates to our core IT, I mean we're obviously believer there, so not going go into great details on that but they blown away by the San Diego release in March and the Tokyo release in October they know is an immediate cycle from what they need and how quickly we can engineer it and get it into the release level. So, the existing customers love that that they have this incredible seamless experience with ServiceNow they know the innovation is coming on-time and at the highest-level of quality. And finally I think and that platform level the need for speed cash is everything getting these business cases rational getting these customers up and running swiftly and demonstrating immediate business value is the essential ingredient. I didn't give you one example and the ERP world where we did not get these customers live in, more than 100 days. So we're talking we're talking need for speed and and we're talking ability to deliver and the customers having great experiences. You can find a customer in the global economy it doesn't love the platform, I keep trying. I still can't find them.

A - Gina Mastantuono{BIO 16430022 <GO>}
And Kash, on your question with respect to 2023, obviously, will provide more detail on 2023 in January. Overall as you are hearing from our tone the demand that we're seeing for the Now Platform has remained resilient and strong FX as you know has become a significant headwind, particularly over the last three months. Since the beginning of this year we now see about a $400 million headwind related to FX in 2023. And we certainly don't think the macro-environment is all the spending to change as we enter into 2023. So when we, think about guidance we'll be taking all of these factors into account as you would, expect us to.

Q - Kash Rangan{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Thank you so much. Congrats again.

And we'll go next now to you Brad Sills of Bank of America.

Q - Brad Sills{BIO 15854296 <GO>}
Oh, great thanks guys. I wanted to ask about an update quickly on the SI channel. I think Bill in the past, you've said seven or eight of the top 10 global SIs with $1 billion plus pipeline that's just an astounding number when you think just a, few years ago that channel was almost non-existent so just, curious how much of their productivity is contributing to your results here today. How do they give you that reach into these other departments that historically ServiceNow hasn't been in, obviously you're talking about ERP and back-office creator employee customer you're seeing a ton of momentum there just. Just, wanted to get your thoughts on how important that channel is in bringing you into those types of opportunities and the traction you're seeing there?

A - Bill McDermott{BIO 3075298 <GO>}
Brad, Brad it's a great question. And, look, it was done very interesting in the early days just opening people's minds so the power of the Now Platform. And our global partner ecosystem is obviously a meaningful enabler and they're critical for us to drive successful implementations for our customers and also to tailor our products. To different industries so this idea of co-creation whether it's for an industry it's for a sub-industry vertical and even at a micro vertical level. We've only scratched the surface of what's possible with the ecosystem we're young in terms of the runway for growth.

As it relates to the top ones, we now have 8 of the top 10 global advisory and systems integrators that have committed to a plan, greater than billion which ServiceNow. And again I'm very open to the ecosystem and that's why you see us making a bold move today on RYZOLT with ServiceNow to skill of million. I know I on the covid but it is what it is I'm sure it will be $2 million because is such demand for the platform and I really want our partners to love and trust ServiceNow as we love and trust them. Because it really is about mutual goal setting. It's about making sure we're very clear about who is doing what and we don't duplicate efforts and we never disappoint our partners it's all about trust. And they like us because with straight shooters here and we want to win and they want to win. and the other thing that's happening is, they have like the cashless point on the great reprioritization. There's is going to be some much spend that will go-around. But what they all realized now is business impact is what it's all about especially in this macro. And then more-and-more reaching deep into the ServiceNow relationship, because the customers won't listen to long-drawn out expensive, time-consuming, multi year projects. If that project is and in the same calendar year the likelihood of getting approved is real low. And if you remember in 2008 that was the era where everyone moved away from CapEx to OpEx and that was we have the cloud got the big tailwind. Well now you know you got, half of amendment [ph] cloud, so they're looking at OpEx and that OpEx question is, which platform can get me through the winning equation the fastest and which platform is going to be around 10 years from now to be a dominant force in my infrastructure and that's where ServiceNow seems to be the bell.

Q - Brad Sills{BIO 15854296 <GO>}

We'll go next now to Mark Murphy of JPMorgan.

Q - Mark Murphy{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
Yes thank you, very much. I'll add my congrats on a, fantastic quarter. So, Bill, how broad are your ambitions in the employee workflows market I believe you had crossed $500 million there some of your partners, seem to have 20% or 30% of their pipeline in HR and now you have you have this Hitch Works asset for talent intelligence and skills so just curious how broad is that multi year roadmap at this point?

A - Bill McDermott{BIO 3075298 <GO>}
Yeah it's real -- first of all thank you for the question, Mark. it's really broad. If you look at employee workflows, 12 of our top-20 deals. And we had seven deals greater than $1 million and what we're helping customers do really is navigate this uncertainty that they're dealing with and they've got to give these employees that they have no matter where they work a great experience. And it's not only limited to I would say recruiting, hiring, onboarding, training and certifying providing all the services that the employee needs on one mobile app. And that includes offboarding employees in a first-class way which most companies to get to do, which really hurts their brand image. We care about all that but in addition in addition to all of that we're now in a world where customers are really pulling out because they're like hey, I'm not going to have as many people. And I really got to think about right reorienting my business processes are rethinking how I automate things that I just haven't gotten to yet but, I need to do a quick so our ambitions are always in the billions. And this is another business where we are in billions. And I think we're just getting started on the employee experience journey and I'll tell you what, if you look at even ourselves, there isn't a single employee in this company that could tell you a single system of record that might be in the infrastructure somewhere in our cloud. They have no idea but what they do know like Gina said earlier, everything that they do is on a mobile application on their phone and if ServiceNow because we completely workflow automated the entire corporation. So they don't know anything else.

And what we're constantly hearing is people want to join, because they're on-boarding experience is so great and we don't lose employees, we have gotten a lots of employees joining here they have literally bonds that of another company in a week, because they could stand the onboarding experience and so this isn't for me. So, everything having to do with the employee experience and the management experience, we launched and the Tokyo release a complete Manager solution. So we can manage their careers, their hierarchy of their training and development and they can also do that with their employees on the Now Platform and all this is happening in Real-time, so the system of record began we're not interested in being one of those and we have no quarrel with any of them we are interested in the experience and that's where the money is.

Thank you. We go next now to John of Guggenheim.

Q - John DiFucci{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Thank you, Bill we've done a, lot of work on the US government opportunity and new Gina both mentioned the record results there in this quarter. As you know this is the fiscal fourth-quarter for the government and likely the strongest spending quarter of the year for that customer vertical. I guess it's a vertical can you talk about the opportunity for any spillover into next quarter, or even next year, or is this really sort of a user lose it mentality is that something you can avoid in this vertical so it's always going to be material just like a third-quarter thing.

A - Bill McDermott{BIO 3075298 <GO>}
Yeah John thank you for the question. We have always been really strong and federal. And a lot of that is driven by productivity, efficiency and government organizations and I think we can all agree that that's a big opportunity. So that area of focus for us has always been a priority the budget there is large and there's a, lot of demand for updating the technology environment for governments, what they love about ServiceNow is we integrate the things that, they've already done. And we're not and a debate about whether the past was done properly or not the customer can decide how they retire point solutions by the bundles but we don't insist upon that we are driving the experience and, I can tell you with great confidence, John. We have a, very strong pipeline going into the fourth quarter with more multimillion dollar deals. And I couldn't be prouder or more confident in our team.

Q - John DiFucci{BIO 4099352 <GO>}

Q - Karl Keirstead{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Okay great, I'll ask a quick one for Gina. Gina did that pull-forward phenomenon that you cited in 3Q continue into the fourth-quarter such that it's shaping up to perhaps be a, little bit more front-end loaded in terms of renewal timing than you would have expected? Thank you.

A - Gina Mastantuono{BIO 16430022 <GO>}
So, I talked about the fact that one of the reasons why our cRPO in Q3 was related to 50 basis-points of pull forwards of Q4 renewals into Q3 and if you remember on prior calls, I've talked about the fact that this Q4 was a large renewal cohort because the fact that, we were able to get some of them done early absolutely help drive cRPO, but ramp our revenue beat as well expectation is that our Q4 renewal will be on (inaudible) we had 90% renewal rate in Q3 we expect similar levels in Q4 and so feel very good about the pace of renewals for the remainder of the year.

Q - Karl Keirstead{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you, Gina.

Q - Michael Turits{BIO 1720659 <GO>}
Hey, thanks very much. Congrats on a good job so maybe to continue in that vein. My understanding is the expectation for the cRPO increase primarily predicated on renewals and at par as opposed to expansion so can you comment on how expansion have been going both on the early renewals and prospects for those we expect to renew in 4Q.

A - Gina Mastantuono{BIO 16430022 <GO>}
Yeah. Great question, Michael. Expansion rate you know we don't give expansion rates anymore on a quarterly basis, but we reported last year expansion rate of 125% and we've seen very strong similar expansion rate throughout 2022.
