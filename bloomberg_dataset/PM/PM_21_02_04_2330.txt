Emmanuel Babeau{BIO 4114796 <GO>}
Thank you, Nick. And welcome ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call is safe and well. Our business delivered a robust performance in 2020 despite the unprecedented challenges of the global pandemic. Most impressive was the continued strong growth of IQOS which made up over 10% of our volumes and almost 1/4 of our net revenues for the year.

The daily consumption of HTUs by IQOS' user saw minimal impact from social restriction. And despite a significant constraint, we were able to continue acquiring new user in switching from cigarettes at a very good pace to reach a total of 17.6 million, of which 12.7 million have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking.

HTU shipment volumes grew 28% compared to the prior year. We'll recall market shares in key IQOS geographies in Q4. Moreover, 10 markets exited 2020 with double-digit national share in December. Our rate of user acquisition was again strong in Q4, propelled by the increasing sophistication of our digital commercial model and the positive word of mouth effect from this increasing prominence despite tighter restrictions in a number of markets.

The most significant pandemic related headwinds we faced were in the combustible business with the highest impact in duty-free in Southeast Asia, where we also faced additional challenges in Indonesia, due to the excise tax structure. The least impacted region with the EU. While the timing and duration of the recovery remain uncertain, we expect a rebound in industry volumes over the next one to two years as the pandemic recedes.

Despite these challenges, our operating margins were again significantly ahead in the fourth quarter and the full year. This reflects the increasing weight and profitability of IQOS, and the delivery of our three-year cost-efficiency target one year ahead of schedule, which also enable reinvestment in the business. This drove excellent EPS growth and cash generation where we also exceeded our prior targets.

From a product standpoint, we broadened our smoke-free portfolio with a wider range of consumables such as HEETS Dimensions and Fiit, and the launch of IQOS VEEV in e-vapor and (inaudible). We also continue to make good progress around the world on the recognition of the positive impact of switching smokers to scientifically substantiated RRPs. The FDA's Modified Risk Tobacco Product authorization of a version of IQOS was a major milestone in this regard. This was also followed by the pre-market authorization of the IQOS 3 device in December.

Turning now to the headline numbers. Our full-year net revenue declined by 1.6% on an organic basis, this was an exceptionally resilient performance in the context of the pandemic. We estimate that duty-free net of facial[ph] volume recapture in local markets and Indonesia alone were a mid-single digit drag on our topline. Despite these factors, we saw strong organic growth of 6.9% in our net revenue per unit driven by the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix.

Combustible tobacco pricing was plus 3.7% reflecting solid pricing in many markets, partially offset by headwinds in Indonesia. Excluding Indonesia, combustible pricing was around plus 6%. Despite the decline in organic net revenue and combustible volumes, our adjusted operating income margin increased by 240 basis points on an organic basis. This reflect the positive impact of IQOS on both our gross margin and the ratio of SG&A to net revenue, which I will come back to. The resulting 7% adjusted diluted organic EPS growth exceeds our previous guidance of around 6% and also reflect a strong end to the year in Japan.

This brings me on to the fourth quarter, which had a very similar dynamic to the full-year. Organic net revenue declined by 3.5%. While a significant improvement from the decline of almost 10% in Q2, continued weakness in Indonesia and duty-free, and the lower total market in the Philippines including price increase effect more than offset a strong performance from IQOS. Our net revenue per unit again increased solidly by 5.2% due to the same factors as the full year. Our adjusted operating income margin expanded by 200 basis points to deliver plus 7.4% adjusted diluted EPS growth, all on an organic basis.

Before we turn back to the full year, I will now expand on the strong underlying Q4 dynamic in little more detail. Our HTU shipment volumes continued to show strong growth and reached a record 21.7 billion units, driven by the EU region, Japan and Russia. In Japan, the industry was weak as expected, as consumer and trade diluting following the October tax-driven price increase, led to a 13% decline in the total tobacco market, including cigarillos. We outperformed these trends significantly as a strong finish for IQOS of tech[ph] and share gave rise to higher shipment for both in quarter sell-out and to provide appropriate inventory for a strong expected start to 2021.

With social restriction starting to tighten towards the end of the quarter in a number of markets in response to a second wave of the pandemic, combustible volumes, and revenue saw some impact from reduced mobility and social occasion, albeit to a significantly lesser degree than the second quarter. Nonetheless, the strengths of the IQOS business enabled the EU, Eastern Europe, and East Asia and Australia region to deliver mid-single-digit topline growth. Elsewhere, the continued challenges in Indonesia and duty-free against a tough comparison and a lower total market in the Philippines in the immediate aftermath of a price increase weighed on revenue growth.

Despite the ongoing restriction in many markets in the first quarter of 2021 and a tough prior-year comparison, we expect better top-line performance which I'll come back to later. Let me now go into the drivers of our 2020 margin expansion, starting with gross margin, which expanded by 200-basis point on an organic basis. This is driven by multiple levers.

First, our ongoing transformation is delivering an increasing mix of IQOS' consumable in our business. Second is pricing on combustible. Third is our focus on overall manufacturing and supply chain productivity which compensated for lower combustible volume exacerbated by impact of the pandemic, in addition to inflation, investment, and extraordinary COVID-related costs in our supply chain.

Gross margin expansion was augmented by our focus on SG&A efficiency with our adjusted marketing administration and research cost 40 basis points lower as a percentage of net revenue on an organic basis. This reflect the ongoing digitalization and simplification of our business processes, including our IQOS commercial engine and more efficient ways of working.

A clear focus on cost efficiency allows us to improve profitability while continuing to invest in the growth of IQOS. I am very pleased to report that we have already achieved our 2019, 2021 target of over $1 billion in annualized gross saving in only two years with $1.1 billion delivered by the end of 2020. Over 2/3 of the savings came from manufacturing and supply chain productivity and device cost, where our focus on efficiency, quality, and footprint more than offset inflation, supply chain investment, extraordinary COVID-related cost and the effect of lower combustible volumes. The remainder came from commercial efficiency and G&A cost.

Importantly, this savings do not include loss resulting from the pandemic such as reduced travel and the necessary shift of consumer to digital channels. Between higher manufacturing cost and SG&A saving such as these, we estimate a net efficiency of around $150 million due to COVID-effect. We plan to elaborate further on our cost initiative and the fueling of IQOS growth at next week's investor day.

The strong uplift in our profitability and excellent earnings growth allowed us to deliver nearly $10 billion in operating cash flow for the year, well above our expectation of at least $9 billion. This represent 3.5% like-for-like ex-currency growth and also reflects ongoing working capital initiatives, an impressive performance in the year with significant disruption to global supply chain.

Our capital expenditures amounted to $0.6 billion, below our historic run rate. Significant improvement in manufacturing performance have translated into lower ongoing requirements. However, we also benefited from the timing of certain investment and expect CapEx of around $0.8 billion in 2021. Aside from reinvesting in the business, the primary use of cash is on return to shareholders and we raised the quarterly dividend this year to an annualized rate of $4.80 per share. Capital allocation is another topic we will cover at Investor Day.

I turn now to industry volumes, which declined by around 6% in 2020, excluding the US and China. This compares to the historic average of a 2% to 3% decline. We estimate the 3% to 4% difference is almost entirely attributable to the effect of the COVID pandemic on the combustible category. As is evident in our results, the smoke-free category has displayed remarkable resilience reflecting its convenience and suitability for different use occasions.

As we have covered in prior quarters, lower daily consumption in combustible has been driven by two main factors. First, the reduction in usage occasion during confinement, especially in markets with a large amount of daily wage worker. And second, the reduced amount of social occasion due to closure of hospitality settings and restriction on social gatherings. Duty-free also remains depressed in line with global travel.

We have seen a partial recovery in daily consumption since the most severe period of reduced mobility in Q2, and we expect a gradual improvement as the pandemic recedes. As we all know, there remains considerable uncertainty on the speed, shape, and timing of exiting the pandemic. And at present many countries are experiencing a serious resurgence in infections.

However, based on our recent experience with renewed lockdown situation, we do not expect to see a repeat of the severe drop in consumption of Q2 2020. However, it is uncertain if any rebound will occur this year, so we assume the historic average decline of 2% to 3% to be the floor for industry trends in 2021. I'll come back to this when discussing guidance assumptions.

Turning now to our volume performance. Weak combustible industry volumes were compounded by our exposure to Indonesia and duty-free, and the over-indexing of our premium portfolio to social consumption occasions. It follows that as pandemic recedes, we should see a better dynamic in our market share and I'll come to this point shortly.

As expected, quarterly fluctuation[ph] in inventory level were even out over the year with no significant difference between our IMS and shipments. The clear highlight in our volume performance was the shipment of 76.1 billion HTUs in 2020. This was just above the upper end of our previously communicated 75 billion to 76 billion range and represent 28% growth over the prior year. HTU net revenues increased by plus 33% on an organic basis, partly reflecting positive mix. We remain well on track to deliver on our target of 90 billion to 100 billion units this year and we will have more to say on the outlook beyond 2021 next week.

This strong performance from IQOS means that each of the tobacco units made up over 10% of our total shipment volume in 2020 and over 12% in the fourth quarter as compared to approximately 8% in the year of 2019 and 5% in 2018. We continue to expect this proportion to grow over time as the positive momentum on IQOS continues, providing a powerful driver of revenue and margin growth.

Our sales mix is changing rapidly. Smoke-free product made up 26% of our total net revenue in the fourth quarter. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 7% of the $6.8 billion of RRP net revenue for the full year, mainly due to a naturally lower ratio of new user to existing user, longer replacement cycle, and geographic mix. In some geographies, w still sell a substantial amount of the lower price original IQOS 2.4+ device and we have now introduced lil SOLID in Eastern Europe.

Focusing now on our total international market share. Our volume share increased by 0.2 points before the impact of duty-free cigarettes and Indonesia. This was driven by higher share for heated tobacco units which increased by 0.8 points to reach 3% only partly offset by lower share for cigarettes. In key markets where IQOS has a meaningful presence, our share increased with very few exceptions. However, our total international market share was negatively impacted by duty-Free and Indonesia.

Marlboro remains by far the world's leading brand with 9.5% share of cigarettes in 2020. However, in many market it over-indexes to social consumption occasion which are naturally lower during COVID-related restriction. Indeed, we saw aggregate Marlboro share movement track pandemic development over the course of the year and expect its recovery to have a similar trend.

In terms of value share, i.e. our share of total industry net revenue excluding the US and China, which is more closely related to financial performance, we estimate to be significantly above our volume share given the premium positioning of Marlboro and IQOS. We expect our value share to grow strongly in 2021 driven by IQOS.

I turn now to Indonesia. After a difficult 2020, we enter 2021 with the sequentially stable share trend, supported by our leadership of the hand-rolled Kretek segment which is growing again. New excise duty rates will come into force on February 1, with a weighted average increase of around 13% for our portfolio over 2021. This is broadly in line with the average annual increase prior to 2020. And for PMI is the lower average increase in the industry given our over indexing to hand-rolled Krete where excise rates are unchanged.

Given this higher margin segments, which support significant employment in Indonesia is both lower price and less tags and machine-made product. We expect a tailwind for our market share and financial performance over the coming year. Despite the negative consequences for governance revenue, there has not yet been a significant move to level the playing field between the tier one and below tier one segments. We remain hopeful that the government will address this issue over time.

With respect to the minimum retail selling price enforcement continue to progress slowly given mobility constraint. However, we expect the impact on the market is no likely to be more limited. The large majority of the industry is no[ph] above minimum level and with no change in the minimum price in 2021 the pattern of new excise rate would move the remainder of the industry above compliance levels.

We also saw a flattening in the growth of the below-tier one segment in the fourth quarter and a gradual improvement in our shipment volume. As in many other market, daily consumption improved since Q2, but it's still below pre-pandemic level and remain sensitive to social restrictions. Indonesia was a material drag on our 2020 financial results, while there remains much work to be done on the excise structure and ongoing uncertainty with regard to the pandemic. For 2021, we expect a much less negative industry volume trend, a better market share outlook, and a much smaller impact on our overall performance.

For the total international cigarette category, we assume a rebound over 2021, 2022 as the negative impact of COVID on daily consumption reverse. The fundamental of the category also remain intact, including price elasticity, which we estimate at around minus 0.4 on the global average basis.

With regard to our combustible portfolio, investment levels remain adequate however, incrementally more may be needed in the immediate aftermath of COVID. We will continue investing in the brand equity of Marlboro, which remains by far the world's leading brand.

Given the economic environment, the management of price gaps and growing our share of the low-price segment will also be a focus. Pricing in combustibles remain an important driver of performance. And while the carryover effect of COVID may impact our 2021 volumes, the pricing power of our portfolio remains strong. Additionally, as HTU volumes grow, this pricing power increases due to the higher price productivity on its and our other HTU brands.

I would also highlight that pricing is no longer the sole driver of our top-line growth with the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix generating significant growth in our average selling price.

I move now to IQOs performance. We estimate that there were 17.6 million legal age IQOS user as of December, 31. This represents the addition of around 1.2 million adult users since the end of the third quarter and over 4 million in 2020. We have notably seen user acquisition accelerate through the second half of the year despite renewed pandemic linked restriction in the fourth quarter in a number of markets.

Our accelerated pivot to digital and remote engagement, combined with the strong momentum for the IQOS brand is paying off. We further estimate that 72% of this total or 12.7 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking with the balance in various stages of conversion. This again reflect widespread user growth momentum across all IQOS' geographies, including the EU region, Japan and Russia.

As our user base expands in markets such as Japan and Russia, we are increasingly enriching our offer and segmenting the category with new product and more price points. The addition of lil SOLID in Russia and Ukraine in the second half helped us to reach a broader range of legal age smokers in these market and bring them into the smoke-free category. Though at this early stage, the number of user acquired through the purchase of a lil device is immaterial in the context of our user base.

As we have said previously, we plan to bring more exciting innovation from IQOS in the coming quarters, which will elaborate on further next week. In the EU region, fourth-quarter share for HEETS reached a record 5% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. As shown on the slide, this reflects strong sequential and year on -- year-over-year growth in IMS volumes.

I draw your attention to the contrast between the consistent sequential growth in IMS and the progression in sequential quarterly share which can be distorted by the seasonality of the combustible market, in addition to other situation linked to the pandemic such as border closure and other social restriction. It follows that 2021 and future years are also likely to see underlying share gain accentuate[ph] in the winter months with the convert dynamic in Q2 and Q4.

This excellent performance reflect strong growth in Italy exiting the year with 10% share with the large majority of user acquisition coming organically as the increasing awareness and prominence of the product to build its own momentum. Germany and Poland were also strong contributors. We added a further 0.6 million IQOS user in the fourth quarter to reach 5.2 million, a continuation of recent strong performance.

In addition, we saw further progress in Spain and in the UK, where both national and London HEETS offtake shares continued to grow with the latter reaching almost 4% in the quarter. We show year select key cities which demonstrate the strong traction of IQOS and the excellent potential for national share across the region. I also refer you to the appendix where we show shares for key EU market and globally key cities.

Strong performance continued in Russia with our HTU share up by 2.2 points to reach a record 7.2% in Q4. As with the EU region, we highlight the effect of the seasonality in the combustible category on quarterly shares. The seasonal fluctuation in Russia can be significant and we urge you to build this in mind when reading our quarterly results in the future. A notable success in the latter part of the year was the expansion of our product portfolio with lil SOLID and Fiit consumable to cater to a broader range of adult smokers across the socio-economic spectrum.

In both Russia and Ukraine, the majority of consumer purchasing a lil device are new user with the incrementality contributing to an acceleration in user acquisition with high level of conversion in line with IQOS. The volume of Fiit consumable sold is broadly commensurate with lil device ownership. And at this early stage of commercialization, both are small in the context of the IQOS' business in this market.

However, while we have successfully upgraded many legal smoker in the medium-price segment to IQOS, this bodes well for our ability to reach consumer in certain market in the medium and below-price segment for whom purchasing power may be a barrier to entering the category. The IQOS brand also resonates strongly across the Eastern Europe region. Rapid growth and excellent market share are testaments to our agile commercial model and the consumer appetite for smoke-free alternatives, even in markets with lower purchasing power. And again serve as very encouraging indicators for the continued progression of our national market share.

In Japan, our total reported share for heated-tobacco units reached 22.1% in the fourth quarter, supported by line extension for both Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS, such as the recent launch of Marlboro Black Menthol. On a more representative total tobacco basis including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movement, the share for our HTU brands increased by 2.9 points versus the prior-year quarter and by 1.2 points sequentially to 20%. Both HEETS and Marlboro HeatSticks grew market share following the October price increase, highlighting the strength of our price tiered[ph] portfolio. We are especially pleased by our Q4 offtake share in Tokyo which reached the milestone of 25% in December.

Q4 2020 adjusted in-market sales volume for our HTU brands grew 0.6% sequentially, which we regard as a strong performance given the pull forward of consumer offtake into Q3 before the price increase. The overall heated-tobacco category made up over 27% of the total tobacco market in Q4 with IQOS maintaining its high share of segment. We are especially pleased by our Q4 offtake share in Tokyo, which reached the milestone of 25% in December. A very similar picture is seen in (inaudible) across Japan including Sendai. The current market has specific challenges around consumer misperception of the category. And while we continue working to address this issue, it's notable that Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia has already overtaken Seoul in market share terms crossing double-digit in the third quarter. In addition to strong growth in existing markets, the geographic expansion of IQOS continues. We leverage our digital capability to launch in three new market Estonia, Kuwait, and the Maldives. This takes the total number of markets where IQOS is available for sale to 64 of which over half are outside the OECD.

We continued the commercialization of IQOS VEEV our new e-vapor product with the first EU market launch in the Czech Republic in December. This follows lead market New Zealand in August 2020 and we will continue to enter new market over 2021, including Italy and Finland in the coming weeks.

As we have said previously, the commercial infrastructure of IQOS loses to deploy efficiently and at scale. Both the VEEV device and the consumable will be premium position. We also place great importance on an effort to grow[ph] against huge success for all our product. As we rollout IQOS VEEV, we will be testing age verification technology in select markets.

Switching now to sustainability, I want to again emphasize that our corporate strategy and our sustainability strategy are deeply aligned. ESG issues are business issues that serve as input to our long-term strategy and sit at the core of our mission. Despite the unprecedented challenges of the global pandemic, we have not deviated from our efforts to be a more sustainable company and we achieved a number of key milestone in 2020.

By replacing cigarettes with less harmful alternative, we can significantly reduce the negative impact of our product have on the health of our consumers. That's why the core of our strategy focuses on addressing the impact of P, product, the first and most critical pillar of our approach to sustainability. This is what differentiates our company and highlight our unique value proposition as the final piece of our ESG plus P framework.

Phasing out cigarettes remain our focus. And in 2020, we estimate a further 4.1 million legal late smokers enter the smoke-free category with IQOS with a total of 12.7 million now switched and stopped smoking. We also show here some recent notable achievements across ESG which we'll come back to in more detail at Investor Day.

While there remains much work to do, we believe our transparency and detailed approach to sustainability, materiality and disclosure make PMI an excellent example of impact which we are achieving through carefully embedding system ability into business and understanding it as an opportunity for innovation and growth. Including our pioneering role in tobacco on[ph] reduction. In other words, our transformation is a unique sustainability story. Another topic, we will return to next week.

I will now turn to guidance for 2021, where we expect a significant recovery. The main unknown is the speed and shape of the global exits from the pandemic. While COVID was clearly disruptive to our performance in 2020, it is not yet over and we must factor this uncertainty into our outlook for the coming year. With the rollout of vaccines just starting and lockdown measures currently in place across many markets, we do not assume any meaningful change in the first quarter where we also face an unfavorable pre-COVID prior-year comparison.

Looking beyond this, there are clearly a range of outcome, and we are reflecting these by providing a range for our assumed organic growth in net revenue and EPS. These ranges assume that even in the event of prolonged restriction we will not see a return to the depressed consumption level of Q2 2020 which is consistent with our observation of less severe impact in the second wave. For Duty-Free, a rebound in global travel is likely to lag the improvement of in-country mobility. Our guidance assumes no meaningful recovery in Duty-Free this year.

Despite this assumption, we expect organic net revenue growth in the range of 4% to 7% and organic adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 9% to plus 11% or plus 14% to plus 16% in dollar terms. This tighter range for EPS reflects the likely higher level of gross investment in the event of a faster recovery and thus our assumption is for at least 150 basis points of margin expansion in all scenarios within the range. This reflects the ongoing positive mix effect of IQOS in our business and the accretion of cost efficiency, net of continued growth investment.

This projected organic EPS growth including an estimated[ph] favorable currency impact of approximately $0.25 at prevailing rates translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $5.80 to $6. This guidance does not assume share repurchases. This is guidance also assumes the achievement of our three-year HTU shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units.

Coming to some of the other key assumptions underpinning this guidance. We expect a total industry volume progression of flat to minus 3% depending on the speed and shape of recovery from the pandemic. We expect to outperform the industry trend driven by the share gains of IQOS with the resulting PMI volume forecast of plus 1% to minus 2%. This also incorporates a manageable excise outlook including a positive structural change in Turkey, an above-average increase in Russia, and the increase in Indonesia in line with historic averages.

As I mentioned earlier, our combustible pricing power remains strong. However, given 2020 carryover effect, notably in Indonesia and the immediate aftermath of the COVID crisis, we assume convertible pricing of 2% to 3% in 2021 or around plus 4% excluding Indonesia. As in 2020, the biggest driver for our top-line growth is likely to be the higher weight of the IQOS business which has significantly higher average net revenue per unit.

As laid out in this morning's press release, we assume that our full-year effective tax rate will be around 22% and assume that operating cash flow will grow strongly to around $11 billion at prevailing exchange rate and subject to capital -- to working capital requirement. As I already mentioned, we assume capital expenditure of around $0.8 billion.

Let me now spend a moment on the expectation for the first quarter. Our organic net revenue are likely to be around stable to slightly down as we lap a strong Q1 2020 which benefited from inventory buildup in March as the pandemic began to spread in many markets, in addition to being a largely COVID-free quarter. This incorporates continued strong year-on-year growth in the shipment and IMS volumes of HTUs.

Due to normal seasonal patterns and the lower number of selling days in Q1, we expect this volume to be sequentially stable to slightly below Q4 2020. We also expect strong sequential HTU share gains on both an underlying and reported basis compared to Q4, noting the seasonal factor in the combustible market I already mentioned.

We expect strong margin progression in Q1, primarily due to the positive mix effect of IQOS and the effect of the cost efficiency realized in 2020. We believe this would result in an organic adjusted diluted EPS growth of around 8%, which equates to around $1.40 including an estimated $0.09 favorable currency impact at prevailing rates.

Looking beyond the first quarter, it will come as no surprise that the easier comparison in Q2 should enable higher than average year-over-year growth in volumes and net revenues.

To conclude, our result was stronger than expected with plus 7% organic EPS growth delivered in the (inaudible) of 2020. We are building a business through IQOS to deliver superior and sustainable growth over the coming years. Continued momentum of IQOS through the challenges of the pandemic demonstrates this structural growth characteristic. We are also committed to maintaining the strong leadership and competitiveness of our combustible business.

We have a number of levers for growth in our top and bottom line. First, the powerful mix effect of IQOS. Second pricing, which remains important for combustible and where appropriate, for RRPs. Additionally, efficiency in our manufacturing, supply chain, and SG&A cost are further levers as we continue to hone our business model.

Moreover, with the launches of the IQOS VEEV and lil product, we are broadening and stepping up our product offer and innovation in 2021. You can also expect us to bring further exciting innovation to our IQOS heat-not-burn platform.

As I mentioned, sustainability is at the heart of our smoke-free strategy and we continue to work tirelessly to further our mission. Our organization demonstrated extraordinary resilience in 2020, coping and growing admirably through one of the most challenging period in recent history. At the same time, our business continue to transform incorporating and leveraging new skills and capabilities.

In short, we look forward with confidence and we will expand on this topic further at our Investor Day on February 10. We look forward to seeing you there.

Thank you. Andre, Jacek, and I are now more than happy to answer your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. We will now conduct the question and answer portion of the conference. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Bonnie Herzog{BIO 1840179 <GO>}
Hi, everyone.

A - Andre Calantzopoulos{BIO 5266979 <GO>}
Hi, Bonnie.

A - Emmanuel Babeau{BIO 4114796 <GO>}
Hello, Bonnie.

Q - Bonnie Herzog{BIO 1840179 <GO>}
Hi. And congratulations on Andre and Jacek. I guess my first question today would be on margins. And I guess Emmanuel, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your expectations around margins, I guess in terms of any favorable fixed cost absorption you expect as you amortize the investment behind IQOS over this increasingly larger accelerating volume base.

And then as I am thinking about that in the context of your variable cost going lower as you touched upon, thinking about the progress you've made with digital. So could you just talk about that? And how big of an impact this could be or big of an opportunity this could be in the future? Thanks.

Sure. Bonnie. Happy to do that. It's going to be only a teaser versus what we're going to say next week. So bear with us and we'll elaborate with much more detail. But I can certainly anticipate a few headline on what we'll share next week.

I think what is obvious in our number for 2020 is the fact that, beyond the great performance of IQOS, we have also used efficiency on cost as a powerful lever to generate performance. That's really showing up very clearly in our numbers. So we are delivering in two years, instead of three years the overall at least $1 billion savings.

And what is good is that we are working on cost efficiency on civil levels and many of them of course, are related to IQOS, but not exclusively to IQOS for some of them. If you look at the gross margin level, it's quite obvious that we are being very successful in generating, manufacturing, productivity. And that's a great driver for further margin improvement. And here we are working globally across the portfolio I would say on margin improvement. So it's not just on IQOS even if probably on IQOS because that's a business that doesn't have the same maturity. We have more runway if you want to improve the productivity and we are certainly making extremely good inroad in that respect, that[ph] we are also generating manufacturing productivity on CC[ph].

And then on our SG&A, I think you could identify two driver on cost efficiency. One, I would say is probably something you're going to find in many company today. We are working to be a more efficient and agile company so we work on being more digitized, we work on simplifying the way we work, we automate, we standardize and that is allowing us not to be a cost cutter but just to take you know, cost to be a better company and deliver overall higher performance.

And then you have elements that are indeed connected with our commercial performance and not only to IQOS but certainly, mainly to IQOS. And you have two elements. One is all the investment that we made in the past and that you know is a great platform on IQOS. And I am not saying that investment is over. We are going to keep investing but of course, we have now an investment that we amortize over a fast-growing base. And we are not growing the level of investment at the speed of the growth of the IQOS business.

And then there is this great work that we are doing. Thanks to digital and thanks of course to all the learning that we are making on the IQOS business, where we very nicely reduce all the variable per user cost. But I will stop there because we will elaborate on that next week.

Q - Bonnie Herzog{BIO 1840179 <GO>}
Okay. That was really helpful. I appreciate that. And then my second question is, all the progress you've made with IQOS in growing the base and it's so large, but as you look out could you talk about further segmentation of markets with your different platforms or possibly different price points as you continue to convert more smokers? I mean you touched on that. My guess is you're going to touch on that more next week. But just as I looked at your business, it implies that your user base is probably going to need to double in the next maybe three-plus years based on our analysis for you to hit your aspirational target of that 250 billion units by 2025. So love to hear any strategy there, insights, because I think about it I assume more of the conversion is going to come from other reduced risk technologies and how do you anticipate your mix evolving over time? Thanks.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Yeah. I'll give you the first shot. I still believe over the next three years, Bonnie, as I said many times that heated-tobacco technology would be the prevailing technology because it has the highest ability in terms of taste and satisfaction to convert people. Now in terms of segmentation, I believe, in most markets, we will need one or two heat-not-burn technologies, if I stay with this segment. And probably two to three over time consumable price segments, so we can cover mostly the vast majority of the market. There will be exclusions where you need to cover four[ph] price segments with probably two technologies. And we'll talk next week about the next step in technology for (inaudible) in heat-not-burn which will address many of the pain points consumers have today.

Now clearly the heated-tobacco product is one category, I think that has the fastest growth both in terms of revenue and bottom line and volume. The second is obviously e-vapor. We are entering this market because I believe there is consumers there that want to switch straight to this product. There is a lot of dual users. And we see also dual users between heat-not-burn and e-vapor that obviously we would like to capture. I think we can also capture consumers for our e-vapor products. The key there is clearly to leverage the infrastructure and the brand name from IQOS. I think the product is very good and that's the first reaction we get. But we need to build equity, because that's a problem for the category as you know, and also consumer loyalty. Because for the economics to be at best for e-vapor you don't only need to be premium position but you also need to have loyal consumers. Because if you discount just products and you sell them, and then a consumer has 10 different products from 10 different competitors and consumers have a cartridge of your product per week is very difficult to make return, and more importantly, is very difficult to maintain an infrastructure.

Now we have the advantage of having a lot of infrastructure with IQOS that we can leverage, the equity of IQOS is undeniably the best in the RRP. So I think that's helpful. Technology is good. We are premium so I think we can make inroads in this category. And then obviously, we were also going to expand in the pure nicotine products like nicotine pouches or the P3 over time, although I think this is more occasional use products rather than predominant use products.

So that's a little bit. And again, sorry to cut this here, but we are going to elaborate this more -- in more extensively next week. Okay?

Q - Bonnie Herzog{BIO 1840179 <GO>}
I expected that. So, very helpful. Thank you so much.

A - Emmanuel Babeau{BIO 4114796 <GO>}

The next question will come from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.

Q - Michael Lavery{BIO 20141239 <GO>}
Good morning. Thank you. Just wanted to touch on IQOS again. And the Philippines you have a 20 basis points share which is of course is small, but it's very early there. And if I understand it right, you launched there without any stores initially. You also touched on the call about some digital launches in Estonia and Kuwait and the Maldives and so, just would love a little more sense of how some of those digital efforts work. And certainly, seen[ph] the Philippines are ready to be pretty quickly effective. Can you just bring to life a little bit of how you're going to market there?

Q - Unidentified Participant
Yeah. (inaudible). So as we started this year in Philippines, to be very precise in the Manila, not of even in the Greater Manila and the product As expected, actually responded to pretty well. This was one of the first fully digital if I may launch, also driven by the fact that we had to change the strategy last moment due to the COVID restrictions and the whole COVID impact. And the product starts getting good tractions. I think we'll still stay for a while in the Manila which is frankly speaking not the major secret because we are following the same path, the same strategy for the rollout in every geography, right. And especially, if you go to the sizable geography like Philippines.

(inaudible) our product is well received for (inaudible) taste characteristics et cetera feeds very well. We are also testing the different route to consumer models as you know we entering the countries when you have a stick purchase, there was a lot of consumption on trade rather than just soft trade. So we need to come up with a good solution. But I am very positive on that part of Asia which is still uncharted for IQOs.

Q - Michael Lavery{BIO 20141239 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you that's helpful. And just a second one on buybacks, helpful clarity that there is no consideration of that in the guidance. But with some currency tailwinds now and the balance sheet where it is, it certainly seems like that could be -- could come into play. Can you give a sense of what you would need to have in place or see before you might trigger resuming of buyback?

Q - Unidentified Participant
Look, if you bear with us until next week, we'll have a global review of our capital allocation strategy and will address all components at that stage.

Q - Michael Lavery{BIO 20141239 <GO>}
Okay, that's -- no problem. if I could just maybe swap that question then. Could you give any sense of where you stand on 2[ph] with TEEPS? Any update on that?

Q - Unidentified Participant
On TEEPS, so the platform 2. I mean, we will be further conducting this time the market commercial past this year, in 2021.

The next question will come from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen.

Q - Vivien Azer{BIO 16513330 <GO>}
Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to also drill down on IQOS. I was wondering if you could give us some color on what the mix looks like for the consumables from traditional tobacco flavors and some of the novel flavors that you have in the market? Thanks.

A - Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
That's -- Jacek here. Hi, Vivien. It varies market by market, okay? Obviously, as you know, we have flavors of menthol, we have some other flavors, but still (inaudible) frankly speaking, in most of the places is very much attractiveness is coming from tobacco flavors. I mean at the end of the day most of the segments which we are targeting at this stage, and we are operating at scale, I mean, in most of the segments are the flavor -- tobacco flavor type of the segments, rights. And IQOS really has a very winning proposition, there that also has great propositions in menthol and other flavors.

So that varies by the country and I know you can't really -- I think if I give you the international share of the flavor, that will just misleading, the average doesn't(Multiple Speakers)

Q - Unidentified Participant
But it follows typically if you have a predominant menthol market like Japan, the predominance of menthol, if you are predominantly -- I mean cigarettes markets without menthol then you are predominantly there. A bit sometimes over-indexed in menthol in general, because it's -- it has a bit more impact for people, so it's easier to switch.

Q - Vivien Azer{BIO 16513330 <GO>}
Understood. Thank you for that. And my follow-up also on IQOS, please. In terms of the market share progression that you saw in Japan, either in the quarter, over the course of the year, can you contextualize the contributions from the Marlboro brand versus the HEETS brand? Thank you.

Q - Unidentified Participant
The Marlboro brand is still the major contributor of the overall volumes and the growth. So you know we are very pleased that on the course of the last year we continued growing Marlboro, obviously, HEETS which is priced a notch below the Marlboro had to be the better dynamics than Marlboro but above -- actually contributing to the growth.

And it's very interesting, Vivien you're asking because this is the first market which we try the dual or double -- dual positioning of the consumables, Marlboro (inaudible), Japan. As you know very well, we also extend HEETS in the couple of Eastern European geographies in Russia, when first brought the above premium propositions to HEETS, the HEETS Creations. And you know HEETS Creations contributed (inaudible) like premium raise[ph] further seeds in Russia and I think fluctuations in Moscow constitute now about 10% of the overall HEETS volume. So that's very good.

And then we complimented on the notch below price segments by bringing the lil, Fiit proposition. So we -- now in Russia we're testing can IQOS operate on the free essentially price segments on the devices. And the spread is pretty phenomenal, because IQOS devices will go from $60 on the premium device and then we go down to the $20 on the lil device, and then we have a coverage on the consumable spreading from a RUB170 per (inaudible). So it gives you the hint how broadly we now -- we can grow with IQOS touching the segments above medium and below medium.

And this is despite as you know that we have a competition in Russia, but frankly speaking competition in terms of the devices is essentially close to zero. So it's a little bit of a very aggressive promotions. But we continue delivering the strong growth from -- on IQOS both in terms of the user acquisitions measured by the device sales and by the HEETS' further expansions on the heat[ph].

And what is also good in a place like in Russia, that we continue growing in the top cities which we started few years ago. So we have a continuous growth in the cities and the expansion doesn't need from that growth which we have in the Moscow, St. Petersburg and the other main cities.

Q - Vivien Azer{BIO 16513330 <GO>}
Thank you so much for that color. I appreciate it.

The next question will come from the line of Gaurav Jain with Barclays.

Q - Gaurav Jain{BIO 20455166 <GO>}
Yeah. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Sir, on the organic margin improvement which you are guiding to FY21 of 150 basis point, that is on top of 240 basis point improvement in FY20. And this saw benefits like reduction in travel expenses, there was a cut in German VAT et cetera. So what I am trying to ask is that is your underlying margin improvement closer to 200 basis point, not 150 basis point? And that is clearly happening because of high cost. So is that how we should be thinking about the next few years as well?

Q - Unidentified Participant
So for the medium term again we'll elaborate next week on more outlook. For the year, Gaurav, I'll let you make your assumption. I think we are clear on the kind of one-off saving that we have seen because of the COVID, so you can factor that in your model. And then I think we're also clear on what are the driver for margin improvement. So it's about the positive impact of IQOS, in term of per stick revenue, in term of margin and then you know everything that is happening on cost efficiency, that is really what is driving -- that has been driving the margin improvement in 2020 and that will continue in 2021 as you can imagine beyond 2021, but we'll elaborate on that next week.

Q - Gaurav Jain{BIO 20455166 <GO>}
Sure. My second question is on the European Beating Cancer plan, which was released earlier this week. And the talk of things like flavor ban, plain packaging, increasing taxes on heated tobacco to equal to cigarettes. So how do you think of that and how do you incorporate these sort of risks and your outlook?

Q - Unidentified Participant
Okay. First of all, this is a plan and there are many positive aspects also in this plan, in my view. First of all, we don't talk about taxes. I mean this is subject to two directives. The tobacco excise directive, that governs the excise tax, and the tobacco product directive, that is the regulation of the product, okay. The first is the tobacco excise directive today does not foresee reduced risk product categories. So it has to be amended under all circumstances okay. And we're not talking about increases, it's creating a framework and which member states can tax.

Our view is that absence of combustion for example is a key criteria on how to tax differently cigarettes to other products. And then within that major clif of change in toxicity and exposure member states can have different tax rates for these products. But this product should not be by any means higher than any combustible category available okay, as a minimum criteria. But this has to happen. Nobody said that taxes will increase on heated tobacco products, frankly, speaking at this stage or in e-vapor products, okay. So all this has to be defined and the discussions are going to start in the course of this year and continue in next year in any case.

So that's for -- and then the tobacco product directive in serve[ph], I hope that there will be a bit more regulatory clarity in there regarding RRPs, because any e-vapor products, because just now we left it up to the member states to regulate which frankly speaking is not harmonizing the directive, one. And secondly, is a pain for the industry participants, because every country has a different regulation. And we've always advocated serious regulation on these products, provided that this is differentiated from cigarettes okay.

Now there are voices that say that these products will be the same thing as cigarettes, but at the end of the day it was very clear also in the cancer plan that all in the Q&A that only based on science and evidence they will take decisions. So I wouldn't be particularly worried about this at this stage. And I think the outcome may be positive actually because it's an opportunity to discuss all these things.

Now, in the longer term we discussed very often, I believe tax differentials will be maintained because it makes sense for public health, it makes sense for the consumers, and as I -- we also explained, we have room even to pass taxes if by any chance differentials close somehow, because IQOS (inaudible) in order to pass past of the tax benefit to the consumers it's mid-priced position essentially, if you take the weighted average of the countries, number one.

And number two, its price productivity is much, much higher than cigarettes so passing on a tax is triggering less price increase than passing on tax of cigarettes. So that's in a nutshell, the way we should look at it. But we have to assume that excise taxes will increase over time also for RRPs as government need money, and that will apply to heated tobacco products that already taxed substantially and potentially in some cases to e-vapor products in the future. But that's all baked in the assumptions.

Q - Gaurav Jain{BIO 20455166 <GO>}
Sure. Thanks and if I can ask one last question. It's on your minority interest, which has been increasing at a higher rate than your EBIT and that's driven by Philippines. So is there an opportunity to reduce your minority interests considering your partner in Philippines trades on the exchanges had like some 6 times PE?

The next question will come from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.

Q - Adam Spielman{BIO 1883727 <GO>}
Hello. (inaudible) The first question, I think you said in your guidance that you are expecting to take less pricing variance on combustible cigarettes than usual. Now -- for years and years and years it's been 6%. And I think you said it's something to do with (inaudible) that you want to take that pricing. I am really surprised by that. You also said the pricing model hasn't been broken. So I suppose the question is, if you take less pricing in combustibles this year, 2021 what would it take for you to have another low year in 2022? That would be my first question.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Okay. First of all, we didn't say we will take less pricing. We will also --[ph] this pricing opportunity will take price and I think the model still works very well, at last, it is all the same, everything. We had to make some, in my view, reasonable conservative, you may say assumptions regarding what's going to happen in Indonesia and Russia, because of the tax increase. And Indonesia has never gotten[ph] carry over from last year which makes the comparisons year-to-year problematic okay.

Plus in Germany, we had a VAT, I would say tax break, which we assume is not going to continue this year. So if you exclude all these elements I think we're still back to a normal pricing in the other markets. So clearly in terms of post-COVID I would say assumptions, we have to watch more carefully the price gaps; that's clear at the mid-to-low end of the market. But that doesn't mean that we're going to take any severe pricing decisions at this stage anywhere. I just -- this is a watch out. If there is down-trading, which is happening between the mid-price typically and the low-price segment also because we have absence of contraband and all these things. That's something to watch on in certain markets, but overall I think we're in good shape.

Also, you know, both on IQOS on heat-not-burn products and combustible, the excise taxes are now in, if I am not mistaken everywhere. So we have pretty good visibility of where we are, okay. So I don't think it's super COVID-related. What is COVID-related in the guidance is the range we gave, because if you look at what happened last year. If we assume 2% to 3% underlying industry decline even baking in Indonesia we had a 6.7% industry decline so we're missing consumption for mathematically 3.7 to 4.7. That's on average $100 billion for the industry. So we don't -- that will rebound in my view one day, but once the restrictions finish.

Now we gave a guidance for this year of 0 to minus 3, which is at zero you have some recovery, at minus 3 you have super underlying negativity may be exaggerated, I don't know at this stage, but that's plus-minus 20 billion units for us. So that's plus-minus 2.5 revenue points. So that's where the volatility is okay. And if pricing comes better in Russia and Indonesia that much the better. We may end up at the high end of the range.

Q - Adam Spielman{BIO 1883727 <GO>}
Okay. Well, I think that leads my next question which is to be blunt, I don't really understand the EPS guidance. And there are many aspects to really understand about it. So first of all, you're saying in Q1 where your comp is insanely hard, you're going to have flat organic sales, you're going to have margin expansion, you're going to have 8% like-for-like EPS growth.

You then say because the comp is really easy in Q2, you're going to have a great quarter or you imply that. And yet the full year is only 9 to 11, and it seems to me that if you can do so well in Q1 and you are going to do well in Q2, then the 9 to 11 is very conservative.

And another way of asking the same question, every single time you've given guidance of any sort on EPS since 2018 (inaudible). This is -- this quarter you gave guidance, it wasn't a range, it was a point estimate. You said you were going to be about $1.20 for the fourth quarter. And you said that in December, and yet you beat it very handsomely. Now, that would suggest that the way you give guidance is systematically incredibly conservative. Either you can't forecast, which I don't believe or you are systematically incredibly conservative, that point that we've always been conservative with the fact, we fair well in Q1 against a really tough comp suggesting me that the guidance for the full year, It also super conservative. Is that fair?

A - Andre Calantzopoulos{BIO 5266979 <GO>}
I wouldn't say conservative, but it's not bullish either. Okay. I mean, I understand what you are saying. But we're at the beginning of the year, okay? Many things going to happen regarding COVID because it is not finished. So last year as Emmanuel said, we had more than $150 million exceptional expenses because of COVID, okay. So you need to put some caution in the bottom line regarding unexpected costs. And if we have a rebound, I would call, not very gradual recovery, we may need to invest a bit more money towards the end of the year to accelerate acquisition, you can physically do that. If we physically can't, then clearly the money will go to the bottom line.

So at this stage, we gave this range, okay, which by the way if the dollar stays with disease is not bad at all because it's 14% to 16% and the revenue line would be 8% to 11%, which will be phenomenal, I would say. So I don't think this is conservative. It's just, I don't have a crystal ball to foresee everything that's happening in every month of this year, okay. We're still not in normal situation. That's all.

Q - Adam Spielman{BIO 1883727 <GO>}
So I understand nut -- just how i want to explain. just in the sequence, please factoring that I mean, as we say, we took about a gradual recovery that we are expecting without being able to of course these exactly what can be the trajectory, but that would mean certainly more investment in H2. Remember you know, we've been of course limited in commercial activity.

As you know we say H2 could be a better moment overall with a number of restriction being eased, there will be also more investments, Q2 was the second part of the year. So you have to take that into account and that explained as well you know why Q1 may be is expected today a better than one could have expected initially, but the investment we need to happen in the year. I think it's, I would love to be conservative and as the quarters unfold. We'll get more. Okay.

Q - Unidentified Participant
But I think I gave the parameters the pricing -- but still can come more favorable that goes straight to the bottom line. If you have -- it more combustible that's fine, it goes to the bottom line, but we have to assume that. So as the quarters pass, we'll give you better idea.
