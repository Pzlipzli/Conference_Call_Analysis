Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
Thank you, James, and welcome, everyone.

PMI delivered another strong operating performance in 2023. We achieved our third consecutive year of positive volumes and a high single-digit organic top-line growth, driven by smoke-free products. Smoke-free products delivered accelerated accretion to profitability in the fourth quarter as our IQOS business delivered meaningful 2023 operating leverage, mitigating a significant drag from combustibles. I'm also very pleased to report the continued outstanding growth of ZYN, which was not included in organic metrics until mid of November last year. Importantly, smoke-free products reached nearly 40% of total PMI net revenues in the fourth quarter and over 40% of gross profit. For the year, smoke-free gross profit increased by 19% organically, and we expect smoke-free organic growth to accelerate for both net revenues and gross profit in 2024.

ZYN delivered exceptional growth in its first year within PMI, with U.S. pro forma volumes up by over 60% for the year and over 75% in the quarter four. Oral smoke-free is accretive to both our smoke-free business and the overall growth, with Swedish Match contributing 50 basis points organic uplift to Q4 OI margins from only 50 days of the period. Our IQOS business continues to deliver excellent results, with 15% adjusted in-market sales growth for Heated Tobacco Units, reflecting broad-based momentum in Europe, Japan, and emerging markets. The roll-out of IQOS ILUMA is substantially complete and now present -- is present in the 51 markets, representing over 95% of IQOS geographies by volume, excluding Russia and Ukraine.

The superior experience and design of ILUMA, combined with the strong premium brand wide equity of IQOS and our commercial infrastructure, enabled IQOS to outgrow the heat-not-burn category, despite holding a category share of over 75%. Importantly, as we have seen in Japan, the launch of ILUMA is a multi-year growth driver, consistent with past IQOS innovation. Our 2023 combustible performance was margin dilutive despite strong commercial results, with very good pricing and higher category share. This reflects the significant cost pressures in the category, geographic mix from volume growth in lower margin market without smoke-free products, and the impact of IQOS cannibalization.

This was also compounded by the technical impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia and Ukraine. While cost and currency headwinds impacted our earnings in 2023, the strengthening growth and margin profile of smoke-free products set us up well to deliver sustainable growth and returns, including currency, in 2024 and beyond. We reached a number of key transformation milestones in the last quarter of last year. First, IQOS net revenues surpassed Marlboro to become the number one international nicotine brand on this measure. This demonstrates the power of innovative smoke-free alternatives to switch adult smokers away from cigarettes and to address the societal issue of combustible tobacco. It is also a testament to our organization's ability to build strong and sustainable brand equity.

This also applies to ZYN, the fastest growing U.S. smoke-free brand with another outstanding performance in Q4, marked by an increase in category volume share, retail value share, and overall volume. We're also proud to have reached 25 markets where smoke-free products exceed 50% of our top-line for both Q4 and the full year. We aim to reach 60 markets by 2030, driving our ambition to exceed two-thirds of group net revenues.

Last, as I already mentioned, over 40% of our total gross profit was generated by smoke-free products, with the adjusted gross margin rate on smoke-free surpassing combustibles for both the quarter and year. We are encouraged by the increasing number of governments adopting tobacco harm reduction policies to encourage reduced-risk nicotine consumption instead of smoking, which is ultimately more sustainable for society.

Nevertheless, a considerable amount of work remains. Sustainable growth requires a sustainable business, and we continue to garner increasing recognition for our sustainability performance across the key product and operational topics for our company. PMI was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time, and for the fourth year in a row, the DJSI North America. In addition, PMI was awarded Carbon Disclosure Project's Triple A rating for the fourth consecutive year.

I will now hand it over to Emmanuel to discuss our results and outlook in more detail.

Emmanuel Babeau{BIO 4114796 <GO>}
Thank you, Jacek.

Let's start with the headline numbers. We finished the year strongly with Q4 organic net revenue growth of plus 8.3%. This includes plus 14% growth from smoke-free products, despite slower HTU shipment growth due to comparison effect, and also plus 5% growth from combustibles. Pricing was a strong driver for both categories, with smoke-free pricing including the impact of retail price increases on HTUs. While Swedish Match was only included in organic metrics as of November the 12th, it contributed plus 0.8 percentage points to Q4 organic top-line growth and grew by an excellent plus 26% on a pro forma basis. Operating income grew organically by a very good plus 8%, including a Swedish Match contribution of plus 2.2 points. As expected, Q4 margins were broadly stable organically and grew, excluding the technical effect mentioned by Jacek.

This enabled our business to deliver another quarter of double-digit currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth at plus 12.2%. This exceeded our prior expectations with ZYN's remarkable growth as a notable contributor. Despite this strong currency-neutral result, Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.36 was adversely affected by a greater than expected currency impact of $0.20. This includes a $0.09 balance-sheet-related impact under hyperinflationary accounting in Argentina, following the devaluation of the peso in mid-December. As with the previously mentioned impact in Q3, this reflects the depreciation of monetary net assets denominated in pesos, which are subject to capital controls. By its nature, this does not carry forward to future periods.

Turning to the full year, net revenue grew by plus 7.8% organically, representing the third straight year of high single-digit growth. Similar to Q4, this reflects continued excellent IQOS momentum and strong combustible pricing. In 2023, Swedish Match, led by ZYN, grew pro forma ex-currency net revenues by plus 20%. Operating income grew by plus 3.7% organically, reflecting a challenging first half, followed by strong growth in H2.

We delivered expansion in both adjusted gross margin and operating income margin in H2, driven by the strong progress of smoke-free products. With the impact of accelerated device sales from the ILUMA roll-out in the base and a return to sea freight to Japan, the effect of growing HTU volume and ongoing cost optimization are clearly visible.

As expected, OI margins organically contracted 150 basis points for the full year, primarily due to acute cost and supply chain headwinds in H1. As flagged in prior quarters, full year margins include a 40 basis point headwind from the accounting treatment of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia and Ukraine, primarily reflecting the Indonesia excise tax gross-up of around $250 million growth in both net revenue and cost of sales. While headwinds in combustibles have not fully abated, our smoke-free business is delivering excellent profit growth, and our organic results will include a strong contribution from Swedish Match going forward. We successfully mitigated inflationary pressure and supported investment with efficiency.

Across our total operating cost base, we delivered an incremental $100 million in gross cost efficiencies in Q4 and $2.2 billion for 2021-2023 overall, surpassing our $2 billion target. We target an additional $2 billion over the next three years. These positive factors allowed us to deliver very strong currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 11%, ahead of our prior expectations. Adjusted diluted EPS of $6.01 includes unfavorable currency of $0.63, primarily reflecting the Japanese yen, Russian ruble, and specific Argentine peso dynamics I just explained. We include a slide in the appendix to this presentation with more detail.

Focusing now on volumes, we comfortably achieved a third consecutive year of shipment growth, driven by a plus 15% increase for IQOS HTUs in addition to a resilient combustible performance. Our smoke-free volumes made up over 20% of total PMI in Q4, and with continued mid-teens of better growth expected here, we are very well positioned to continue growing volume over the mid and long-term. 2023 HTU shipment volume of 125.3 billion units were at the lower end of our targeted range due to delayed launches in Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, combined with lower-than-expected underlying growth in Russia and Ukraine. For IQOS HTUs, we believe the best indicator of underlying growth is adjusted IMS, as the closest metric to consumer offtake.

For the full year, adjusted in-market sales volume and shipment growth were in line at plus 15%. In the fourth quarter, HTU shipment growth of plus 6% reflect trade inventory buildup in the prior year quarter and the plus 14% adjusted IMS growth is therefore a more reliable measure of continued strong growth momentum. Excluding Russia and Ukraine, adjusted in-market sales grew by more than plus 17% for the year. For context, across the two years before the war began in 2022, these markets made up 23% of HTU shipment volume and exceeded the company's growth rate by a notable margin. These smoke-free volume growth rates exclude the excellent development of our oral nicotine portfolio, driven by ZYN, with shipment volumes up by plus 23% in Q4 and plus 17% in 2023 on a pro forma basis.

Cigarette shipments declined by a modest 1.4% in 2023, outperforming the international category decline of 2.4%. Turning to profits, organic operating income growth stepped up in H2 to plus 10%, following the exceptional headwind of H1. We believe this is more representative of the underlying momentum of our business and in line with our '24-'26 CAGR target range of plus 8% to plus 10%. Focusing now on some key drivers of our full year operating income, smoke-free gross profit grew organically by an excellent plus 19%, expanding gross margin by 340 basis points. This reflects part of the operating leverage of IQOS I already mentioned, with a notable contribution from Swedish Match oral nicotine in the last 50 days of Q4, with organic operating profit growth of over 50%.

With smoke-free commercial costs also increasing by less than net revenue, this clearly bodes well for 2024, as we continue to benefit from scale effect and manufacturing optimization. Despite very strong pricing, there was only marginal organic growth in combustible gross profit. This partly reflects the negative geographic mix I already mentioned, with greater volume decline in higher margin markets like Japan as adult smokers switch to smoke-free products, and better volume trends in lower margin geographies where smoke-free products are small or not available, such as Turkey. There were also significant inflationary pressures on leaf, direct materials, and other manufacturing costs. Cost increases on leaf, where inventory covers multiple crop years, and wages are likely to carry over into 2024 and should ease thereafter.

Moving now to Swedish Match, which delivered outstanding performance in its first full year as part of PMI, with adjusted pro forma currency-neutral top-line growth of plus 26% in Q4 and plus 20% in 2023. When we announced our offer for Swedish Match in 2022, we targeted a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital within five years. With the growth of ZYN surpassing our expectation, we now expect to achieve this well ahead of time. ZYN delivered another remarkable U.S. performance with plus 78% volume growth in Q4 and plus 62% in 2023. Internationally, we have launched or relaunched ZYN in 10 markets as planned, as we continue to focus on building a truly global brand. U.S. cigars posted robust 2023 results, growing net revenues and profits.

This was driven by strong pricing following an increase in April, partially offset by volume decline which reflect lagged competitor pricing and comparison effects. ZYN's excellent U.S. progress continued in Q4 with plus 15% sequential growth in 12 months rolling shipments. Impressively, category volume share grew for the third consecutive quarter to 72.8%, an increase of plus 5.4 points year-on-year and plus 2 points sequentially. Retail value share also grew during the quarter to 77.4%, highlighting VEEV's premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth again reflects a broad step-up in nationwide store velocities and gradual distribution expansion as the category gained strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience.

Now focusing on IQOS, starting with user growth. We estimate there were 28.6 million IQOS users as of December 31, representing growth of 1.2 million users in the quarter and plus 3.7 million for the full year, a nice acceleration compared to 2022. This includes notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. ILUMA is now available in essentially all major markets outside Russia and Ukraine, with over 17 million estimated adult users as of December 31, 2023. This reflects the switching of existing IQOS users and the acquisition of adult smokers. We expect ILUMA to drive continued strong IQOS user growth in 2024 and beyond. Considering the seasonal fluctuation and volatility in quarterly user estimation, we plan to report this metric on a semi-annual basis going forward.

With the addition of ZYN to our portfolio and the smaller but growing VEEV e-vapor business, we also intend to provide a more holistic view of our total smoke-free user base to investors. Moving now to IQOS in the Europe region, where smoke-free products made up more than 45% of Q4 net revenues. Our Q4 adjusted HTU share increased by plus 1.2 points to 9.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. A key driver is the growing uptake of ILUMA, which is available to around 90% of IQOS users in the region after eight further launches during the quarter. In the EU, 11 markets making up nearly 30% of regional IQOS volumes adopted the Delegated Directive to implement a characterizing flavor ban on heated tobacco products and implemented clean-shelf policies in October. While still early days, we estimate only a small impact on offtake as consumer adjust as well as on trade inventory levels.

Indeed, adjusted IMS volumes continue to exhibit very good sequential growth and reached a record high 12.4 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. This reflects double-digit year-on-year progression of plus 13% in Q4, despite the lack of growth in Ukraine. We expect the remaining EU markets to adopt the characterizing flavor ban in 2024 and estimate a full year consumer adjustment impact of around 2 billion units on both shipment and IMS, representing less than 5% of regional volume and less than 2% of total PMI. This is consistent with other past flavor restrictions, such as the EU ban applied to combustible in 2020. Based on the initial data from market that have enacted the ban, our fundamental view remains the same.

We do not expect a meaningful change in the structural trajectory of the category and indeed expect Europe adjusted IMS progression to be broadly in line with the group growth rate in 2024. Europe is also an important geography for innovation. LEVIA's zero-tobacco HTUs were launched in the Czech Republic in mid-October through limited channels, with an encouraging initial response. We plan a broader Czech roll-out later this month and further market launches this year. In Japan, the heat-not-burn category now represents close to 40% of the total industry, with IQOS driving its growth and reaching over 8.5 million adult users. In Q4, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brand increased by plus 3.1 point to 27.6% with offtake share surpassing 34% in Tokyo.

Adjusted IMS volume increased by plus 14.5% year-over-year for 2023 and plus 13.4% in Q4 alone, reaching a record high of almost 10 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. Such impressive growth in a market with already high category penetration is a clear testament to the sustainable potential of IQOS around the world. HTU shipment volume returned to a more normalized state in the fourth quarter as compared to a tough prior year inventory comparison, following the substantial completion of the transition back to sea freight in Q3. In addition to strong IQOS share gain in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle-income markets.

This slide highlights a selection of Q4 key city offtake shares across market in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Egypt continues to impress with Cairo offtake share up plus 3 points to 9.4%, also noting encouraging result elsewhere in the region, such as Morocco and Lebanon. Indonesia also saw notable progress in its capital city, especially given limited commercialization. We continue to see dynamic offtake volume growth across these important future markets, with the city share towards the right of this chart, an indication of the exciting potential. While we have already covered the margin dynamics on combustibles, our 2023 commercial performance was very robust, with organic top-line growth of plus 5.5%.

This reflects both strong pricing, with notable contributions from Germany and Indonesia, and positive share performance within a resilient international category. Our cigarette category share grew by plus 0.1 points in Q4 and plus 0.2 points in 2023, with notable contributions from Egypt, Poland, and Turkey. Although flattered by competitor supply constraints in Egypt, which may normalize in '24, we again achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share excluding this effect, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This remains key as our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products. This combustible share performance, combined with a structural growth of IQOS, led to an increase of plus 0.6 points of international cigarette and HTU share for the full year.

As mentioned previously, our superior share of smoke-free products gives us a formidable platform for sustainable share gains, with superior unit economics. Before we turn to the 2024 outlook, let me briefly reflect on our strong delivery over the past three years in spite of a number of substantial headwinds. The performance was clearly positive compared to our currency-neutral 2021-2023 target of more than 5% organic top-line and more than 9% bottom-line growth, supported by overall growing volumes. For the next few years, we target a similar strong volume delivery, a plus 6% to plus 8% organic net revenue CAGR, and a step-up in organic operating income growth to plus 8% to plus 10%.

We target an adjusted EPS CAGR of plus 9% to plus 11% ex-currency growth at constant 2023 corporate tax rate, including an increase in net financing costs, which skews toward the first year of the period in 2024. Okay, this brings me to the outlook for 2024, where we expect a strong acceleration in smoke-free performance across IQOS volume, smoke-free net revenue, and gross profit. We forecast the highest ever absolute increase in HTU adjusted IMS volumes to deliver plus 14% to plus 16% growth in percentage terms, despite the inclusion of an estimated impact of around 2 billion units from consumer adjustment to the EU characterizing flavor ban I mentioned earlier, and essentially, no offtake growth in Russia.

For shipment volume, we target more than 140 billion units, subject to the usual inherent volatility of shipment timing, new market launches, and potential supply chain disruptions, such as the ongoing situation in the Red Sea. While shipment growth rates naturally follow adjusted IMS over time, there is a possibility of some lower inventory level compared to 2023, given the substantial completion of ILUMA launches and opportunities for working capital optimization. We expect continued excellent U.S. ZYN volume growth to around 520 million cans. We have also accelerated our capacity expansion plan to support this further significant step-up in volume and to manage inventory level, which are naturally affected by the recent level of growth.

Such a strong outlook for IQOS and ZYN means we expect to deliver an acceleration in organic smoke-free top-line growth compared to 2023, reaching close to $15 billion in net revenue at prevailing exchange rates. This supports a total PMI forecast of plus 6.5% to plus 8% organic net revenue progression, including a fourth consecutive year of total volume growth and mid single-digit combustible pricing. We also forecast an acceleration in smoke-free gross profit growth from the organic plus 19% delivered in 2023 as IQOS profitability expands and ZYN's excellent economics continue. We expect smoke-free to again drive the lion's share of our forecast organic OI growth of plus 8% to plus 9.5%, notably given the enduring cost pressure and negative geographic mix in combustible I just mentioned.

This naturally implies organic margin expansion, even factoring in the ongoing technical dilution impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia. We expect a meaningful organic improvement in overall gross margin, excluding technical impact, and a very limited currency impact on adjusted OI margin. This forecast includes notable capability investment in the U.S., but as mentioned at Investor Day, we still expect to deliver strong double-digit operating income growth in this market. As flagged at the last year Investor Day, we anticipate an increased net financing expense this year as debt is renewed at higher rates. We forecast a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as compared to $1.1 billion in 2023. We also assume a higher effective corporate tax rate due to Russia's suspension of certain double tax treaties and earnings mix.

These tax and interest factors combined impact our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth projection by around 2 percentage points. Accordingly, we forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 9%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.32 to $6.44, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.11 at prevailing rates. This notably includes a net favorable impact of $0.13 related to the revaluation of monetary balances in hyperinflationary economy in 2023, skewed to the second half comparison. Moving to the shape of expected 2024 performance on a quarterly basis, we anticipate good double-digit growth in adjusted IMS HTU growth every quarter, supporting the full year forecast of plus 14% to plus 16%.

We forecast a strong Q1 overall, with HTU shipment volume of 31 billion to 32 billion and continued strong volume growth from ZYN. We expect organic top-line and operating income growth to be broadly consistent with the full year outlook, which implies organic margin expansion as with the full year. We project strong Q1 currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 10 %. This translates to a range of $1.37 to $1.42, including a negative currency variance of $0.10 at prevailing rates, with currency comparison improving in the second half as we lap the Argentina impact of 2023. Our business remains highly cash generative. However, the $9.2 billion in 2023 operating cash flow was lower-than-expected.

This was due to currency effect on net earnings, including the Argentine peso devaluation, other year-end currency impact, and higher-than-expected working capital needs. In 2024, we target between $10 billion and $11 billion in operating cash flow at prevailing exchange rates and subject to working capital requirements. We continue to prioritize investing in innovation and the growth of our smoke-free portfolio. In 2024, we expect capital expenditure of around $1.2 billion, including the ZYN capacity expansion I just mentioned. Deleveraging remains a key priority for us, and as expected, our 2023 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was around 3x, given the 2023 purchase of the remaining Swedish Match minority and the final U.S. IQOS payment to Altria.

We target much better progress of 0.3x to 0.5x deleverage in 2024, driven by continued EBITDA growth and strong cash flow generation. We continue to target a ratio of around 2x by the end of 2026, with buybacks to be considered once confirmed we are on track. Finally, our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and in line with our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders.

I will now turn it back to Jacek for concluding remarks.

Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
Thank you, Emmanuel.

Let me now take a moment to cover our key strategic priorities for 2024. First is supporting the sustained growth momentum of IQOS through continuous innovation. This includes leveraging the roll-out of ILUMA to maximize user growth, while innovating further on both devices and consumables. Second is to continue the strong U.S. growth of ZYN, supported by targeted commercial investment, long-term capacity expansion and organizational infrastructure, which will also support IQOS. Outside the U.S., we intend to continue developing our integrated multicategory offering to adult nicotine users with further launches of ZYN, and where relevant, our VEEV e-vapor portfolio. Of course, 2024 will be a landmark year for IQOS in the U.S. While the ultimate launch of IQOS ILUMA is the main priority, we continue to prepare for the first city tests of the IQOS 3 blade product starting in Q2 this year.

These small-scale pilot launches will allow us to experiment with different aspects of commercialization and support our drive for at-scale commercial success once ILUMA is authorized. While we have no update on the expected PMTA timeline, the patent settlement agreement announced last week allows for commercialization of both blade and induction products while mitigating risks of patent-related disruption and enables us to leverage the scale, optimized cost and flexibility of our global supply chain. In combustibles, we continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization, while taking judicious pricing actions to drive a positive profit contribution. Our capital allocation priorities are crystal clear. We will continue to invest in the growth of smoke-free products, and our commitment to the dividend remains steadfast.

Following the acquisition of Swedish Match, deleveraging remains our key balance sheet objective. We aim to continue our excellent progress on sustainability initiatives, including those related to product impact, such as youth access prevention and post-consumer waste. Finally, and importantly, we remain committed to transforming the tobacco harm reduction landscape by providing superior alternatives to adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking and advocating for science-based regulations. We will be expanding further on many of these topics at the CAGNY Conference in two weeks' time. Let me now conclude today's presentation. Overall, our business delivered a strong 2023 performance in the face of notable cost headwinds, driven by structural smoke-free momentum. The continued excellent performance of IQOS and remarkable growth of ZYN strengthened their positions as leading brands with excellent equity.

Combined with our unrivalled commercial and innovative capabilities, we have a powerful platform to expedite our smoke-free future as we broaden our portfolio and reach to adult smokers. We expect 2024 to be a year of accelerated growth for smoke-free products and remain confident in our 2024-2026 growth targets. We have exciting opportunities in the U.S. and internationally, which we are fully dedicated to capture as we progress towards our ambition of being substantially smoke-free by 2030. Finally, and importantly, our strong growth outlook and highly cash generative business underpins our ability to deleverage while returning cash to shareholders.

Thank you. And Emmanuel and I are now happy to answer your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)

Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Bonnie Herzog{BIO 1840179 <GO>}
Hi, everyone.

A - Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
Hi, Bonnie.

Q - Bonnie Herzog{BIO 1840179 <GO>}
I actually wanted to ask a high-level question on the year. You originally guided FX neutral EPS growth in '23 of 7% to 9%. Yet, you really did finish out the year a lot stronger, reporting 11% currency-neutral EPS growth. So, as you look back, what were some of the key areas of outperformance versus your initial expectations? And then as you think about this year, you're initially guiding to 7% to 9% FX neutral EPS growth again. So, just trying to understand how conservative this may be, especially considering your 9% to 11% mid-term growth target.

A - Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
So, Bonnie, with regards to 2023, I think the momentum which we have in the category as in Japan is really worth simplying out. And despite the fact that, as you know, IQOS occupies a very sizable part of the segment, I mean, we capture well above our segment share, I think we capture about 80% of the entire segment growth in Japan. So, this is very strong. Japan is on the forefront of a smoke-free transformation. We're approaching the year 10th anniversary of IQOS in Japan. And if I just look over the last few weeks, how categories continue these expansions in Japan, I think in the Tokyo area, the smoke-free products now about exceeded the size of the cigarette category. So, if IQOS continues after 10 years participating in this phenomenal growth, this is really worth simplying out. (Inaudible) and as we indicated very much, we've been very keen and very pleased that we could conclude the acquisition of Swedish Match.

That's the important element of our portfolio of alternatives to smoking, the pouches, and obviously creates a very good opening for us in entering the U.S. market, and ZYN clearly is growing above the expectations. What is very important, as we hear from time to time, quite rightly, conversations about some unintended consequences about the use of the product, I am so pleased that both IQOS and ZYN actually are delivering as they were designed for, i.e. going after adult smokers in the U.S. above 21 years. We all are familiar with the CDC data. Less than a 2% youth usage, as the same is for IQOS in international. So, we have a good -- my view is we have a very good, sustainable, growing two fabulous propositions in a smoke-free product, and we are also trying here to be very focused from a financial perspective with regards to the e-vape.

So, right now, roll this through to 2024, I think that Japan is on the good momentum, ZYN in the U.S. continues this momentum. Europe is doing very strongly, very well. Yes, we have this distortion, maybe potential headwinds we're getting there. We very clearly indicated the $2 billion potential impact from the flavor ban in the EU. But other than that, these key geographies, and these key geographies also are very important from the margin perspective, expansion, they really are on the positive side.

And I don't want to sound negative on the rest of the world. However, one thing you should note that on occasions there might be some conversations around the growth trajectory of IQOS and so on, and you remember during Investor Day, I've been very clear. We're running IQOS in 10 consecutive years of fabulous growth despite the fact that we essentially lost growth -- access to any growth in Russia and Ukraine. And historically, I mean, Russia alone was delivering, depends on which period you pick up, but easily about $4 billion, maybe even $5 billion per annum growth of the category. So, I think we need to look at this trajectory from this perspective, which makes me even more confident about our full year outlook.

Q - Bonnie Herzog{BIO 1840179 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you. That was helpful. And then I did want to ask a little bit more on margins. Just hoping for a little bit more color on your margins in Q4, especially in Americas where they were actually negative. I'm assuming, I think you called this out, a key driver of this is your investments ahead of the IQOS relaunch in the U.S. in May. So, in the context of this, how should we think about operating income growth in Americas this year? Will it continue to be negative? And then for the full year of '24, your -- just total company, your guidance is for FX neutral revenue growth and operating income growth does imply operating margin expansion. So, could you maybe touch on your expectations for gross margin and OpEx in the context of that? Thank you.

A - Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
Yes, Bonnie. Emmanuel can chip a little more details. I think in the Americas segment, there is more the impact of the devaluation in Argentina, which drove the margins down rather than the U.S. market. Now specifically about the U.S. market, yes, there is the increased investment also to continue supporting ZYN growth, ZYN expansion, but also preparing Swedish Match organizations, Philip Morris International in the U.S. organization, for being able to handle IQOS soon, and obviously have the organizations which is up to the opportunities and the challenges of the U.S. market. So, there is -- there are some investments which are already flowing through the P&L, even ahead of the IQOS start of commercialization. Emmanuel, you want to --

A - Emmanuel Babeau{BIO 4114796 <GO>}
Just to complement -- to answer your question, Bonnie, and complement what Jacek was saying on what is behind the higher-than-expected performance for '23, clearly Jacek described the very strong dynamic on the volume, on the commercial dimension if you want. But we've been very pleased as well with the development of our margin on our smoke-free product. And we are today seeing the margin both on IQOS and on ZYN being above the average margin on CC. We are making progress on the profitability of the IQOS product, and we have some price increase in Q4 overall. So, that was the planned dynamic, but it is happening, maybe even a bit better than what we're expecting, and we expect that to continue in Q4. And in that perspective, I mean, clearly the U.S. is a fantastic market.

We've described the fact that the margin of ZYN in the U.S. is best-in-class among our portfolio of products. And therefore, make no mistake, even if indeed we're going to continue to invest in the U.S., the U.S. is going to be super nicely accretive in all parameters of our P&L at the level of the, of course, revenue growth, but also at the level of the margin evolution and at the level of the operating income. And we reflect the fact that we talk about double-digit growth and very strong double-digit growth. The U.S. is a very powerful contributor to our financial performance.

Q - Bonnie Herzog{BIO 1840179 <GO>}
Okay. Emmanuel, if I may just clarify something then for this year, you are expecting gross margin and possibly op margin expansion based on your guidance? It implies op margin.

A - Emmanuel Babeau{BIO 4114796 <GO>}

We'll go next to Gaurav Jain with Barclays.

Q - Gaurav Jain{BIO 20455166 <GO>}
Hi. Good morning. Two questions from me. One is just to clarify the Argentinian peso impact. So, you have a $0.19 impact this year, which is linked to balance sheet revaluation. And on the slides, you are using the Argentinian peso rate, which is equal to the spot rate. So, there shouldn't be any further balance sheet revaluation down, which means that there is an automatic $0.19 benefit to EPS. Isn't that the way the math works?

A - Emmanuel Babeau{BIO 4114796 <GO>}
Look, of course, we cannot speculate on any further devaluation of the peso. The reality is that the amount in dollar term has been significantly reduced by the last devaluation. So, a further devaluation would impact to a much lower amount. Now I don't know whether more devaluation could come. Frankly, we're not able to anticipate this kind of thing. What you have to take into account is that the basis has been in fact halved basically with the devaluation in December. So, any further devaluation would apply to a lower base in Argentinian peso.

Q - Gaurav Jain{BIO 20455166 <GO>}
Sure. Maybe I can ask it separately. And my second question is around ZYN. We are hearing a lot of statements. We had a statement by Chuck Schumer, a lot of investors are concerned. They think that regulation is coming on ZYN. Flavors will get banned. So, how do you plan to get ahead of this entire potential controversy that could emerge around ZYN?

A - Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
Yes. So, as we observed over the last few weeks, I had a lot of conversations around the ZYN on social media, generally internet and media. I think, look, ZYN is in the U.S. market for 10 years, okay? And if you look even on the CDC latest data on the underage usage, et cetera, it stays well below I think 2%, which is the lowest from any product, nicotine and also other products where there's some age restrictions applied. I think we know what the Swedish Match marketing practices, and we were taking this very seriously during the acquisition at (Inaudible) region, et cetera.

We have said that the alignment with Swedish Match was not only that they were pursuing the smoke-free trajectory but also that they have a very responsible and a disciplined approach to the marketing, as we are on with IQOS, with Tidmouth Variant International. We have reached out to the few people who have been the most vocal during these conversations and Senator Schumer, but also to FDA. And I think the facts are different that sometimes it is being trying to be their positions in the media. So, the product is helping adult smokers with very strict age verifications. Obviously, when it comes to the conversations among the adults in the social media, that's going a little -- well, going, frankly speaking, in territories where we don't have controls. ZYN is not using any paid ambassadors or whatever this is being called in the social media.

So, we think what we're doing is pretty right. Product from the potential of a reduction of the harm and where the product is based on science position, then the risk reduction continuum is, frankly speaking, it is the best nicotine alternative to any other nicotine product, very much obviously versus the cigarettes. We have a pending PMTA with FDA, but I think the science is very strong and very conclusive on the side.

So, I feel very confident from the very beginning of our transformation. So was Swedish Match. We put the marketing and very much a protection of the youth very, very, very high on our agenda. So, I think it gives me the confidence that, as I said earlier to Bonnie's question, we have a progress, phenomenal growth on the products which are delivered in a very sustainable manner to adult smokers.

We'll go now to Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley.

Q - Pamela Kaufman{BIO 18021242 <GO>}
Good morning. I have a --

A - Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
Good morning, Pam.

Q - Pamela Kaufman{BIO 18021242 <GO>}
Morning. I have a question about ZYN as well. It's seen phenomenal growth in the U.S. Can you talk about what's driving the acceleration and growth in ZYN in the U.S.? And are there any particular regions where you're seeing stronger growth? And just on the ZYN guidance, it implies about 35% growth in U.S. shipments, but that seems conservative given the strength that we've seen. So, is there anything that would temper ZYN's growth outlook relative to what we're observing?

A - Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
Yes. So, the ZYN, as you might remember from Investor Day, the profile of the ZYN when it comes to where the smoke or where the adults are coming from, the ZYN is sourcing very nicely from a combustible cigarette, obviously, sourced from the oral categories, including the tobacco containing pouches or Swedish Suns or similar products, but also resourcing from the e-vape category. So, it is being recognized by the growing number of adults, the convenience of usage of the ZYN.

It is another way of looking at ZYN, it is a natural innovation or extension of the Swedish Snus product, the tobacco containing pouches. Obviously, as we know them, some people are not maybe comfortable of having a tobacco in the pouch. There are some optical hygienic type of maybe constraints, et cetera, and ZYN is something which is -- looks cleaner and is white, doesn't contain tobacco, which might have been for or might be for some consumer creates some resistance.

So, this is what I can say. I think the product has a good trajectory. The market is a large market in the U.S. with the well developed e-vape category obviously, but still a very sizable combustible cigarettes category, and also many other oral tobacco forms. So, it's a nice sourcing for ZYN, which is appealing to these audiences. With regards to your comments to avoid the number of accounts forecasted, which we put into our guidance for next year. We are very well familiar with them, like trends in the U.S. Can ZYN surprise us to the positive? Yes, okay? Can -- but guidance is built on the number of the assumptions, right?

I mean, it's a global business, multi category, and there are some headwinds, which we are aware of today. I'm not sure whether they will all materialize, but I think it's a matter of prudence, is that this part of the year, at the beginning of the year, to single them out and be prudent. But there are also some upsides and the tailwinds, which we are well aware of. The year unfolds, we'll come to the Q1. I mean, as of the year, you build the confidence as you go through the year.

A - Emmanuel Babeau{BIO 4114796 <GO>}
Yes. And to clarify the guidance here, we are coming with a growth year-on-year that would be similar than the one we've been experiencing in terms of total volume growth. I'm looking at the percentage here versus '23 and '22. So, these are similar volume growth, it's a reduction in the growth rate. We'll see whether we have things going even higher than what we're forecasting for the time being.

Q - Pamela Kaufman{BIO 18021242 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you. That makes sense. And a question on the patent settlement with BAT. Can you elaborate on the implications of that? I know you've been investing in manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. for IQOS. How does the settlement influence your ability to import into the U.S. and does it change your manufacturing strategy?

A - Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
It actually allows us now to look or connect IQOS in the U.S. to the supply chain, which is on the international supply chain from day one, which is operating with all the benefits of economies of scale, et cetera. So, obviously as the mitigating type of a strategy, we have been implementing in parallel the alternative manufacturing in the U.S., but that obviously is the first factory, first volumes. It would obviously result in the increased or elevated cost both on the devices and HeatSticks, and it will take a while until the U.S. on a standalone basis would close at the same level of the benefits of the cost, if you like, as we have done international. So, for us, it clears the path for IQOS, both blade and ILUMA.

So, we're bringing a lot of, or removing actually, I should say, uncertainty from today and going forward. And IQOS, because it is U.S., it's just another market which we added to the geographical family of IQOS presence from day one. We'll have an access, as I said, to the pipeline of the products and its economy cost benefits as an international market. So, for us actually, it's clarity and acceleration, which we gained through this agreement.

And obviously, as we all know, the patent litigation territory has a high degree of uncertainty. And we're running a very sizable business, and we plan to have even more sizable business, in addition now over U.S. And that clarity and the visibility going forward is very important and I believe is also important for investors, too.

We'll go next to Fahim Bey with UBS.

Q - Fahim Bey
Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thank you for the questions. I have a couple as well, please. Firstly, you're guiding for another impressive year of mid-teens heated tobacco in-market sales growth. You've highlighted Europe will be within that range. Historically, Europe has done slightly better. What markets make up the sort of difference to help you to still get to the mid-teens growth, if you could allude to the larger markets? And within that, are you assuming any contribution from Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, you mentioned, and what should we expect for the U.S. as well, please?

A - Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
So, maybe I start with the U.S. I mean, the U.S., we will do the test market on IQOS 3 -- what we call, IQOS 3.0 blade product, which is literally for us the IQOS, and we keep looking forward to get more visibility from FDA with regards to the PMTA, MRTPA for the IQOS ILUMA, which would allow us to accelerate the broader, more national type of the commercialization. So, what we have assumed in 2024 in terms of the volume contribution of IQOS from the U.S. is very minimal.

We're more treating this as, testing the engine, commercial, consumer facing type of a solution rather than go with the current version of the product at the full scale. We have assumed -- we made some assumptions with regards of opening the markets in which IQOS today is not allowed. The trade not on the list is obviously Taiwan, okay, that's -- it's our assumptions and we might be right or wrong. But these are the assumptions we've made. It obviously hinges on the speed of some regulatory decisions and the laws being passed and et cetera.

And with regards to Europe, look, I mean, although I believe and the history has shown with the flavor type of regulations in the different categories, in the different places that over a period of time, they don't have much of an impact to the goal. But we're going in a period that some markets, or markets will be implementing these regulations. So, I think in the -- I think we need to be cautious that there might be some distortions. I mean, we put in the guidelines and we were very transparent with $2 billion potential headwinds, which we typed in a volume outlook for IQOS. But we all have to see whether this materializes, not materializes but I think as a matter of prudence, we should talk about this.

Other than that, the underlying IQOS growth, if I look at the volume or share evolution in essentially all European markets, it's pretty strong. Despite the fact that very much in Central Europe, there is maybe more of the pricing competition from our InBev [ph] participants. But we also have a very strong price competition, extremely strong price competition, I should say, both on the devices and the consumables, consumables in Japan. And over the period of time, IQOS navigates through this highly, sometimes aggressive competitive pricing environment very well. So, that's essentially where we are. Germany grows very nicely. Italy continues with a very strong growth momentum. These are the major drivers. Spain, we make there -- we start making a significant progress. So, that's it for me.

Q - Fahim Bey
Yes. Thank you. And then just one other question, please. So, you're expecting a smoke-free acceleration in 2024, but that's not translating into group net revenue growth acceleration in 2024. Are you expecting a softer performance in combustibles in '24? Is that the discrepancy?

A - Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, look, this is the blended, at this moment in time, at the beginning of the year, the blended outlook for the group revenues, combustibles, oral and obviously heat-not-burn, with a few other smaller things. Look, we have managed last year to deliver a very strong pricing variance. I think, again, it's fair to assume that that level of a pricing variance may not be repeatable this year, but there is obviously a pricing potential which we have baked in, in the or included in the guidance. Look, for some of these things, we need a little bit more visibility to start increasing our confidence. I still believe that, if I compare what Philip Morris is delivering now and a number of the years when we lift the revenue top-line above 7%, and you remember very well the times when we started transformations where we were at 3% to 5% now.

I think a quality what counts for us, and this is what we pay a lot of attention, that we not only want to lift in a sustainable matter the revenue growth, but obviously important is the quality of that revenue growth. So, having a three years total group volumes to start with above while no decline, not even a flood, but a growing, then you start overlaying this by pricing and managing to -- focusing to avoid the risk of some down trading et cetera. I think that the 7% is there -- well, above 7% revenue growth is the pretty -- from a qualitative perspective, not just from the nominal growth perspective, I would think that it's hard to speak about.

A - Emmanuel Babeau{BIO 4114796 <GO>}
And just to add to what Jacek has just been saying, I mean, indeed taking into account that 2023 was exceptional when it comes to price increases, close to 9% on the combustible portfolio, and we don't intend to repeat that. We are guiding to a mid single-digit price increase for 2024. So, of course, that will have an impact and make a difference on the growth of our revenue on the combustible business.

We'll go next to Callum Elliott with Bernstein.

Q - Callum Elliott{BIO 20826092 <GO>}
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the questions, guys. I just wanted to start with disposable vaping products. We've obviously seen these products have huge success in the U.S. in 2023, and the UK also driving a steeper volume decline for combustible cigarettes in those markets. Obviously, your combustible cigarette business in those two markets is not huge, if non-existent obviously in the U.S.. So, not a huge impact on your business so far. But my question is, why do you think we haven't seen equivalent success for these products in the markets that are big markets for your business and the EU in particular? And do you think this could be a threat to your business in 2024?

A - Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
You mean the threat to our business coming from e-vape products, because we were up -- there are a number of factors, right? So, one is that I think that the category of e-vape product is being disposable, it's not disposable, it's very much focused in terms of the offering and innovation, frankly speaking, into the flavors, right?

Then we very often forget that the core of the smokers, market by market, with literally few exceptions, are very much on the, what I would characterize as a traditional tobacco type of experience, flavor, et cetera. So, this creates sort of a more dual consumption or occasional consumption. But I think for some smokers, and we know it from our experience of IQOS, it actually triggers curiosity to try, but at the same time, triggers the bottleneck in terms of full-time type of a switching adoption. So, that's the one of the factors, okay? And -- but there are obviously other factors at play.

Q - Callum Elliott{BIO 20826092 <GO>}
I guess I understand that, Jacek. But why hasn't that -- it seems like in the U.S. and the UK, that hasn't been an impediment to these products' success over the past 12, 18 months?

A - Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
That is also the focus, right, because UK was on the forefront as was U.S., which I remember historically on the forefront of this category, partially, I guess, also attracted by the underlying margins in the CC category. So, obviously people are going with alternatives to the places which create some sort of that underlying margins opportunity with the relative freedom also to talk about this product. As you know, Europe very much, but also in international, some countries, these products are not very, let me put it that way, warmly welcomed.

So, let's leave aside the hard reduction principles, but some other opinions and views at play. We know that when we enter the e-vape category, but we're trying to be very disciplined or focused, I should say, it's very easy to enter into this category without too much of the path to sustainable profitability. And we don't want to defocus the company from some other opportunities which we are pursuing, which in our views are more sustainable and offer a good path for the margins and the underlying profitability.

But when we enter with this product, we probably check a few other markets, I mean, our products, despite the fact that we're relatively late into the -- from a category history perspective. I mean, we have gained double-digit shares in this market in the speed or span of less than 12 months or so. So, it also tells you there is a lot of lack of loyalty in this. There's a lot of -- yes, I know that we see the volumes, but there's a lot of trials. I should not blame category and the parties judge by performance in the U.S. I mean, by definition, the consumer is more loyal, more focused, more disciplined in how they navigate it.

Q - Callum Elliott{BIO 20826092 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you. And I have a follow-up that is related, but maybe a slightly more philosophical question. In a number of markets, and especially the U.S., related to some of these disposable vaping products, we've been seeing this formation of, I would describe it as like a dual-tiered market that's been forming with big legacy players, such as yourselves, who are sort of forced to play by the rules and hold themselves to a certain set of standards, marketing only to existing nicotine users, and all of us will have seen your video on ZYN last week, I would imagine.

And -- but at the same time, we also have a secondary set of smaller new businesses who seem to be doing basically whatever they want, and often illegally, but having great success within the marketplace and attracting lots of consumers. And so, I guess my question is, do you think that this dual-tier structure that seems to be forming in a number of markets structurally impairs the attractiveness of your business and your brands when it seems like you're just being forced to play on a playing field which is not level?

A - Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
Well, look, obviously companies like ours is not even thinking about doing something which would be against or crossing the line of regulations or even, I would say, societal expectations.

So, obviously, I mean, our ability to compete is what you're asking, grossly different than some other operators or participants in the market, especially people who don't have a view of 10 years or 15 years outlook but is essentially hit and run almost type of operation. And I think we know what has happened and what is happening in the U.S.

Yes, I understand some discipline in the market is now underway, but frankly speaking, is a long overdue because there is a lot of, pardon my language, but the mess created in the market by the fact that regulators, law enforcement, and other designed for this -- designated for these agencies will be a bit slow.

And I think, it's a, frankly speaking, replica which we have for many years, and still in some places have on a cigarette market. And it forms of a illicit type of a participation in the market. It's not only marketing practices, but also products, product standards. All of these things creates completely wrong distortions in the market that the expense of the legitimate tobacco category manufacturers and also diverts the conversation from how further we can progress and have reductions, diverts them into the things which relatively easily should be fixed.

Our final question will come from Matt Smith with Stifel.

Q - Matt Smith{BIO 21701509 <GO>}
Hi. Thank you, Jacek and Emmanuel.

A - Emmanuel Babeau{BIO 4114796 <GO>}
Hi, Matt.

Q - Matt Smith{BIO 21701509 <GO>}
Wanted to ask a follow-up question about investment levels embedded in the 2024 outlook. If we consider the expectation for gross and operating profit margin expansion on an organic basis, can you talk about the areas where you're seeing a step-up meaningfully in incremental investment? Last year, you called out $150 million of explicit investments, including $75 million or so in the U.S. It would seem like the growth in ZYN would allow you to step that investment level up while still being able to achieve your double-digit profit expectations in the market.

A - Jacek Olczak{BIO 15910331 <GO>}
Yes. So, on the one hand, obviously, we target adjusted OI growth above our revenue growth. So, obviously, we are assuming some improvement in the margins. But on the other hand, I think we will have enough of the resources to support that revenue growth. So, if it's -- if we would completely stop investing, obviously the expansions on the OI growth would be much more significant, margins expansions will be much more significant. But we are -- it is not what we see in our strategy. So, I think once you operate at it scale, and we do, as ZYN has set the scale in the U.S., the revenue is very substantial over there, at least by the U.S. market standards.

And the revenue which we generate from the smoke-free but also combustibles on the international with that sort of a revenue growth rate, I think we have a room to provide for the investments to support today's and tomorrow's growth while also allowing for the -- or driving the margin expansion. We also have provided here some inflationary pressure. And I think especially on the combustible, I would assume that the '24 is a sort of a last year of this extra ordinary type of inflationary pressure. And as of '25 and onwards, we should start seeing easing on the cost pressures, this is about delivering some other materials. And I think every incremental IQOS and every incremental ZYN is obviously -- it requires proportionally less of the investment with the first IQOS and the first ZYN. So, I mean, the scale offers, going forward, there's opportunity for supporting the margin.
