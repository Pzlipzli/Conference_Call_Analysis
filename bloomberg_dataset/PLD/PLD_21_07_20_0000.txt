Presentation
Operator
Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Prologis Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, we will have a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)

It's now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Tracy Ward. Tracy, I hand it to you.

Tracy Ward{BIO 16503067 <GO>}
Thanks, Sally and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.

I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.

Additionally, our second quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures, and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Dan Letter, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly and Colleen McEwan are also here with us today.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom, will you please begin?

Thomas S. Olinger{BIO 15170451 <GO>}
Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. The second quarter exceeded our expectations, both in terms of our results and outlook for 2021 and beyond. With our exceptional portfolio and team, we set high watermarks across several measures this quarter. Demand for space is robust and diverse and market conditions remain the healthiest in our 38-year history.

In the second quarter, lease signings were 64 million square feet and lease proposals were 84 million square feet, both remained above average and were driven by new and development leasing. Likewise, at the largest IBI Customer Activity Index reached a new high in the second quarter, and early indicator of strong future demand. Our leasing mix is broad. Currently, the greatest demand is for spaces above 100,000 square feet. For smaller spaces, activity is picking up. We signed 518 leases totaling 18 million square feet in the quarter, the highest volume in this segment in three years.

For customer segments, e-commerce continues to lead the way, representing 30% of new lease signings in the second quarter. While Amazon remains steady at 6% of total new leasing, we have seen many more e-commerce players come to the table. For example, we signed 168 new e-commerce leases in the first half of 2021 versus 53 in the first half of last year. Supply chains are racing, beginning to restart. And as they do, it will create more demand going forward.

Containerized imports are up 33% through May versus pre-pandemic levels as retailers replenish their supply chains. While inventories have risen 3% from their trough, they have struggled to grow this year as retail sales are up 19% from pre-pandemic levels. We see the current low level of inventories in our space utilization, which at 84.3% is below the long-term average of 85%. This is yet another sign that our customers are operating with sub-optimal levels of inventory.

Putting together recent outperformance and ongoing momentum, we are raising our 2021 U.S. forecast for net absorption by 20% to 360 million square feet and deliveries by 8% to 325 million square feet. Looking forward, we foresee continued supply balance by demand with historic low vacancy of 4.5% carrying into 2022. With balance demand and supply, acute scarcity in our markets is driving the record rent and value growth. Our operating portfolio lease percentage rose by 80 basis points to 97.2% at quarter end.

Customers continue to compete for space and are making decisions faster with lease gestation in the quarter of just 44 days. When we look at the factors impacting supply, significant barriers exist in our markets and include a lack of buyable land, increasingly difficult and expensive permitting and entitlement processes and rapidly escalating replacement costs. Our research team released an excellent paper on this last month, which you can find on our website.

Our supply watchlist remains quite small. We reviewed Houston in the quarter, leaving just Spain and Poland. Accelerating demand in the quarter combined with ultra-low vacancies translated to a very strong rent growth of 4.1% in our U.S. markets, exceeding our expectations. As a result, we are raising our 2021 rent forecast an all time high of 10.3% for the U.S., up approximately 40 basis points from our prior estimate, and 8% globally, which is up 300 basis points. Our in-place to market rent spread is now the widest in our history at 16.9%, up 330 basis points sequentially. This represents future gas in the tank of nearly $700 million in NOI or $0.90 per share.

Turning to valuations. Our assets have strongest quarterly uplift in our history, rising 8% in the second quarter alone with the U.S. up more than 10% and Europe up 5.6%. On the topic of valuation, I want to point out that we enhanced the NAV disclosure in our supplemental related to property management fees. Given the size and scale of our portfolio, we create substantial value through our operational advantages. As a result, we know the real estate is worth more in our hands. Accordingly, we are now including net property management fee income as component of adjusted NOI in our NAV disclosure.

Switching gears to results for the quarter, our team and portfolio continued to deliver excellent financial results. Core FFO was $1.01 per share with net promote earnings effectively zero, rent change on rollover was 32%. Occupancy at quarter end was 96.8%, up 110 basis points sequentially. Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated by 5.8%, up 290 basis points year-over-year.

We tapped into favorable market conditions and disposed off $880 million of non-strategic assets across our portfolio. In addition, just last week, we completed the sale of $920 million owned and managed portfolio including all of the non-strategic IPT assets. It's worth noting that to date, we have sold $2 billion of non-strategic assets from our IPT and LPT acquisitions by pricing more than 23% above underwriting.

Turning to strategic capital. Our team raised almost $600 million in the second quarter. Equity cues from our open-ended vehicles (Technical Difficulty) at quarter end, hitting another all-time high. Robust investor interest has prompted private equity limited partners to shift away from diversified to more sector specific funds, particularly for the logistics sector. In light of recent asset management transactions and public comps, the value being ascribed to our strategic capital business is meaningfully understated. For the balance sheet, we continue to maintain excellent financial strength with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicles totaling $14 billion.

Moving to guidance for 2021. Our outlook has further improved given higher rent growth, higher valuations and robust demand. Here are the key updates on our share basis. We're increasing our cash same-store NOI growth mid-point by 75 basis points to now range between 5.25% and 5.75%. We expect bad debt expense to be approximately 10 basis points of gross revenues, down from our prior guidance to midpoint of 20 basis points and well below our historical average.

We are increasing the midpoint for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes to $470 million, up $15 million from prior guidance. This upward revision is due to increased asset management fees resulting from higher property values. Faster development lease-ups and higher asset values are also leading to an increase in promotes. We now expect net promote income of $0.02 for this year, an increase of $0.04 from our prior guidance. We're also increasing development starts by $300 million and now expect a midpoint of $3.2 billion. Build-to-suits will comprise more than 40% of development volume.

Our owned and managed land portfolio, which is composed of land, options and covered land place supports $18 billion of future development over the next several years. We are also increasing the midpoint for dispositions and contributions by $650 million in total. This increase will have roughly a $0.02 drag on earnings this year given the timing to redeploy incremental proceeds. We now expect to generate net deployment sources of $200 million at the midpoint with leverage remaining effectively flat in 2021.

Taking these assumption into account, we're increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.07 and narrowing the range to $4.04 to $4.08 per share. Core FFO excluding promotes will range between $4.02 and $4.06 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 13%. We continue to maintain exceptional dividend coverage, and our 2021 guidance implies a payout ratio in the low-60% range and free cash flow after dividends of $1.3 billion.

In closing, the first half of the year has been extraordinary and our outlook is equally promising. Visibility into our strong future organic earnings potential is very clear. We have a significant embedded in place to market rent spread, the development ready land portfolio, substantial balance sheet capacity and ability to create value for our customers beyond the real estate.

With that, I'll turn it back to Holly for your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)

(Operator Instructions) And our first question is going to come from the line of Steve Sakwa, Evercore ISI.

Q - Steve Sakwa{BIO 1504010 <GO>}
Thanks. Good morning out there. Maybe Tom or Hamid, I was just wondering if you could spend a little more time just talking about some of the demand drivers across some of the various sub-sectors and maybe regionally. I know Europe maybe grew a little bit faster, but maybe just provide a little more context around which businesses and which regions are seeing the most demand.

A - Chris Caton{BIO 20098244 <GO>}
Hey, Steve. It's Chris Caton. I'm going to jump in with a few highlights and then I think Gene will share some color. I think there are three or four demand trends that are presenting themselves. The first is broadly the diversification of e-commerce, so internationalization of the major players, or smaller mid-sized players stepping up. The second is the growth leaders of last year in leasing space, think about food companies, pharmaceuticals and durable goods companies. And the third trend would be supply chain resilience, for example, we see the core markets are among the strongest they've ever been. So you have several clear themes playing through demand.

A - Eugene F. Reilly{BIO 3378125 <GO>}
Yeah. So Steve, the only thing I'll add to that, if you want to get some geographic color is, coastal markets are definitely doing better. If you look at the U.S., Southern California and New Jersey by far, I think have the strongest demand and dynamics. But it also says that it's very difficult to find a weak market globally, whether you're in Latin America, Europe, the U.S., there's strength in demand really everywhere.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question is going to come from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.

Q - Emmanuel Korchman{BIO 18703095 <GO>}
Hey, good morning, everyone. Chris, maybe that's another one for you, but you spoke about broad-based demand but is the specific demand from especially the e-commerce customers changing at all? Are they kind of willing to get whatever they can? Are they being more specific as to what they want? Are the pinpointing markets is it a wider sort of paint brush of demand? Can you help us figure out what they're actually asking for when they come to you?

A - Chris Caton{BIO 20098244 <GO>}
Yes. So, the message on e-commerce is actually -- it's very diverse. And I think if you look across the maturity of different organizations, they all want something slightly different. So, if you have a large international player, I do think they're getting much more pinpointed. We've seen a lot of growth, for example, in last touched sub-markets, there's a lot of focus on shortening of delivery times. But more midsize organizations might be in an adjacent location or in an regional location to still build out the basic infrastructure for executing online.

Operator
And our next question is going to come from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Caitlin Burrows{BIO 18875287 <GO>}
Hi, good morning, team. I was just wondering if we could talk maybe about development. Prologis is obviously an active developer, you increased your guidance for development starts and stabilizations, and also the contributions. So could you give some detail on how you think about your development business' valuation? How the development gains are related to that? And how it might be different than peers' activity? I know that's a lot.

A - Hamid R. Moghadam{BIO 1739296 <GO>}
Hey, Caitlin, thanks for your question. This time I'll take a first shot at that. I think there are several aspects of our development business that are quite unique. The first, I would just think looking at the size of that portfolio, $18 billion of build out, almost 20% of our market cap. And that portfolio is very focused in our high-barrier markets in which we operate. So, we've got a land bank that we can build out, a very, very high quality portfolio that's in high demand. It's very diversified across 19 different countries and it's a huge opportunity set that our development platform has to build out, just having the menu to seek the best returns and to solve customers' problems across all of those different markets is a huge advantage.

And I think that leads to just the durability of those development gains. So if you look at our track record, we've got a track record of 20 years developing $37 billion of assets, 20% unlevered IRR and we give those results verified externally by Dr.Belf by the way. So an incredible track record of durability. So when you look at the $18 billion of build out, our history of being able to continue to develop that very, very attractive rates, if there's a very, very long runway of opportunity that's just presented in front of us.

And then to your point on realized gains, I think that's another point that makes us quite unique that given our capital structure and how we're -- how we want to structure the vast majority of our assets outside the U.S. are held in funds, but we're developing the vast majority of those assets on balance sheet in Europe, Japan, Mexico. And those assets, with very few exceptions, are contributed into our funds. So there's a real crystallization of those gains. So, when you think about the 20% unlevered IRR's, all that development, the vast majority of those gains were realized in cash and that's a real cash flow that is part of your AFFO, and should be embedded in your valuation.

And I think when we look at valuation in particular for development, I think there's a very scattershot approach because there's a couple of different things you have to do. Obviously, you've got to see IP that's in front of you, you got to finish that and value that, you've got your land bank, in our case $18 billion that you have to value. And there's also residual for this platform, right? This platform has a history of $37 billion and 20% unlevered IIRs, there is a value here. So I think you can put those all together, there's different ways to do it. And obviously what -- I would just encourage you to take a look at the cash flows that this thing generates historically. And I think you're going to find the valuations part or development capabilities are, I would say, significantly undervalued.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question will come from the line at Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Market.

Q - Craig Mailman{BIO 16661011 <GO>}
Hey, everyone. I appreciate the update there where you think market rent growth is, and clearly your net absorption stats as well just looks like we're still in equilibrium. But I'm just curious, and you guys talk to tenants and kind of continue to push through rents or maybe even accelerate that, how has the conversation changed now with labor shortages continuing and maybe even getting a little bit worse places and just gas prices continue to rise and impacting the transportation side? I mean, are rents even -- how high up on the list are they at this point, maybe update us on how many deals you're losing as a result of rent versus other factors? That's a few questions.

A - Eugene F. Reilly{BIO 3378125 <GO>}
Yes, this is Gene, I'll take that. So, I think your -- if you look at the conversations we're having with customers on what their pain points are relative -- excuse me.

A - Hamid R. Moghadam{BIO 1739296 <GO>}
Gene is having a little bit of issue with the abscess tooth, so let me just cover while he clears his throat. So, the conversations are mostly around labor, that is absolutely a pain point. But they are -- there's an ability to push through pricing today, because when you have retail sales jump 20% from pre-pandemic levels and god knows what percent from pandemic levels, and the supply chain is dry and there's very little probability of losing that piece of business, because people are flushed with cash and out there spending money, I think this is going to continue for a while. So basically, everybody's hair is on fire, trying to keep up with demand. And Mike, any additional color on that?

A - Michael S. Curless{BIO 17075359 <GO>}
Yeah, I think while we can really represent this is the fact that we've had more customers competing over space than we've seen ever before, and that creates some difficult situations where we always start with transparency with both parties. But I got to tell you, the rent becomes a very minor discussion, just the availability and accessibility in that space becomes the priority. So I think that's a good description of what we're seeing out there in terms of the customers' priorities.

A - Hamid R. Moghadam{BIO 1739296 <GO>}
Craig, I wish we were losing more deals because of rent, because we actually look at that on a quarterly basis by geography. And the number is under 5%, which to me it means we may not be pushing rents enough. So, in a way, the fact that we're not losing those deals to rents may not be such a great thing.

A - Eugene F. Reilly{BIO 3378125 <GO>}
Maybe let me jump in here and continue my point. But with respect to gas prices, that pretty much makes location all the more important. So I think that's probably a tailwind with respect of rents.

Operator
And our next question is going to come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.

Q - Vikram Malhotra{BIO 17484375 <GO>}
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe wanted to build up on comments around the strategic capital business. You referenced several times the power of the business and potentially being undervalued, I'm assuming that's on the equity side. As I talk to my colleagues who cover the Asset Managers, there's clearly different multiples that you used to value some of these larger or asset management platforms. Maybe you can unpack this for us a little bit, in terms of the power of the business, the more focused customer base you're seeing that are focused on logistics only platforms, and then just a valuation would be really helpful.

A - Thomas S. Olinger{BIO 15170451 <GO>}
Vikram, Thomas. I will take that first. So, I think let's start with that business and how that business has grown. If you look over the last five years, AUM and revenues of that business have grown 18%, some 18% CAGR. More importantly, the EBITDA, our cash flow that that business is generating is -- has grown by 26% CAGR, so incredible growth.

As we look forward, just given what we're seeing, I think the opportunities are there for very strong continued EBITDA growth. So, I think that's a baseline I would think about there, a highly, highly scalable business for what we do. And relative to valuation, there have been clarity around valuation in this business has never been better, because there's been several transactions that have cleared the market lately, and you can certainly look at public comps.

I think for us, you need to look at the alternative asset managers as the right place to start. And while there are a lot of different ways, I think analysts and investors are looking at multiples. But when you pour through it all for the alternatives and the comps we're seeing, you're going to see multiples in the mid-20s on earnings, and those include promotes. So when you strip out promotes, you're seeing, for the best alternative asset managers, a multiple 30 or higher, and they're getting an X on promotes. So, yeah, that would tell you our business is, I would say, very undervalued. Because as you're thinking about how we compare to them, I think you need to think about the stickiness of our AUM, 90 plus percent of our AUM is in long life or perpetual vehicles.

We talked about the growth profile that we have, and then clearly there's incredible investor demand for our product, which is also lining-up to support growth. Our equity cue at quarter end with $3.3 billion an all-time high. So, happy to get into more discussions with you all on this going forward, but a lot of good visibility out there on valuation.

A - Eugene F. Reilly{BIO 3378125 <GO>}
Yeah, I would add two things which we sort of assume, but are important. First, the business is scaled, it's a $60 billion plus business. I mean, that puts us among the top of real estate asset managers anywhere by any measure, and we're focused on one property type.

So, that's a pretty significant market share in the most desirable market, so that plays to the premium. And also, I would say, we have the longest history of actually producing these returns. That goes back to AMD's early days in the mid of 80s. So both in terms of longevity, the quality of the income stream, these are not a bunch of closed-end funds that expire, these are, as Tom pointed out, very sticky and long life cash flow streams. I would argue that they have more leverage on the upside and the real estate cash flows that support that business because of the fee and promote structure.

So, for the life of me, I don't really understand why they're being valued the way they are, but we're going to do a better job of explaining that to people who follow this business, because we're honestly getting a lot of receptivity from those investors that really understand the sector.

Operator
And our next question will come from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.

Q - Jamie Feldman{BIO 20107893 <GO>}
Thank you. Following up to the last question, $14 billion of investment capacity, we've seen a good amount of large portfolios trade the last few years, but clearly pricing is getting more and more dear. And how should we think about your ability to do large-scale transactions to keep growing that business through acquisition?

A - Hamid R. Moghadam{BIO 1739296 <GO>}
We do not care one iota about external growth and through M&A. It is -- that is no skill of the management team, it's just multiple conversion. And this myth that's there that our size prevents us from growing fast, I would just invite people to look at the numbers, and you can strip out the M&A from that. So, M&A is opportunistic, never part of our business plan. And if we never had another dollar of M&A, I'll put our growth rate against anybody else's in any sector practical, frankly, overtime.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.

Q - John Kim{BIO 15332685 <GO>}
Thank you. Given the increase in the patent valuations this quarter, I was wondering if you could provide an updated view on exit cap rates in that spread between exit and going in yields when you and your partners are looking at investment?

A - Hamid R. Moghadam{BIO 1739296 <GO>}
Well, historically we pencil in a 50 basis point -- used to pencil in a 50 basis point increase in the residual calculation based on our rents projections and the like. But I think 50 basis points when cap rates were 9% was quite a bit. And when the cap rates are in the mid threes, that's even a great deal more on a relative basis. So we're mostly using about a 25% increase on residual calculations and 10 years out.

But again, we are an infinite life vehicle, when you invest in our REIT, you don't -- we just sell non-strategic assets, we don't sell our other assets that we like. You look at the dividend or the cash flow that comes off those assets and the growth rate of those assets, that translates into a very nice overall IRR, which is really the fundamental driver of value in our business.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of John Peterson with Jefferies.

Q - John Peterson{BIO 13387897 <GO>}
Great. Thanks. You guys in your press release mentioned that cash same-store NOI growth in the international portfolio was higher than the U.S., which I think is kind of a flip from what we've seen in recent years. But looking at the occupancy, the occupancy is still growing faster in the U.S. So maybe you could just talk about what's driving that higher international growth?

A - Hamid R. Moghadam{BIO 1739296 <GO>}
Tom, I'll take that. I think part of it was driven by strong results in Other Americas, and Europe was also strong. I think it's more of a reflection of an easier comp in Q2 of '20 than everything else. But listen, I think longer-term, I mean, by and large, particularly in Europe, the cap rates have dropped furthest in Europe over the last several years, that's been more of a headwind on rent growth. And I would expect, going forward, we're going to see whether its next year or the year after that, but we're going to see growth in our international markets be on par if not better than our U.S. markets.

A - Thomas S. Olinger{BIO 15170451 <GO>}
Yeah, I would also say that land, it's very difficult in the U.S., but it's even more difficult in Europe, because the government is a much bigger actor in allocating land out, and they really tie it to employment and they're not allowed to buy logistics. So, land supply is just that much more difficult.

Operator
And our next question will come from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.

Q - Blaine Heck{BIO 18910975 <GO>}
Great, thanks. So, we noticed turnover costs on leases ticked up this quarter, and those costs as a percentage of lease value have been trending up over the last four quarters, as has free rent. Just given the context that you guys are having the highest demand, you've ever seen, those increase -- that increase seems somewhat counterintuitive. So can you just get some color on what might be driving that increase and how we should think about those concessions going forward?

A - Thomas S. Olinger{BIO 15170451 <GO>}
Blaine, it's a good observation. What is driving that over the last four quarters, and particularly in the second quarter is higher levels of new leasing. So, new leasing in Q2 versus Q1 increased 40% sequentially. And new leases generally come with slightly higher concessions, slightly higher turnover cost as a result. And -- but the key is, we're looking at long-term economic, so yeah there's a little bit of short-term pain with that, but we're getting in what we believe to be a better cash flow and higher rents.

So I think that's the key, we're looking at the long-term economics here and we're getting that. I do think, and clearly over the last four quarters we've seen much higher levels of new leasing than in the past. I think that's going to moderate a bit going forward, but we're looking at the long-term endgame here and it's clearly the right economic decision making.

A - Hamid R. Moghadam{BIO 1739296 <GO>}
Yeah. The other issue you should keep in mind is that we're pushing rents a lot harder than we were before. So, likely to replace existing customers with the most efficient customers that have the highest value chain and the ability to pay. So, that reshuffle has been accelerated in the last 12 to 24 months.

Operator
And our next question will come from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.

Q - Michael Carroll{BIO 17527698 <GO>}
Yeah. I wanted to touch back on the earlier comments regarding the broadening out of tenant interests specifically from e-commerce players, I guess. And you say, you're seeing more demand from the smaller players, are these companies that are looking to in-source their logistics needs versus outsourcing it to three PLs? Or do they already have an in-sourced network and they're just looking to expand it right now, or is it a little bit of both?

A - Michael S. Curless{BIO 17075359 <GO>}
Hey, this is Mike. It's certainly a little bit of both. I think the bigger story here is, we get asked a lot of questions about is it all about Amazon? And while they've been very steady and robust in terms of their activity with -- this year, with actually plenty of back-end activity coming up in the next couple quarters. The bigger takeaway is, what Tom said in the earnings front-end here were, the other customers last year we leased about 59 Amazon -- 50 leases to non-Amazon e-com players, this time fast forward the number is three times as high, and it's a wide variety of smaller and larger customers. There are some big brand names in there like walmart.com or Mercado Libre in Latin America, JD.com. But the bigger story is, there's over 150 of these smaller more diversified players using a combination of in-sourcing and outsourcing. We really like that diversification there. And again, the story is just not all about Amazon.

A - Thomas S. Olinger{BIO 15170451 <GO>}
I think there's a frenzy of playing catch-up that is creating a lot of activity. I mean, I think people, if anything, the pandemic sort of suggested that they can't take business as usual in a very incremental approach with respect to their e-commerce strategy. And now they're realizing how important it is, and they'll just pedal to the metal, and that's showing up in our 3PL leasing statistics as well.

Operator
And our next question will come from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.

Q - Mike Mueller{BIO 3519301 <GO>}
Yeah, hi. Can you talk a little bit about your development margins on spec versus build-to-suit? And do you think we could see the mix, which I think you said is about 40% this year, drift down further?

A - Eugene F. Reilly{BIO 3378125 <GO>}
Yeah, Mike, this is Gene. I think the -- I think that's going to hold. In fact, I think we might see ultimately a higher build-to-suit percentage. And I'd be careful looking at the comparison of margins between build-to-suit and spec, because mix has an awful lot to do with it. How long the transaction has taken to negotiate has something to do with it. But I think in both cases, you can expect margins to creep up. We have cost increasing on us on the construction side, but we have returned compression and rent growth that's ahead of our underwriting expectations and that overwhelms the cost increases. So, I think, generally we're going to see margins expand.

And our next question will come from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird.

Q - David Rodgers{BIO 22065499 <GO>}
I'll maybe start with Mike or Gene. Wanted to ask on the inventory and the sales topic that you had mentioned earlier. Obviously, the big increase in sales and inventory is not keeping up. I guess, when you talk to the customers, what are they trying to solve for from an inventory to sales perspective? Maybe how does that vary between industries, if at all? And I guess, how do they take into consideration maybe interest cost, with interest going down does that change kind of their willingness to carry even more inventory in the near-term? Those kind of type of conversations and any color would be helpful.

A - Chris Caton{BIO 20098244 <GO>}
Hey, Dave. It's Chris Caton, I'll kick it off. So first off, as has been shared a few times, right now its fulfillment by any means necessary, trying to get goods into the country. Look, inventories are down 10% from pre-pandemic levels, and so it's really just a race to get levels in. As it relates to resilience, I do think we're starting to see this, but I think the specific numbers that people are looking at, they're not yet at the strategic planning phase, they're much more tactically focused on fixing their supply chains this year.

A - Hamid R. Moghadam{BIO 1739296 <GO>}
We're fresh off a supply chain conference four days ago, 75% of people we spoke with them and poll survey said increasing inventories do have resilience related issues is top of mind, and we're starting to see that play out.

And our next question will come from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street.

Q - Vince Tibone
Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on significant increase in your U.S. market rent growth forecast. I just wanted to get a little more color on which market you're seeing greatest improvement in fundamentals and reviews last quarter? And also, just here how high you're forecasting growth in Southern California and New Jersey and the likes?

A - Chris Caton{BIO 20098244 <GO>}
Hey, Vince. It is Chris Caton. So, indeed we did make a material increase. And look, I think the facts of the situation are really impressive. Rents in the U.S. are up nearly 7% just in the first half of the year, that's a record. And look, it's not just the U.S., rents are rising in Europe, they're up 2% so far this year. What I think about different categories, let's start with the coastal, the major markets on the coast, and we have had Toronto in there.

Typically these markets on an annual basis have outperformed by 250 to 400 basis points. Last year, that compressed as there was less differentiation, that differentiation has returned. And so we're going to see these coastal markets in Toronto hit mid-teens, I think, this year. And I -- based on some of the trends we discussed earlier, I'd say, we should expect to see this relative outperformance widen in the coming years. Hope that helps you.

A - Thomas S. Olinger{BIO 15170451 <GO>}
Vince, this is Tom. I'd just tag on the impact of that on our earnings, right? I mean, we were ruling, I don't know, 16%, 17% of our portfolio, it is a year now, so all this good news on rent growth is not coming through the P&L right away. So you need to look at the end-place to market which significantly gapped out this quarter now at almost 17%.

And as I said in my prepared remarks, that's almost $700 million of incremental NOI. And let's see where rent growth continues to go, but I would continue to think that inflation in markets is going to march a little higher.

A - Chris Caton{BIO 20098244 <GO>}
Yes. And one other thing I would add. As strong as rents have been in some of these the best markets, with today's rents, today's construction costs, and today's land cost, development doesn't pencil. So, when people are developing, that means they're thinking -- they may be wrong that rents have to grow quite a bit form here, or cap rates are going to compress significantly from here. I don't know which, and they may be wrong, but I can tell you that with today's marginal land cost and building cost, no way you come close to that clearing in margin in development.

And our next question will come from the line of Rob Simone with Hedgeye Risk Management.

Q - Robert Simone{BIO 20918138 <GO>}
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Kind of a two-part question for me to get back to your earlier comments on strategic capital. We took a shot at that valuation and I think Tom, your comments were really helpful. I think in many ways, we're probably too conservative. But on the growth rate side, so one of the things that a little bit tougher to handicap from the outside is, this like kind of the sustainable growth rate and your capital raising.

The deployments from contributions is a little more obvious from the numbers, at least historically. So, I was hoping you guys could comment on how you see the fundraising environment kind of proceeding over the coming years. And then also maybe secondarily to that, it's really interesting, this is the first year that the net income excluding promotes kind of subsumed your corporate G&A. So from a valuation perspective, how do you think about addressing that? It's obviously a huge benefit but a big change versus prior years.

A - Eugene F. Reilly{BIO 3378125 <GO>}
Hey, Rob. Let me take a shot at this. Today our third-party AUM is mid-60s billion. At the time of the merger exactly 10 years ago, the merger closed on June 30 of 2011 exactly 10 years ago it was 14. So, you do the math as to what the growth rate has been. But I think 10 years, it's got to be a pretty representative period, because we had some early not-so-great years in industrial and past couple years have been really good. But I haven't done the CAGR, but if you do the CAGR of between 14 and whatever, 16-plus, it's got to be pretty, pretty impressive, the guys are trying to do the math.

Anyway, you can do the math. It's certainly higher than what any valuation model will suggest, and I bet you it's higher than a lot of public company asset managers, it's 16% annual growth rate in third-party funds under management. So, and the limiter on that growth is not our ability to raise capital, we can go out there and raise -- garbage more capital than we have right now, it's just that we don't want to raise the capital if we think we don't have good deployment opportunities for it. So, we don't want our cues getting too long and investors to get frustrated, and we certainly don't want to have a big cue that forces deal-making like we see in a lot of other places.

A - Michael S. Curless{BIO 17075359 <GO>}
Yes. We think somewhere between $2 billion and $6 billion is a good capital over the course of last three years, depending on need. This year, you'll be interested to know that 60% of the new capital that's raised is from new investors, new to Prologis, so that really underscores the broadening of interest in the logistics sector. The other thing that I think you're going to find interesting is that 60% of the investors are now diligent in ESG as an imperative. So that really plays to our strengths. We've been an ESG leader for more than two decades, so I think that's a differentiated for PLD.

A - Thomas S. Olinger{BIO 15170451 <GO>}
Hey, Rob, I'd just also point out from -- you focused on equity raising, but these are -- open-ended funds bonds are extremely well levered, they are A-minus rated entities, they have significant financing capacity. So we've got a lot of runway just by using their balance sheets, much less ours. And then thanks for pointing at your point about G&A and scale, I think this just tells you the power of the scale of this businessed. We talked about the AUM growth, that's 16 in the last 10 years or 18 in the last five years, but it's all about cash flow and EBITDA, that's grown 26% CAGR in the last five years. And as we grow, the vast majority of that money is going to drop to the bottom line.

And our next question is going to come from the line of Tom Catherwood BTIG.

Q - Tom Catherwood{BIO 18791539 <GO>}
Excellent. Thank you, guys. Hamid, just one of the follow-up on your comment on industrial development not penciling out last quarter. I think you'd mentioned that replacement costs could increase by -- as much as 25% and that Prologis had gotten ahead of that by pre-ordering a lot of material, including steel. As we sit today, what are your current thoughts as far as input costs and how they could continue to trend? And is there a time frame in which you might kind of fully utilize the material you pre-ordered and we could see maybe more margin compression on the development side as you have to pay kind of market rates for those, what are your thoughts on that?

A - Hamid R. Moghadam{BIO 1739296 <GO>}
Yeah, in terms of our pre-purchasing steel, I didn't want to create the false impression that we've got our entire development program hedged on steel costs. And we're pretty much working through the steel that's been hedged. So, I don't think that's a big factor in forecasting margins going forward. My personal view is that some of these supply chain related issues that have impacted material costs are going to subside, and there's a period out there a year or two years out, where maybe the steel price escalation could reverse and get back on a sort of normal inflationary trend, once all the plants are back up and producing.

But the most important thing affecting margins is what Gene mentioned a little while ago, which is that cap rates are compressing and rents are growing faster than land costs and replacement costs are going up. So the margins if anything, are going to expand unless something material changes that I can't think of right now. Particularly given the outlook for demand, and when someone asked Chris about the different sectors and all that, notably absent in his sectors was housing. Housing is still not anywhere near its potential and it's a big consumer of warehouse space that hasn't even kicked in. And you know how low the housing inventory is and how much prices are going up in the housing sector. So, I expect actually that to be an additional engine of growth for demand.

And our next question will come from the line Ki Bin Kim with Truist.

Q - Ki Bin Kim{BIO 15825434 <GO>}
Thanks and good morning. I just want to go back to the land topic. You guys bought more land year-to-date than you did in 2020. Just Chris, a couple of broad questions. You already have a pretty sizable land base, I'm just curious about what the thinking is behind that, is it demand if it were good then you had to kind of secure market value land, people to work relatively soon? Or is there a longer-term element to it that, that you think that the demand is long-lasting and so good that you want to replenish the land inventory? And also, how should we think about that $18 billion of build out in their land bank today? Should we expect that to start to get smaller as we do more development or is this a level that you probably need to maintain just to keep things humming along?

A - Chris Caton{BIO 20098244 <GO>}
Yeah. A couple of things, Ki Bin. First of all -- in couple of different flavors. One is, raw unentitled land of which we buy some but not a lot. Second comes in the form of options that we actually don't buy, it doesn't show up in the period when we made the deal, it shows up in the period that we actually close the land options. So, I don't know the specifics for this quarter that you're looking at, but -- we can find that out. But it could be closing options that we negotiated many, many moons ago.

And finally, the infrastructure cost of improving land shows up as land, and it may not be actually new land and maybe just additional infrastructure on existing land. For example, in our Tracy Park, we're doing million-square-foot deals, like they're going out of style. And along with that we need to put the infrastructure in, and with that land we bought in 2012, but that infrastructure shows up as additional land.

Finally, an increasing percentage of our land is covered land place, and they have an income stream and they pencil as investments even if we weren't going to scrape them and redevelop them down the road. So, these are land purchases deals that are actually pretty attractive in their own right, but they also have an embedded upside in terms of developing new product on. Gene, can you say?

A - Eugene F. Reilly{BIO 3378125 <GO>}
Yeah. So, Ki Bin, if you look at that $18 billion build out, about 44% of it is either covered land place or option land. And if you look at how we are replenishing the land bank over time, we're sticking pretty much to those ratios. So, nearly 50% of it comes in those two categories. And with respect to the size of the land bank, it's got to grow. Our development program is growing and you're going to see the land bank grow along with it.

A - Chris Caton{BIO 20098244 <GO>}
A good example would be this Hilltop transaction that got all this attention that all of a sudden are we going to do retail business? No we're not going to do retail business. That's just another way of buying land with a yield on it. So -- but you know, it's chunky, it's $100 million, so that shows up as -- I can move the numbers around in a given quarter by quite a bit, but it's sort of land play at the end of the day.

(Operator Instructions) And our next question is a follow-up from Jamie Feldman Bank of America.

Q - Jamie Feldman{BIO 20107893 <GO>}
Thanks. I just wanted -- two quick follow-up questions. One is, going back to supply chain shortages, pleasantly surprised to see you raise your starts guidance and your stabilizations guidance. Would you say that we'll see that across the board in the sector or there's something specific about the PLD platform that let you continue on with your development plans?

And then secondly, you've mentioned housing is not yet at its full potential for demand, any latest thoughts on reassuring and what that could mean to demand and then anything coming out of Congress with the Infrastructure Bill, that could also be a driver of growth? Thank you.

A - Hamid R. Moghadam{BIO 1739296 <GO>}
Yes, on the infrastructures side, a lot of it is in infrastructure, this is I can tell. So I don't think those things are necessarily going to add a lot of business. But the real infrastructure part which is less than $1 billion should be really great for the business. On-shoring is -- I only see on-shoring in newspaper articles, I haven't really actually seen them. And if you look at the import numbers, we said month after month of records. And now I do think there will be on-shoring of medical supplies from PPE, and some of the things that are strategic to use an overused word. But generally speaking, we just don't have the resources, the infrastructure, the laborer, the know how to manufacture a lot of the things that come into containers. Anything else?

A - Chris Caton{BIO 20098244 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, I think you will see in the Mexico, we are seeing it. But I don't think you see reassuring here. What was the first part of your question? What was the others -- right, right.

Q - Jamie Feldman{BIO 20107893 <GO>}
Oh. I have an no deal.

A - Hamid R. Moghadam{BIO 1739296 <GO>}
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we'll find out in a couple weeks. But the -- I can tell you that -- and you've heard the stock about this for years now, we've really taken the customer and put it in the middle of our business, and that is paying dividend. So this customer-centric model allows us to do a lot of business, by the way that playbook will get copied like everything else. So, I assume other people do the same thing. But so far we're doing great with major customer business, thanks to the good work that the teams are doing.

With that, Jamie, you were the last. So thank you again for your attention and we look forward to talking to you before next quarter for sure. Take care.
