I'll kick off with Google Services performance in the first quarter, then provide color into our key opportunity areas, and then turn it over to Ruth for more on our financial performance. Google Services revenue of $62 billion were up 1% year-on-year, including the effect of the modest foreign exchange headwind. In Google Advertising, Search and other, revenues grew 2% year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the travel and retail verticals, offset partially by a decline in finance as well as in media and entertainment.",

Google other revenues were up 9% year-over-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues. Now let's double click into the three areas I laid out last quarter, where we see clear opportunities for long-term growth in advertising; number one, Google AI; number two, Retail, which cuts across all of our ads, products and services; and number three, YouTube. First, Google AI. As said before, AI has long been an important driver of our business. Advancements are powering our ability to help businesses, big and small, respond in real time to rapidly changing market and consumer shifts and deliver measurable ROI when it's needed most. In Q1, we continued to innovate across our products. Take core Search for example. In Targeting, we updated search keyword relevance using the latest natural language AI from MUM models to improve the relevance and performance of shown ads when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible for an auction. In Bidding, we improved our Smart Bidding models to bid more accurately based on differences in Search ad formats.",

    "speaker": "Philipp Schindler",
    "text": "In other words, bid more effectively depending on how a user wants to engage with an ad. In Creatives, we opened our automatically created assets beta to all advertisers in English. ACA generates text assets alongside your responsive Search ads and uses AI to help reduce the amount of manual work to keep Creatives fresh and relevant to users' query, context, and to the advertiser's business. To then unlock core Search further and maximize conversions across all of Google, we're actively helping more advertisers pair it together with Performance Max. Advertisers who use PMax are, on average, achieving over 18% more conversions at a similar CPA. This is up 5 points in just 14 months, thanks to advances in the AI underlying Bidding, Creatives, search query matching, and new formats like YouTube Shorts. I mentioned earlier that travel was a contributor to growth. In March, we launched PMax for travel goals. Now, even the smallest hoteliers can benefit from the expanded reach of hotel ads in PMax. Like family-run Corissia Hotels Group, who drove a 32% increase in revenue and a 26% increase in total direct bookings within just one month of using PMax for travel goals. There's more to come here as we add even more AI-powered features. Stay tuned for more at Google Marketing Live in May. Moving on to retail, where we had a solid quarter. Our focus is on three pillars. Number one, making Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users. Number two, empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ads experiences. And number three, driving retail performance further with great ads products. In a macro environment of do more with less, our tools and solutions are proving that we can deliver value for retailers, online and omnichannel, and drive high-value customers even in challenging times. Caraway, a direct-to-consumer maker of cookware, used target ROAS to uncap budgets and PMax to optimize and deploy spend across Google inventory for its Q4 Black Friday campaign. PMax drove a 46% increase in revenue and 31% jump in ROAS, leading to Caraway's best business day in history, and a robust reinvestment in its AI-first strategy for Q1. For omni-focused retailers, we recently rolled out store sales reporting and bidding and Performance Max for store goals. This is helping retailers go beyond just optimizing to online conversions, to also optimize to their stores, reaching and bidding for high-value customers who are more likely to spend in-store. Danish department store, Magasin, recently used our store sales solution to boost its omnichannel ROAS a 128% versus online-only campaigns. Thanks to dynamic in-store values coming from its first-party data, including its high-value customers, Magasin can now, with confidence, measure the full impact of its online investments on both e-commerce and physical store revenue. Turning to YouTube. Creators fuel YouTube's success. Across long-form and Shorts, music and podcasts, vertical and horizontal, YouTube is where creators are incentivized to make their best work, which means the best content, more viewers and more opportunities for advertisers. As I said last quarter, our creator ecosystem and multi-format strategy will be key drivers of YouTube's long-term growth. And to support this growth, we're focused on number one, Shorts; number two, engagement on CTV; number three, investing in our subscription offerings; and number four, a longer-term effort to make YouTube more shoppable. First, Shorts. We're seeing strong watch time growth. Monetization is also progressing nicely. People are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates. Number two, Connected TV. As Sundar said, we're seeing momentum globally. Viewers love watching YouTube creators and their favorite content on the large screen. Advertisers are leaning in. Zooming out more broadly for a second. Across YouTube, we're helping brands benefit from our expansive reach and drive the profitability they're looking for. In one of our largest marketing mix modeling studies to-date, YouTube ROI is 40% higher than linear TV, and 34% higher than all other online video according to a custom analysis from January 2020 to March 2022 of Nielsen-Compass ROI benchmarks across 16 countries and $19 billion of total media spend measured. This proves YouTube's ability to drive effectiveness at scale. Next up, are our subscription offerings. The goal is to be a one-stop shop for multiple types of video content across both ad-supported and premium services. Our launch of Multiview on YouTube TV and our first-of-its-kind ala carte access for NFL Sunday Ticket are two examples of how we're investing here. Expect more updates over the coming quarters. Number four, shopping on YouTube. It's still super early days. One highlight, last year, we brought shopping to more creators and brands by partnering with commerce platforms like Shopify. Now, more than 100,000 creators, artists and brands have connected their own stores to their YouTube channels to sell their products. We're excited about the potential ahead. I'll close with an awesome example of how we're bringing the best across Google to our partners to accelerate innovation. Mercedes-Benz. In February, we announced a first-of-a-kind partnership to bring Google Maps platform and YouTube into future Mercedes-Benz vehicles equipped with its next-gen MB.OS operating system. Beyond enabling the luxury automaker to design a customized navigation interface, we'll also provide AI and data cloud capabilities to advance their autonomous driving efforts and create an enhanced customer experience. On that note, a big thank you, first, to our customers and partners for their trust and collaboration; and second, to our Googlers, for all of their incredible work this quarter. Ruth, over to you.",

The main area maybe I'm excited by is we do know from experience that users come back to search, they follow on, they're engaging back on stuff they already did. And so, for us to use LLMs in a way we can serve those use cases better, I think it's a real opportunity. Obviously, if it's YouTube, the chance to really improve experiences for creators and consumers in terms of how the videos are viewed, et cetera, I think you can expect changes. Workspace, we already have changes rolling out, and it's an area where I think, we'll see the biggest advances because I think, productivity is a strong use case in which generative AI can help. And obviously on Cloud, this has been an important moment as pretty much every organization is thinking about how to use AI to drive transformation.

I do think, first of all, on -- we'll be rolling it out in an incremental way so that we can test, iterate, and innovate. So I think we'll approach it that way. I think overall, I think it can apply to a broad range of queries. So I think I'm excited that it can allow us to better help users in a category of queries, maybe in which there was no right answer and they're more creative, et cetera. So I think those are opportunities. But even in our existing query categories, where we get a chance to do some heavy lifting for the users and use AI to better give guide and -- guide them, I think you will see us exploring in those directions as well. It's early days, but I think there's a lot of innovation to come. On the cost side, we've always -- costs of compute has always been a consideration for us. And if anything, I think it's something we've developed extensive experience over many, many years. And so, for us, it's a nature of habit to constantly drive efficiencies in hardware, software and models across our fleet. And so, this is not new. If anything, the sharper the technology curve is, we get excited by it because I think we have built world-class capabilities in taking that and then driving down cost sequentially and then deploying it at scale across the world.

We're pleased with our continuing progress and monetization. As I said earlier, people are engaging and converting on ads across shorts at increasing rates. Closing the gap between Shorts and long form is a top priority for us as is continuing to build a greater creator and user experience. Ads on Shorts are now available via video action app, Discovery and Performance Max campaigns and via product feeds. Shorts are also shoppable. Again, we're the only destination where creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats and screens with multiple ways to make a living. And as Sundar said last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%, and then in February, we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube partner program. Our sustainable revenue sharing model at scale remains pretty unique in the industry and we continue to see a strong creator adoption.

The fundamental drivers here are people are looking for relevant information and in commercial categories, they find ads to be highly relevant and valuable.

We care about sending traffic, advertisers want to reach users. And so, all those dynamics, I think, which have long served us well, remain. And as I said, we'll be iterating and testing as we grow.

So excluding the impact of FX performance was actually similar to last quarter. The ongoing performance of Search, notwithstanding the headwinds, reflects really search resilience with the, I'd say, ability of search to surface demand and deliver measurable ROI in an uncertain environment. I called out the key verticals in the quarter. There's really no additional color on other verticals, I'd say, maybe more broadly, what we saw reflects what's being reported elsewhere and across the headlines, many companies are very focused on shorter-term profitability amidst this uncertainty and some pullback as budgets as well.",

I've taught at length on prior calls about omni-channel or local and omni-channel solutions are helping bridge the gap here between online and offline by using AI to reach nearby shoppers, promote local inventory, fulfillment options, optimize in-store visits and sales, for example. And then to help really retain loyal customers and acquiring new ones, we have YouTube app deep linking, and new customer acquisition goals and PMax are helping here. Making checkouts easy with tools like virtual cards on Chrome is obviously important. So those are just some of the key points. Overall, we're giving retailers really the best, I hope, AI-powered tools and solutions to maximize reach and ROI and really create a seamless experience, including, where possible, on the payment side for their customers. And this will continue to be our focus here.",
