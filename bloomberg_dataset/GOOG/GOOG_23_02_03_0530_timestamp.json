In terms of Other Bets, as Sundar mentioned, we will be making a financial reporting change as it relates to DeepMind. To reflect the increasing DeepMind collaboration with Google services, Google Cloud and Other Bets, beginning in the first quarter, DeepMind will no longer be reported in Other Bets and will be reported as part of Alphabet's corporate costs.",

We expect the impact will become more visible in twenty twenty four. First, with respect to Alphabet headcount, we are meaningfully slowing the pace of hiring in twenty twenty three while still investing in priority areas. In Q4, we added three thousand four hundred and fifty five people. As in prior quarters, the majority of hires were for technical roles.",

We will take a severance charge of one point nine billion to two point three billion dollars which will be reported in corporate costs. We will continue hiring in priority areas with a particular focus on top engineering and technical talent as well as on the global footprint of our talent. Second, we have a longer term effort underway to reengineer our cost base in three broad categories. First, using AI and automation to improve productivity across Alphabet for operational tasks as well as the efficiency of our technical infrastructure.",

In the first quarter of twenty twenty three, we expect to incur approximately five hundred million dollars of costs related to exiting leases to align our office space with our adjusted global headcount look. This will be reflected in corporate costs. We will continue to optimize our real estate footprint. Turning to CapEx for twenty twenty three, we expect total CapEx to be generally in line with twenty twenty two with an increase in technical infrastructure versus a decline in office facilities.",

So we do see secular opportunities ahead, both in terms of putting these APIs out, making sure every developer, every organization in the world can use it.
