Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Welcome to the Texas Instruments Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and you'll be able to get it via replay on our website.

This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.

Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into third-quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our customers and markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the results and our guidance for the fourth-quarter of 2022.

Starting with a quick overview of the third quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $5.2 billion, an increase of 1% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Analog revenue grew 13%, Embedded Processing grew 11% and our other segment grew 20% from the year-ago quarter.

Now, I'll provide some insight into the third-quarter revenue by market. This quarter, our focus on our sequential performance as it's more informative at this time. First, personal electronics declined mid-teens as we continue to see the weakness we described in the second-quarter. Industrial was about even sequentially as we saw weakness begin to broaden in the industrial market. The automotive market remains strong and was about 10%. Next communications equipment was up high-single-digits and finally, enterprise systems was up mid single-digits.

Turning to our expectations for the fourth, we expect that most of our end-markets will decline sequentially with the exception of the automotive market. Lastly, we and our customers remain pleased with the progress of our expansion of our manufacturing capacity, which was outlined in our February Capital Management and will support the long-term secular trend of increased semiconductor content per system. Customers especially value the geopolitically dependable footprint of our manufacturing additions. We are now in production in our RFAB2 and expect production in LFAB later this year. In addition, construction of SM1 and SM2 in Sherman, Texas continues this plant.

Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.

Rafael R. Lizardi{BIO 20006334 <GO>}
Thanks, Dave. And good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, third-quarter revenue was $5.2 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.6 billion or 69% of revenue. From a year-ago gross profit margin increased 110 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $852 million, up 8% from a year-ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis operating expenses were $3.3 billion or 16% of revenue. Restructuring charges were $77 million in the third-quarter and are associated with the LFAB factory that we purchased in October of last year. These charges will move to cost of revenue as we start production, the assets associated with the acquisition of the factory will begin to depreciate at the same time.

Moving on operating profit was $2.7 billion in the quarter or 51% of revenue. Operating, profit was up 16% from the year-ago quarter. Coming to the third-quarter was $2.3 billion or $2.47 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.02 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance.

Let me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash-flow from operations was $2.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $790 million in the quarter and $3.1 billion over the last 12 months. Free-cash flow-on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $1 billion of our stock. In total we have returned $7.1 billion in the past 12 months. In September we announced we will increase our dividend by 8%, mark in our 19th consecutive year of dividend increases.

We also increased our share repurchase authorization by $15 billion, these actions reflect our commitment to return our free-cash-flow to our owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end-of-the third-quarter. In the quarter we issued $700 million in debt, total debt outstanding was $8 billion, with a weighted-average coupon of 2.8%. Inventory dollars were up $205 million from the prior quarter to $2.4 billion and days were 133 up eight days sequentially and below desired levels.

For the fourth-quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.83 to $2.01. This outlook comprehends the market conditions that Dave had previously mentioned.

We continue to expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be about 14%. As, you are looking at your models for 2023 without additional changes to tax law we would expect our effective tax-rate to remain above what it is in 2022, we've have similar quarterly profile. Let me now make a few comments on the Chips Act that was recently signed into law. The combination of the investment tax credit, the grant as well as funding for research and development will help make the US semiconductor industry more competitive. We accrued about $50 million on the balance sheet in third-quarter due to the 25% investment tax credit for investments in our U.S. factories. This will eventually flow out of statement as lower depreciation. And we will receive the associated cash benefit in the future. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, breach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free-cash growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.

Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask the question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you sir. (Operator Instructions). We will take the first question from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open. Please go-ahead.

Q - Timothy Arcuri{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Hi. Thanks. Dave, I wonder if you can sort of go into any detail within distribution versus consignment. Maybe, you know, what I'm trying to get at is sort of any differences in demand pull as measured by bookings, inside distribution or demand pull from the consignment segment, is one better than the other and if there -- and also is there any cancellations inside of into distribution?

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Yeah. So on the first part, Tim we didn't see really any -- anything different between the direct business that going through distribution. As you know, we have had an effort to -- over the past few years to have direct -- closer direct relationships with our customers to the amount of revenue going through distribution as much lower today. So probably only about 30% of our revenue actually goes through distribution.

We did see cancellations, an increase in the quarters just as customers worked to align the backlog to their needs. Do you have a follow-up?

Operator
(inaudible) Sir. So we will take the next question from Vivek Arya, Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Please go-ahead.

Q - Vivek Arya{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question. Sir, the first one, it seems like the consumer electronics is your biggest area of headwinds in Q3. I think you said down mid-teens. May I imagine about the same kind of double-digit down in Q4. You think are we past the worst of the consumer or should we be expecting the seasonal decline again for consumer in Q1? I know it's a little bit further out, but I just wanted to check what you're seeing in terms of consumer right now. And I guess a bigger-picture question there is, is TI more exposed to the cyclical downturn versus your peers because you have the highest consumer exposure and if that is the case, do you need to do something different given that mix headwind?

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Yeah. Vivek, thanks for that question and the opportunity to clarify. So personal electronics, last year was 24% of our revenue, if you look at the market overall, personal electronics a little more than 50% of the semiconductor market without memory. So we have less than half of the exposure there. If you look at industrial and automotive that makes up 62% of our revenues and inside of the market that's 26% of the market. So we're really highly exposed to both industrial and automotive. And that's not by accident, as you know, probably more than a decade ago we began allocating more of our resources to automotive and industrial and the emphasis there. So we're very pleased with our exposure.

And we believe that, that will be were -- there just will be more content added into those systems. Now that said, there's great opportunities inside of personal electronics, communications equipment and enterprise systems in the decades ahead. But we'll just have those secular tailwinds more than average inside of industrial and automotive. Do you have follow-on, Vivek?

Q - Vivek Arya{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Yeah. Thank you, Dave. So kind of similar question, but on automotive, which you suggested grew 10% sequential in Q3 and interestingly, you're suggesting it can grow again in Q4. What's your sense of kind of the supply demand balance in automotive among your Tier-1 and then the Auto OEM customers? Many investors are concerned that just kind of rolling correction that we are seeing in semi is going to eventually hit automotive, which has been a very strong area over the last one to two years. So what's your sense of what kind of the supply demand balances in the automotive end-market? Thank you.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Yeah, I'd say first, I think when you look at the secular trends inside of automotive, I think all of us know that it will be a great grower for us, and we're investing very broadly. So, we're just thrilled with the position. If you look at the second-quarter of 2020, our growth there has off the bottom done, very, very strong. will that market eventually rollover? It will. I mean, that's just what happens and, we're not trying to predict when that will happen, we'll continue to ship product to customers as they request it. And we're really focused on making sure we've got capacity in-place for them over the long-term. So we're not really trying to worry about when that will happen. So thank you Vivek. And, we'll go to the next caller. Please.

Operator
Next question from Joshua Buchalter from Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Joshua Buchalter{BIO 19890074 <GO>}
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to double-click on the industrial market. Did anything change materially through the quarter or anything you give us some linearity or by geography as we think about what's baked into the guide, is it more, I guess, conservatism on the macro or was there a really a material change in your customers' order patterns? Thank you.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Yeah. Josh, well, thanks for that question. I would say if you look at third-quarter result across the board and also inclusive of industrial the quarter came in as we expected, if you look at an even sequential is not unusual inside of industrial, that's up about what we were expecting. But as we described at the weakness began to broadened into that. So there wasn't one place that we could put the finger on to say it was one thing or one group of customers but we did see just different signals inside of their, that is leading us to that conclusion, that it is that weakness is broadening. And in fact, we expect that weakness to broaden into most of the other markets as well as we move into fourth-quarter, of course, with the exception of auto.

So that's really what we're seeing -- it's order rates, if you look at order rates, quarter-to-date, they are of course consistent with our outlook but they are weak quarter-to-date and so it's those types of signals that are leading to the outlook. And, really those are the types of signals that really best inform what our shipments in the quarter and in the short-term are going to be. Do you have a follow-up, Joshua?

Q - Joshua Buchalter{BIO 19890074 <GO>}
Yes, thank you. That's very helpful. I just want to clarify the comments on the Chips Act. You mentioned of $50 million was accrued on the balance sheet. Was that from the investment tax credit only, because we know there is a second bucket for manufacturing incentives. And if not, when would you expect take I guess get more clarity on how much you'll be able to accrue for the manufacturing incentive portion of the Chips Act? Thank you.

A - Rafael R. Lizardi{BIO 20006334 <GO>}
Yeah. So first let me step-back, big-picture the combination of the investment tax-rate, the grant as well as the funding for research and development will help -- U.S. semiconductor are more competitive. We accrued the $50 million that we talked about in the prepared remarks that you referred to that was for the 0.25% investment tax credit, that is for manufacturing assets, that will go into service in 2023 and beyond. And that if sells for $200 million, so a quarter of that is what we accrued that we will receive from the government at some point in the future as lower taxes, but in the P&L it flows -- it will flow through a lower depreciation. I think maybe what you're referring to when you talk about manufacturing the grant portion is that what you're referring to?

Well, maybe will (inaudible) if you were talking about the grant that is part of chips act but its separate from the investment tax credit that remains to be seen as (inaudible) we will apply for those that application windows are open until February, so we will apply for those as we learn more, we'll let you know and big-picture in -- when we get to February the next capital management call, we will talk about the Chips Act, the overall investment, we'll try to quantify that and what benefit we'll get at the same time since the last capital management call, our confidence around the long-term growth prospects in our industry, the secular trends that Dave talked about earlier that confidence has only grown so we feel really good about that so we'll tell you about the net impact between those two the benefits of the Chips Act and the growing confidence at the next capital management call and then any changes to our numbers based on that.

Q - Joshua Buchalter{BIO 19890074 <GO>}
Great. Thanks (Multiple Speakers)

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
So, I think you dropped out (Multiple Speakers)

Q - Joshua Buchalter{BIO 19890074 <GO>}
Yeah

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Thank you, we'll go to the next caller please.

Operator
We will take a follow-up question from Timothy Arcuri, UBS. Your line is open. Please go-ahead.

Q - Timothy Arcuri{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Thanks a lot, Dave for a -- let me come back in so my follow-up was on China and, I'm wondering if you can talk about your business there are you seeing any signs of pull-ins or push-outs as a result of some of these bands? Are you seeing any changes sort of linearity around the bands getting announced? And I think also you talked about China being like high-teens of consumption of your product is that still where you see it? Thanks.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
So, and Rafael maybe you want to add to it but on the bands, that's the recent changes in some of the bands. There were companies added to the entities list overall. We don't expect that -- there's really much if any impact, due to those changes really to that or in any of the restrictions from overall from that. Anything to add-on that?

A - Rafael R. Lizardi{BIO 20006334 <GO>}
Yeah, correct 99% of our borrowers fall, under very lowest category of restrictions just given the nature of the types of parts that we sell. So we don't have restrictions, and those of course there're restrictions specific to entities. There is -- the entity list that you hear about the FDPR, that's another list and we of course follow all the regulations when it comes to that.

So when an entity goes listed in there we take that into account and restrict shipments as according to the law but given how that works we, don't expect any meaningful or significant impact to our revenue with those export loss.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
And that was the first part of your question Tim, the second part, you had mentioned high-teens. It's actually about 25% of our revenue comes from customers that are based in China. So that's the number. So thank you, Tim and we'll go to the next caller please.

Operator
Next one from Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research. Your line is open, please go-ahead.

Q - Stacy Rasgon{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Hi, guys thanks for taking my questions. So my first one, I just wanted to verify, are there any changes to the trajectory of the near-to-medium term CapEx plan just given changes in the current environment? And I guess related to that, the Lehigh headwinds that are coming do you have any of those embedded in Q4 because you said it's coming online starting in Q4 and I'm getting implied gross margins down a few 100 basis-points sequentially?

A - Rafael R. Lizardi{BIO 20006334 <GO>}
Yeah, so let me answer the first one -- the last one first. So you see on our P&L about $77 million of restructuring charges in third-quarter that is all because of-- that is sort of Lehigh cost that we chosen to put in there before it qualifies. Once it qualifies that cost will move to cost of revenue, so, it will move to gross margin

Q - Stacy Rasgon{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Is that in Q4 though, does it happen in Q1?

A - Rafael R. Lizardi{BIO 20006334 <GO>}
Q1 (Multiple Speakers) Well, it will happen during Q4, of course, is not changing in total effect EPS so it's just going to move and we don't guide the specific lines, right? But if it qualifies annual December 1st or 3rd of that will go into COR and then all of, it will be there for first-quarter right? If you qualify December 31st, then all of, it will be in restructuring in fourth-quarter and then all of it will move in first-quarter.Right.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Yeah and just to clarify that's already in (Multiple Speakers) operating profit and great quarter it's been there it's just moving above the lines in (Multiple Speakers)

A - Rafael R. Lizardi{BIO 20006334 <GO>}
Right, into gross profit (Multiple Speakers) it's been in profit operations the entire time all of this year. The first part of your question big-picture. We will give you an update in about four months that the capital management with all the puts and takes but what I would tell you is that -- well short-term we expect -- our change our CapEx expectation for 2022 have not changed that is $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion for this year, depreciation about $1 billion for this year, I'm talking 2022.

Bigger-picture as, I said earlier, the Chips Act great legislation we're very excited about that, that is going to decrease on a net basis, our investment because we're going to get 25% reduction from the investments that qualify the manufacturing investments in the United States.

But on the other hand as I alluded to earlier our confidence surrounding our long-term growth prospects have only grown over the last six to 12 months based on the secular trends, based on input from our customers so we feel really excited about that. The net effect of those two and whatever that does to our CapEx plans we will tell you about that in February.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Do you have follow on Stacy?

Q - Stacy Rasgon{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
I do thank you. I wanted to ask about OpEx. So it's been running in, $800 million range, plus or minus for quite a while and frankly, people wondering how you've been keeping it there in such an inflationary environment, it is now ticking up. but it's ticking up as revenues are falling.

I guess why is increasing now whereas it didn't increase before and what happens going forward because if I would just hold it flat on the revenue guidance going forward to do something like 19% of revenue but it's still below your kind of what you've talked about in terms of long-term targets for OpEx? So how do we, think about that? Why is it growing now versus before? And how do we, think about where the range might go going-forward?

A - Rafael R. Lizardi{BIO 20006334 <GO>}
Yeah. So, here's how we, think about it, step-back for the last five and half years, really we've been running OpEx on a trailing 12-month basis, which is how I prefer to, look at it at $3.2 million, pretty consistently we're really steady hand over that time. Our hiring has been very consistent during that time and that is underpinned by our long-term expectations on growth and inside of that R&D has actually moved up, SG&A has moved down instead of that $3.2 but it's been really consistent on that.

This last quarter for first time it ticked up to $3.3 billion on a trailing 12-month basis and I would expect that to continue to ticking up over the next many quarters and years as we continue, stepping up our investments and that is A; driven by the higher investments but B: inflation is playing a factor is clearly wage inflation we're not immune to that so that is also affecting and will continue to affect those trends.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks, Stacy. We'll move to next caller. Thank you.

Operator
We have Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open, please go-ahead.

Q - Blayne Curtis{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
Hey, guys thanks for taking my question, maybe just a clarification though on Stacy's question because you said but I didn't hear anything negative to net off of two positive I'm just kind of curious and I guess, we'll see what March brings and I'm happy if you want to comment on that but, it seems like at least personal electronics is back to where you were in 1920, it seems like industrial kind of get back there and at that point you're building inventories, you had more capacity than demand so if we do go back to those levels and you're adding more capacity I'm just trying to understand is still the view that you will build inventory like you did '19 and '20 and still roll out this capacity for the long-term?

A - Rafael R. Lizardi{BIO 20006334 <GO>}
Let me try to answer that frankly, I didn't fully understand. You throw in several parameters there but let me just address that the best way I can in levels and capacity. So capacity, we've been adding capacity incrementally for a number of quarters, now RFAB2 is in-production, Lehigh is about to start production within a few months, so clearly our increments -- incremental capacity, is going up. At the same time, we've been increasing inventory very slowly and now more recently we added $200 million of inventory in this last quarter. But we are still below desired levels. Dave, keep in mind our business model is thoughts where we are target the vast majority parts sell to many-many customers. So they're very broad in nature. The product life cycles of the parts is decades in many times. The products themselves last 10 years in inventory most of them. So the risk of (inaudible) for the inventory is very-very low. The potential offset of having that inventory ready is very high.

So that's why we prefer to have more than less inventory so, I would not be uncomfortable as I've said before, adding another one $1 billion, $1.5 billion dollars of inventory over the next several quarters to get us well-positioned for the next upturn that invariably comes at some point.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Do you have follow-on Blayne?

Q - Blayne Curtis{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
Thanks and I just want to ask you specifically on the auto segment you said that's the only one that's not down and obviously, it's very well known that it's been so tight. But just anymore comments on why that market is taking a bit longer than say industrial to correct?

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Yeah. I think, it's well documented. I think as we went through the pandemic has had the deepest correction from a starting point standpoint. The mix of auto manufacturers to the high-end, you've got EVs that -- that are inside of those mix that are all adding to that to those secular trends. So I think that we're well-positioned. As we make investments across our businesses, we're investing in powertrain, which would include electric vehicles and hybrid, we're investing in ADAS systems, we're investing in infotainment systems, we're investing in body and lighting. That doesn't get talked about a lot on conference calls. We get as excited about turn signals as we do about BMS systems. And then we also invest in safety system.

So we're growing very broadly, we've got close to a 1,000 different automotive OEMs that we service. And we really believe that we've got probably decades of growth ahead of us that we're preparing for. So thank you, Blaine. We will go to the next caller please.

Operator
We have Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Ross Seymore{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. If a high-level one on your analog business, year-to-date I think it's 15% year-over-year with the midpoint-ish of your guidance. It seems like this year might be up about 10%. That's roughly half of what the broader market is running at. Can you guys explain a little bit about why you would be under growing the market as defined by SIA? And if you are is that something that you expect to mean revert because you don't give --lose this amount of share in a year unless there's something unique going on? So any help on explaining that would be great.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Yeah, sure. I think that, whenever I'm asked that question and it's always a lot more comfortable to be at answering it when we're up twice the rate of the market. They really need to look at it over a longer period of time. So look at the rate of growth of us versus the industry from fourth quarter of '19, I just picked that because it's a pre-pandemic number and -- and we look very good against those numbers.

So we were as you remember, as we went into the pandemic we continued to build inventory. So the numbers initially looked very, very strong, as customers pulled product from us. So when you look some of the sequentials were harder and that's not making excuses but when you look at our manufacturing footprint and how we're positioned, you look at the customer excitement around that -- that manufacturing footprint. You and customers look at where that addition is coming and the geopolitical dependable locations of where that footprint's coming on. We are very confident in where the trajectory of our market-share is going longer-term.

So you got a follow-up for us?

Q - Ross Seymore{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
I do. I just wanted to revisit the gross margin side, not going into whether the Lehigh charges are moving into COGS or not, but are there any other moving parts because it appears at the midpoint of your revenue guide and your earnings guide of OpEx is roughly the same, sequentially that the gross margin would have to go down the better part of two or three points. I just wanted to know if there's any other unique aspects implied in that guidance?

A - Rafael R. Lizardi{BIO 20006334 <GO>}
Yeah. No well, I would tell you we're very pleased with our gross margin performance on a year-on year basis, the third-quarter that we just finished the fall-through was 4% and that is actually higher than the guidance that we've given (inaudible). What I would point you to is as you can see in the cash-flow statement, depreciation, I think it increase sequentially, has increased sequentially actually for a number of quarters, but this last quarter $27 million of course, that is a direct result of the CapEx investments that we're making.

And so you should expect depreciation to continue sticking up by said earlier in the call, we expect this year to be close to a $1 billion. So you can obviously then do the math and get fourth-quarter depreciation there, but clearly that is picking-up and the bulk of that depreciation goes into cost of revenue.

Q - Ross Seymore{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Thank you.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you, Ross. Now will go to the next caller please.

Operator
Next one is Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go-ahead.

Q - Joe Moore{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Yes, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about if the lead-time environment has changed. I know you've talked about there being hotspots in the past few quarters, has that gone now and your delinquencies kind of back to below normal levels or where are you at with that?

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Yeah. So we still do have -- still do have hotspots in any market environment we've got hotspots, but we still do have them probably still most pronounced in inside of automotive. Lead times didn't change much second-quarter to third-quarter. And at the same time, as we've talked about before customers can get immediate availability of products on TI.com. So they have kind of all those -- all those dynamics going on. Do you have follow-up, Joe?

Q - Joe Moore{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Yeah. Thank you for that. We're hearing from some of your industrial and automotive customers a desire to hold higher safety stock. Then what companies have historically held, is that something that you guys see is that, I mean, do you think might affect TI and just how do you think about that, going-forward? Do you think that's a normal state of affairs?

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Yeah. We've seen and heard and been in those discussions, before we know that some customers that are really taking a hard look at their supply chains where, their product is coming from, what technologies they're being built on, ensuring that they've got supply of those technologies. The part of the reason why, when they look at product being built and the capacity we're putting in-place at 45 nanometer to 130 nanometer, they know they need that capacity for decades to come. So they get excited about when they see that capacity overall. But the change of supply -- the supply chains is really hard work. It will take a long-time to be able to do its not oftentimes just as simple is carrying more inventory on the balance sheet.

So you know, there probably will be some of those customers that do that hard work and restructure the supply chains. And there probably will be some that once we get supply and demand imbalance, just kind of fall back into normal practices. So I think time will tell as that plays out. Rafael?

A - Rafael R. Lizardi{BIO 20006334 <GO>}
Yeah. I'll just add. At the end of the day customers will do what they want to do, right? And of course, if they want to hold more inventory there, they are welcome to do that. What we believe is that for us to hold more inventory we're in a great position to do that given the nature of that inventory that is catalog in nature, that can sell to many, many customers. So they will better off and our customers will be better off when we hold more of that inventory and we can direct it where it's most needed.

So that's why as I said earlier, we -- our goal is to continue growing inventory, we still below desired levels, and we will add a significantly more inventory over the quarters to come. Be ready for the next upside.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
All right. Thank you, Joe. We will go to the next caller please.

Operator
William Stein from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - William Stein{BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about TI.com. In past quarters, I think maybe even a quarter ago, you talked about how percent of revenue from that channel had gone from less than 1% of sales to over 10%. I think that occurred in about a one year timeframe. You just mentioned a moment ago, Dave that this is the channel where customers can go for nearly immediate availability. So I would assume that they get that availability at a price and that when things start softening as you're alluding to you on this call, that perhaps that channel sees a more precipitous decline. Did we see that during the quarter and do you anticipate that's happening coming quarter too?

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Yeah. And we did see a decline there. And we'll finish up the year and provide an update on our capital management how it did for the year won't be something that we'll be reporting out on a quarterly basis. But there was a decline there and not that it was unexpected, so. Now longer-term it's a fantastic channel to engage customers on a number of levels and customers are very pleased. So there'll be fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, maybe even year-to-year, but over the long-term is we're very pleased with that channel and what it's doing to get even more directly engage with customers absolutely.

Do you have follow on Will?

Q - William Stein{BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Yeah, sort of along the same lines, there has been some speculation in the press for example that this has been a channel for companies that you might call brokers or some people call, the gray market and distribution to get their hands on TI product and that perhaps there is still inventory that was acquired by such parties that is still sort of floating around and waiting to be sold on to end customers. I wonder whether you've found a better reason to maybe track that and measure it and any observations you've made with regard to that? Thank you.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Yeah. And well, as you know, I spent eight years of my career in sales and there have always been brokers in our market. And as Rafael talked about, we've long believed that owning and controlling our inventory is a strategic advantage. And having policies of like non-cancellable orders and things like that as customers take product that they don't need, that's typically the source of that product going out the back -- the back door for brokers. So can brokers go onto TI.com, and get product? They can. But that's pretty minimal in comparison to other sources that they might be able to get it.

So overall, the majority of customers that we service -- our customers that we have large engagements with directly.

Thank you. And we'll go to the next caller please.

Operator
We'll take CJ Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go-ahead.

Q - C.J. Muse
Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, a question on end-markets into December. If I adjust down 12% sequential for the strength in auto. It looks like all your other businesses is attracting at least down kind of mid-teens. So curious, what parts of the market are down seasonally. I would think the other the calculators would be one and what's maybe more down (inaudible) in terms of the correction that you're seeing.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
And C.J, just to clarify you're talking about the fourth-quarter guidance?

Q - C.J. Muse
Yeah, yeah. Thanks, Dave.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Yeah. So again, we're not trying to provide guidance by quarter or by each market inside of that. We aren't obviously with the guide overall. It is a weaker fourth-quarter than a typical fourth-quarter. So with the exception of auto as we've talked about that, we will continue to see weakness inside of personal electronics, but we will see the other markets weaken as well. So we're not trying to get specific on that. So we'll finish up the quarter and report that out. But we do expect the weakness to broaden across those markets. Do you have follow-on?

Q - C.J. Muse
Yes, please. I guess, as a follow-on -- a follow-on question to China and obviously, you talked about very little impact from the embargo on new business, but curious, as you contemplate China's ability to invest in the lagging edge, I'm assuming it will take years if not decades to try to compete in high-performance analog. But just curious how your thoughts are evolving for China as a competitor to you in the coming decades?

A - Rafael R. Lizardi{BIO 20006334 <GO>}
Yeah. I'll start and Dave you want to chime in. But, I would tell you at the end-of-the day it all comes down to our competitor advantages right? And it starts with the broad portfolio that we have in analog and embedded space, you need a huge portfolio to compete effectively particularly in industrial and automotive. And we have 80,000 or so parts that we sell to a 100,000 different customers. So you need that type of diversity.

Then, second is manufacturing and technology. This investments that are position in 300 millimeter first, but then all the investments that we're making are just building on that. I fell we have RFAB2 come in that just came online, our new factory in Lehigh and the mega site that we just broke ground in Sherman, that's going to have four factories, each one the size of RFAB2. So that really puts us in a very strong position to compete against anyone whether is in the United States or in China.

Q - C.J. Muse
Okay. Thank you.

A - Dave Pahl{BIO 18870833 <GO>}
Thank you, C.J. With that, we'll wrap it up. And Rafael?

A - Rafael R. Lizardi{BIO 20006334 <GO>}
Yeah. So let me wrap it up. Our core we're engineers and technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free-cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we'll continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners, who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever-changing, and we will be a company that we're personally proud to be a part of and would one as our neighbor. When we're successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening.
