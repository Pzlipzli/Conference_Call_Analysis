Questions And Answers
Operator
Okay. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is open.

Q - Ross Sandler{BIO 15948659 <GO>}
Hey, guys. What's happening? Two questions. Tony, your non-restaurant delivery business has several strategies in place, both in marketplace and in Drive. What are you most excited about thus far. What's adding the most to your financial performance?

And second question is, in the letter you mentioned that same-store sales for your merchants is up about 35%. I assume that's dramatically higher than anybody in the pure set. But if overall GOV starts to decelerate and normalize next year, how does that work as far as continuing to add merchants while growing same-store sales and any thought on how you balance out that? And what that might mean for merchant retention? Thanks, a lot guys. Nice quarter.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Great. Hey, Ross. I'll take the first question. I'll let Prabir start the second. So, on the first question with respect to new categories you mean you're right. We're super excited about our progress, in Q1 we announced that about 7% of our business was coming from orders outside of restaurants and that has grown sequentially, and it's growing certainly faster than our restaurants business. And it does touch upon the strategy of creating both a marketplace, where we're generating incremental demand and really building best in class point solutions, category-by-category, where we bring everything inside the neighborhood to consumers and minutes, not hours or days.

And then on the other side, we are also building a first-party capability on behalf of retailers and merchants, so that they can create their own digital businesses. The goal of DoorDash has always been to create the largest local commerce marketplace as well as the largest local commerce platform and we think that this strategy is certainly playing out, not just in our core and original category of restaurants. But now also heading into other categories.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
And Ross, just to add on to Tony's point. I mean, the reason we're excited about these new categories, both in our marketplace and depending[ph] on the marketplace in addition to Drive is, what the early data suggest is that when consumers buy from other categories in our marketplace in addition to the food category, they subsequently now then increase their retention and engagement with the marketplace as a whole compared to customers who did not buy across categories.

And so we're seeing those behaviour, it's super exciting, it's improving the value proposition of DashPass which is why we're investing behind it, both on the marketplace as well as for Drive. Now, for Drive it's a slightly different strategy, because we don't own the customer in each of the Drive. But as we add more orders from other categories to the ecosystem, we're just creating no density -- an order density that frankly lowers our cost structure and then the rest of the flywheels. So that's on your -- the first part of your question.

On the second question, I think I understand what you are getting at, but the way I view it is first, if you think from a merchant standpoint, the marketplace GOV is just one portion of the sales that they generate. It doesn't capture the value of Drive orders right. So remember that, so the true sales from a merchant perspective is very different than what's implied by the GOV growth.

The second is if you look at what happened to our order frequency over time, we're currently at all-time highs. And that -- top of the order frequency is high both for our DashPass subscribers as well as for non-DashPass reasons. It's a both sets of both (inaudible) have actually achieved not just year-on-year, but lifetime high order frequency and that will continue to increase over time, as our selection improves, the affordability improves, and as quality improves and that will then continue to drive GOV grew for our merchants.

Operator
Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo. Your line is open, sir.

Q - Brian Fitzgerald{BIO 15325680 <GO>}
Thanks, guys. I had two questions. One was around the beat in the guidance, how much of that was driven by international versus new categories, if you could parse that out or give us some color on that? And then could you talk to the kind of different Take Rates or pricing points you rolled out last quarter? Can you talk to us about the adoption rates? Is there a tendency to move up or down versus cohorts of some of you started at a certain percentage and then started moving up to 25% to 35%. Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Sure. So, Brian on the first question. We basically saw a strength across the board on just core consumer metrics, right. So it wasn't that one part of our business beat and other didn't, But across the board, we started to see as I alluded to earlier, strong order frequency development, we saw pick up on DashPass subs, not just in the US, but also growth in our international region. As a matter of fact, our international business actually grew faster both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year compared to US business. We continue to see strength on retention and order frequency for our consumer cohorts both those cohorts that were acquired this year compared to new cohort be it in pre-COVID and retention order frequency benefits for existing cohorts that were acquired prior to the pandemic.

So across both new cohort and existing cohorts, retention and order frequency continues to be above pre-COVID levels. So, long way of saying, we've seen strength across all these fundamental consumer metrics that then ultimately led to order volume beat, that then translates to GOV in the rest of P&L.

On your question around the pricing packages. What I will say is the majority of restaurants have chosen either the Premium or the Plus Package and the Premium mix actually has outperformed our expectations and so on the whole, it's performing in line with us slightly better than expectations. If it is a sacred question, I don't think the impact on our Take Rate would be noticeable. Because there is other factors like DashPass mix and fundamental efficiency improvements that usually are much larger in magnitude than the shifts that are created by the pricing packages.

Q - Brian Fitzgerald{BIO 15325680 <GO>}
Got it. No, very clear. Thanks, guys.

Operator
Thank you. Next up we have Youssef Squali from Truist Securities. Your line is open, sir.

Q - Youssef Squali{BIO 1506420 <GO>}
Two questions from me. When I read the letter, I noticed that it's really peppered by language, mostly about higher -- the need for higher level of investment. So can you maybe quantify the higher level of investment in Dasher supply and new categories in international kind of that you quantified? How long do you think would you anticipate this investment cycle to last? And kind of -- just kind of what's the primary driver? You've obviously been aggressively investing to date, but it seems like this is a step up from what you've been doing so far. Thank you.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yeah, Youssef. So maybe just taking a step back, just want to reiterate and remind people of how we manage the business and the philosophy which is, look, we're super early in terms of the opportunity, not just in the food, but also when you add in these other categories that were now recently entered into such as convenience, grocery, pet food, icon[pj] and other. So we're tiny, tiny fraction of the potential of these categories. And that's why we're investing. So if you take a look at where we're investing, it's largely driven by new categories and to build our international business.

We're not going to break out the quantum of the investment. But I will say that we're fortunate and that we've got a US business that is firstly large, second, growing, and third, has improving margins which increase the larger profit pool that we can then use to invest in these other opportunities that are ahead of us.

Operator
Thank you. Next up we have Douglas Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open, sir.

Q - Douglas Anmuth{BIO 5591566 <GO>}
Thanks for taking the questions. So maybe just talk a little bit more about the Japan market launch. I know it's fairly new. But just curious what's some of the nuances are in that market relative to the US? And then if you could also talk about how you're thinking about Europe as well? Thank you.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean Japan, we launched the market and I only think it's been two months. So it's too early to draw any conclusions. But whenever we launch these markets in the beginning, we're super-focused on, I'm going to call product market fit parameters, more so than actual financial parameters. So let me describe what I mean.

We're looking for retention improvements. We're looking for order frequency improvement. We're looking to ensure that customers aren't retaining simply for discounts versus creating a habit with us.

And so, again it's been two months, I don't want to -- it's too early to declare a victory or anything like that. But we're encouraged by what we see. We're currently in one market which is largely -- which is Sendai. And what we're noticing is that the opportunity is available because these markets are relatively under-penetrated compared to core or (inaudible) centers. And so lots more work to do and we'll keep you posted on the progress.

And in terms of just other geographies, I mean, I'll just remind you of our priorities, one of which is to become an international company and we exist in -- we operate in Canada and Australia, and Japan today. And over time, as these other markets get bigger and start generating profit pools and we can afford to do so, we will expand obviously in an economically efficient manner in other geographies.

Q - Douglas Anmuth{BIO 5591566 <GO>}
Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Next up we have Brad Erickson from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir.

Q - Brad Erickson{BIO 18494007 <GO>}
Hey, thanks. I guess two from me. One, just within the guidance, it seems like you're looking for Q4 maybe a little bit less than seasonally normal. Is that just a reflection of your comments in the letter around uncertainty or is there something else instructing that view and feel free to recharacterize that (inaudible).

And then second follow-up from an earlier question, you've kind of ton of gross profit outside here over the past few quarters. And I guess in the letter, obviously talking towards reinvestment in a few areas. Can you just remind investors as to how the team used those choices philosophically and you trade-off growth versus profitability? Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Sure. So Brad, on the first question with respect to the guidance. Let me start by saying Q1 was elevated a little bit because of a couple of things, where these markets have just begun to reopen, vaccination rates were lower and then to compound all of that, we've had the -- let's call the inorganic impact of stimulus checks that was driving human demand -- consumer demand. And so that led to an elevated Q1.

As we look into the second half of the year and what's embedded in our guidance is really two things. The first is, what I call ordinary course summer seasonality. So in general, in Q3 using the pace of consumer acquisition slows a little bit and you have lower order rates simply because consumers are going out during the summer because the weather improves. So that's one aspect.

The second as we are baking in a level of conservatism because there is uncertainty in terms of what the world looks like in the second half of the year as markets continue reopening. Remember, it's unclear whatever even out of the pandemic at this point. And so what the long-term effects are and so there is plenty of unknowns here as a result of which we wanted to make sure we embed that uncertainty into our second half outlook.

On your gross profit upside question, the way to think about it is, we invest flexibly across the P&L. One of the reasons we do not provide revenue guidance, but we instead provide GOV guidance and EBITDA guidance is because depending on the opportunities that are available to us, we can take one of several actions in order to drive growth. We can invest through sales and marketing in terms of customer acquisition or Dasher acquisition. We can invest in pricing through low prices that would then impact Take Rate or we can invest in incentives to drive up quality, which has -- that has a further downstream impact on the Take Rate as well as on our cost of sale. So we retain this flexibility because depending on the environment we are in and depending on the exact challenges we want to be able to deploy the right strategy without having to worry about a revenue guide.

Now as you look to the future, the factors that will continue to improve the P&L, I'll go through those just as a reminder for people is, first as we improve the efficiency of the logistics network, that will have a positive impact on Take Rate. As we improve the quality the consumer experience that will lower our refunds and credits and have a positive impact on Take Rate. As we do more -- as we drive more Drive orders, (inaudible) as we do more drive orders, that will have a positive impact on Take Rate.

In terms of headwinds to Take Rate, it's really three things. As we drive increased mix of DashPass orders, I'll remind folks that, through the DashPass orders, we have lower unit revenue but significantly higher engagement of a result of which, that's a trade-off we're happy to make. Second, as we increase our investment in new categories. And third, as we increase our investment in international, because of the early stages of the evolution of these investments, usually they come with a lower Take Rate. And so you've seen the blending effect in our Take Rate as a result of these investments.

Q - Brad Erickson{BIO 18494007 <GO>}
That's great. Thanks.

Operator
Think you. Next up, we have Steven Fox from Fox Advisors LLC. Your line is open, sir.

Q - Steven Fox{BIO 2420985 <GO>}
Hi, good afternoon. Just two questions from the letter, I was curious if you could expand on. You mentioned three points of category share in the quarter and then you also mentioned gaining more DashPass subscribers. Can you give us a little bit of color around what you're seeing that's driving that? What's behind the numbers, basically? Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yeah, I think it comes down to a superior product, which is the thing we aim to deliver is the best combination of selection, affordability and quality. And what those three things translate into is category-leading spend retention. So our category-leading spend retention ultimately then translates some of these market share gains that you're seeing. DashPass is one component of that, because DashPass is how we solve the affordability lever and we'll continue to improve DashPass subscribers who have higher order frequency compared to non-DashPass subscribers and that's been now leading to increasing order frequency over time as well as improved retention has been driving market share growth.

Q - Steven Fox{BIO 2420985 <GO>}
Great. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Next one we have Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Your line is open.

Q - Ron Josey
Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to maybe Tony ask little bit more about additional -- the demand you're seeing for newer categories and also just the power of convenience. And so can you just talk about these dynamics of newer category, orders. We know they're growing faster, but does most of these orders come from restaurant orders to begin with, as an add-on? How are you marketing them? How are people being aware that you offer pets goods and alcohol and everything else. So just maybe some hindsight on strategy and awareness of these new categories would be helpful. Thank you.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Sure. I would say that we're still pretty early in that process, I mean if you think about it, the greatest privilege we have is that our consumers eat 20 times to 25 times a week. And so in terms of shots on goal or their willingness to come back to the app daily. We have the luxury to have a wide surface area and a large number of opportunities to actually engage with them.

And most of what we're trying to do is, we're trying to offer a best-in-class solution for them, whether that's shopping across multiple categories or whether that's shopping in within one category. And so for us, it's not coming from one type of use case or one type of vacation. We're still in that learning process. I think with a long ways to go, I think the industry has a long ways to go. And I mean even within our core category, I want to remind folks that of restaurants we are single-digit percentages of the restaurant industry. And when you add in some of these other categories we're a much, much smaller fraction. And so I think there's a long ways to go before we can start truly inventing technologies that will continue to change consumer preferences. The one thing that we do know is that consumers always lean towards the direction of greater and greater convenience. And so that, you should expect from future products to come.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
(Multiple Speakers) Just to remind, in Q1, we said a less than 10% of our MAUs actually use other categories of goods. So Tony's point about the surface area and short-term goal, there is a lot of opportunity just to increase awareness and drive conversion just within our existing I mean use itself without having to actually acquire customers specific to these new categories. Does that make sense?

Q - Ron Josey
That does. Thank you, that's super helpful. And maybe you talked in the letter, as well as a long complexities across these categories and you're up for the challenge. Maybe help us understand what are the complexity? And that's all I got. Thank you.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yeah, I think know what you're -- Ron, I know what you are referring to. It's really meant to be, let's say a rallying cry (inaudible) and we will enjoy the benefit from tailwinds, these past 18 months, and you cannot let those make us (inaudible). So the environment is competitors and each inch is going to be hard part and so we need to stay vigilant and laser-focused on building the best products for merchants and consumers.

Q - Ron Josey
Got it. Thank you, guys.

Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe. Your line is open.

Q - Deepak Mathivanan{BIO 17464056 <GO>}
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So two quick ones from us. First, your sales and marketing was up nicely in 2Q. Can you give some color on where these incremental spend was going, is it related to new category efforts because we thought those were primarily driven through order discounts.

And then on the -- second question on the non-food categories, there is a number of different models that we have seen out there, between marketplace, Drive, warehouses, and even more hands on modern using in-store shoppers. With all the new partnerships you have announced, can you talk about what is your preferred strategy to attack these categories? Thanks a lot.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
So maybe I'll take the first one, Deepak, on your sales and marketing question, and Tony can take your second. On the first question, and the short answer is the uptick in sales and marketing from a Q-on-Q perspective was driven primarily by our Dasher acquisition costs. Remember we spoke last at Q1, we were talking about demand were supplied. And so we have significant investments in acquiring Dashers, in fact acquiring more Dashers this quarter than we have ever in the history of DoorDash. And we also experinced high enterprise rates likely because the rideshare industry and others were competing for Dashers in our tool. So those two things led to higher Dasher cost this quarter than we had planned for, if you think about on guidance.

Now, as I look for the future, remember I will say, I expect those elevated advertising rates to come down, maybe not over the balance of this year will be somewhat conservative. But in the long term, simply because it's a different pool of people, we have discussed this in the past, the different pool of people that act as Dashers versus those that are interested in rideshare, over 75% of our Dashers are students either a part-time or full-time jobs. I think I had mentioned to you of over 90% do less than 10 active hours per weak and the nature of the job is fundamentally different because you don't need a car or have to have a car frankly in order a Dash. And so given the size of this TAM opportunity for Dashers, we do believe those advertising rates will normalize over the long term.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
And with respect to your second question, what I would say is that, at the end of the day, we take a look at this from the consumers perspective of what's going to offer the best product experience in terms of selection, quality, and price. And we do that in concert in partnership with all of our retail partners because much of this is actually requires invention. I mean if you think about, fundamentally what we're trying to do regardless of the model in which we operate, we're trying to take the physical world of physical businesses and all of the activities that they're doing and being able to give those merchant partners a digital way or frankly a new way to build their own digital businesses.

So every activity has to be re-imagined and there isn't one point solution, I would say that's going to ultimately work for every single merchant, nor is there one that's going to ultimately be consistent enough to actually solve all of the unique challenges within each respective category. We both have to -- we both aspire to build the best in class category-specific solution as well as the best in class experience across categories. And so we will continuously work with our merchant partners to invent these technologies that will continuously help change consumer preferences.

Q - Deepak Mathivanan{BIO 17464056 <GO>}
Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks, guys.

Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Spencer Tan from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.

Q - Spencer Tan{BIO 21707163 <GO>}
Hey, thank you. Just had two questions. So around the commission caps that could be potentially permanent in New York City and San Francisco. I guess if you could provide us just an update on where those stand today and how you kind of view the overall impact to your business?

And then secondly, in kind of GrubHub and the takeaway strongholds like New York City or Chicago. How are you seeing the competitive environment in Q2 and kind of maybe quarter-to-date? Thanks.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah, I'll start with the first question, I'll let Prabir take the second question. With respect to these commission caps, we're actually largely seeing city officials and allow capitalism to take its course, as most of these commission caps are actually being lifted, especially as more and more of the country is reopening and getting back into a sense of normalcy. I think with respect to the limited situations in San Francisco and New York City, our point of view is that, any approach or ordinance towards a permanent cap is frankly, A, unnecessary because if you actually read some of these commission caps and platforms like DoorDash has already offered plans well below the commission cap that it proposed.

Second, they are very harmful, in the sense that they are hurting the audience that are trying to help which of these restaurants. Because commission caps, what they do is, they will ultimately result in increased prices for consumers, lowered sales for these restaurants and reduced work opportunities for Dashers.

And finally, because of the arbitrary nature of these commission caps, they're violently unconstitutional. I think the best -- I guess synthesis of the situation might actually come from (inaudible) London breed from San Francisco, who believe that this ordinance really, unnecessarily outweighs any public good. And so that's our take and that's why you see us take litigation action in San Francisco.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
And Spencer. On your question, and really the two markets we mentioned, Chicago, New York City, were I guess competitive strongholds for one of our competitors. We are number one in Chicago, we believe shares, not just in the second quarter, but also in the first quarter of this year. In New York City, we're not number one, but it's a clear priority for us. But to be clear, we have continued to gain share, including in the second quarter, most of the other competitive share shifts have seen have occured between the other two players in that market.

Q - Spencer Tan{BIO 21707163 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you both. And congrats on the quarter.

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions)

A - Andy Hargreaves{BIO 7538434 <GO>}
Grace, it looks like we don't have any more questions in the queue. So (inaudible) pass it to Tony for quick closing remark and wrap it up.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Andy. Was there another question, Grace?

Operator
No. You may proceed the sentence.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Great. Well, thanks, everyone. I just wanted to take a moment and celebrate the fact that we fulfilled our 2 billions order in the second quarter and as someone who has seen this journey from the very beginning, I can tell you that it took us over seven years to achieve our first 1 billions order and only nine months later, we were able to see your second billions order. So I just want to take a moment to reflect on that milestone and thank all of our audiences, the team at DoorDash and all of our shareholders in what is a great achievement. Thank you very much and we'll see you soon.
