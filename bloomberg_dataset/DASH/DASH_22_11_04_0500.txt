Andy Hargreaves{BIO 22556419 <GO>}
Thanks Heather. Good afternoon, everyone and Thanks for joining us for our Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to be joined today by Co-Founder, Chair and CEO, Tony Xu; and CFO, Prabir Adarkar.

We'll be making forward-looking statements during today's call, including our expectations of our business, the macroeconomic environment, financial position and operating performance, our market and local commerce opportunities, future financial results and guidance, our strategies and our investment approach. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described, and some such risks are described in our risk factors, included in our SEC filings including our 10-Ks and 10-Qs. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information regarding our non-GAAP financial results, including a reconciliation of such non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in our letter to shareholders, which is available on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.

Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly after the call ends.

As in previous quarters, we'll go straight to questions. So with that, Heather, please open the lines, the first question.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Okay, and you first question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.

Q - Ross Sandler{BIO 15948659 <GO>}
Hey guys, congrats on the quarter. Maybe just starting with macro. Any color on what you're seeing across either the US or international markets thus far in 4Q where trends holding up pretty well versus possibly slowing down a bit and then the second question is, thanks for the chart on contribution margin for the US restaurant. That's very helpful. In the letter you mentioned that the last few quarters, you've been above that 7% level, so could you just talk about what are the biggest drivers of that, is that higher percent of repeats and getting some marketing efficiency out of that or is that driver efficiencies? any color on what's taking that north of 7 and are there markets that are in the double digits or is there like a natural limit to how high that could get? Thanks a lot.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Hey Ross, it's Tony. I'll start the first one and answer briefly the second and hand it off to Prabir. On the first question obviously, we've seen tremendous resilience in the business. The US business you've seen continued growth, north of 25% GOV, on the marketplace revenues north of 30% growth each of the last five quarters now and on the flip side, this is in the face of an energy crisis, pretty sticky inflation and war in Europe and so it's sometimes hard to try to square the two, but I think the way that we've been thinking about things, is really looking at it from a historical, current day and future perspective. Historically in the last 60 years--in that timeframe, only two of the last 60 years, have we seen a decline in food spend in the US. And that's specifically in the restaurant and grocery industry. And so, I think even though all of us are wondering how to quantify the macro headwinds, food is the most resilient category. I think historically that's shown to be true.

Current day, what we see in our own business is something largely the same. We also disclosed in the results that we saw our monthly active consumers grow all time highs in our DashPass membership program and so, we're seeing as order rates of those who joined after the pandemic have largely resemble those who joined during the pandemic. Certainly you see some softness and impact on the non DashPass cohorts on a relative basis but by and large we're talking about extraordinarily similar types of ordering behavior. So, that's what we see currently. So on a go forward basis, when I square everything, I mean even as the market leader, sometimes it's hard to remember, but we're still less than 10% of the US restaurant industry sales. When you look overseas we're a much lower percentage than that and and so when I square, I think the fundamentals both in terms of the leading industry retention and order frequency in the US business, the industry leading retention and order frequency in the European business particularly with Wolt we know who grow at 60% on a euro basis, significantly faster than its peers and, then I square that strong fundamentals with the future potential and runway in these categories. I think that's why you're seeing the resilience as well as what was reflected in our guidance.

On the second question, I think one of the things that and, I'll let Prabir talk about some of the details and specifics with respect to the contribution margin disclosure. I think when I take a step back of what has happened in the last two and a half years, obviously there was a pandemic. There was a lot of changes in the macro climate as we've seen particularly '22 versus '21 and we've seen regulatory pressures with the likes of Prop 22 and in spite of I think all of those ups, downs, sideways twists and turns, our business has grown fourfold in the US marketplace business. We've gained an extra 14 points of category share even as the market leader heading into the pandemic and we've extended that lead and so I think, I'm really proud of the team for being able to operate in such volatility and so how does that happen well. I wish there was a silver bullet but there really isn't. This is a business where you really have to be in the details, every line item counts, every line item matters, every line item compounds their interaction affects in dynamics and between the line items and, it's really measuring and managing all of these inches that I think has given us the compound interest and advantage that you've seen that accrue over the last two and a half years.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Hey Ross, It's Prabir. Just to add-on to Tony's points. Look, in comparison to other areas of e-commerce, frankly, other consumer tech companies have been fairly resilient and I think that's a function of a couple of things. It's the stickiness of the category we operate in as well as the best in class retention with our product. Logically there is some impact from macro but that impact seems to be much more limited to less habituated more occasional customers. DashPass on the other hand has higher retention as we've talked about in the past and the user behavior for DashPass continues to remain strong, and so all that to say that when you look at our consumer metrics in Q3 as well as now in October, consumer metrics continue to remain strong.

Tony pointed to our monthly active users that have grown both year-on year and quarter-on-quarter, order frequency has grown year-on year, pace of customer acquisition continues to remain strong and all of that basically establishes the foundation for solid growth not just in Q4 but into 2023 and that's what is really seeing in the results. So that's color add on macro.

On your question on the contribution margin, I think your specific question was, why 2022 incremental is higher than the average of 7%. 2021 was impacted by higher Dasher cost due to a more expensive labor market. Today the labor market has normalized but in addition we've actually made certain product improvements that have enhanced the retention of our existing fleet of Dashers and also it's been incremental supply hours from each Dasher, and a combination of these two things has actually led to a benefit in terms of Dasher all-in costs that includes cost per order as well as Dasher acquisition costs and so, this benefit in Dasher costs in 2022 has led to higher incremental this year compared to the general average.

Those product improvements will continue benefiting our cost structure and so you're seeing the impact of that by the way in our Q4 EBITDA guidance. And then on your question about the other markets above 7% and so on so forth. I just wanted to remind everyone on what we've said historically, which is, we don't operate our business to a target margin but rather we aim to maximize total profit dollars and the objective in providing the incremental percentage as well as the progression in contribution profit throughout--through COVID reopening, through Prop 22, through inflation, all these factors was really to to provide proof points on our execution and to provide visibility into our margin trajectory going forward and so practically what that means is we will flex margins that increases total profit dollars.

Your next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan. Your line is now open.

Q - Bernie McTernan{BIO 19139802 <GO>}
Great. Thank you for taking the question. On non restaurant piece and the drag on profitability can you rank order maybe put some percentage around the largest drags on total company profitability, whether it's grocery convenience or international than just thinking through. Maybe what needs to happen to unlock those to be profitable, whether it's scale are technology advancements?

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yes, maybe, I can start as Tony and, then I'll hand it to Prabir on I think some of the numbers. I think it starts--it's important to understand why we're investing in some of these categories. The goal of DoorDash was always to build the largest local commerce marketplace and the largest local commerce platform and effort to make sure that every physical business can be successful as they move into the digital economy and investments into both our non-restaurant category as well as our non-US operations, I think are really bearing fruits. If you looked at what has transpired over the last couple of years, we effectively have grown a business that was largely zero in the non-restaurants category and to several businesses of billions of dollars of GOV run rate with improving margin economics and the third-party convenience business as the category leader as well as variable profit breakeven as one example, for instance the earliest business that we started outside the restaurants category. Today we have over 75,000 partners outside of restaurants, which is more than any other platform in North America again from almost a standing start a couple of years ago and so. The way we think about investing again is similar to what Prabir said to the last question around maximizing total long-term cash flow and as we see projects, we invest according to what stage they are at and so as long as we're seeing product market fit signals, we'll continue to invest and if we don't, walk back.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yes, just to add to Tony's comments. Bernie, let me share a couple of data points that give us excitement and conviction around these investments. The first point which were made in the past is these markets that we're attempting to expand into whether the new categories or international, these are large trillion dollar markets and even a few points of penetration in these large markets could add massive scale to our business.

Second, we're seeing very strong signs of progress and in some cases we've been operating in these areas for less than a couple of years. Our new vertical, instant grocery business is growing over 80% year-on year, our US third-party grocery business is growing over 100% year-on-year that's significantly faster than other companies that operate in this space. Our international business is growing over 50% year-on-year on a constant-currency basis and you compare that to other European food delivery players that are showing single-digit year-on year growth rates and so, our performance was a function of the fact that we build a product that people like and keep coming back to i.e. better retention and growing order frequency and so we like what we see in terms of product market fit, this is exactly the thesis that we had laid out when we made these investments whether with investments in Wolt or investments in our new categories and they are playing out just as we had originally thought they would.

Now, in terms of profitability we wouldn't do any of these things unless we believe there was a path to attractive unit economics and as Tony alluded earlier we measure these things regularly to ensure that steady progress has been made towards steady economics. We're beginning to see early proof points, some of which we cited in the letter. And third-party convenience we expect to get to profit breakeven by the end of this year. We had committed to this earlier on in the year and, we're o -track to deliver on that commitment and our third-party grocery business will continue to improve margins. Q3 margins are better than Q2 and so these are exciting proof points along the way and if you look at what we've done in the US restaurant business which we laid out in great detail in the shareholder letter. It's about repeating those playbooks in these other areas. it's not--there is no single silver bullet, it'd be exact same factors around improving the efficiency of deliveries, optimizing defect rates that ultimately will help these areas get to profitability just like the US business did and so, we have a long way to go but if we continue to improve products, if we continue to get more efficient, we believe we can drive outsized growth along with margin improvement.

Q - Bernie McTernan{BIO 19139802 <GO>}
Great. Thank you and thanks for all the data in the release. It's really helpful.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan. Your line is now open.

Q - Deepak Mathivanan{BIO 17464056 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Tony, a question on investing for the long-term. Your philosophy is very clear and it makes a lot of sense, but interest rates have gone up a lot in the last like three to six months, clearly that's made the cost-of-capital for many businesses higher but as you think about internally for prioritizing projects for higher ROY's or maybe faster payback periods for this new capital environment, how are you sort of approaching this in the context of your investing philosophy, and then second question maybe for Prabir. The disclosure on US restaurant contribution margin is very helpful but maybe given that it's one of your oldest business, how should we think about the growth of it right now, there's a lot of concern that core US restaurant marketplace is maturing, maybe you can help address that at least qualitatively, that would be great. Thank you so much.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Sure. Hey, Deepak. I'll take the first one. With respect to investing frankly in any environment, whether we're talking about low-interest rate environment or high-interest environment where obviously, taking that as one input it's how we make investments, but the primary input is always going to be are we investing appropriate to the stage of the project. I think it's just as easy to overinvest when quote-unquote times are good. Even though you're not seeing the signal that you want to see and we've been very disciplined about that, whether it's been our entry into other countries or our foray into other categories beyond the restaurant category, our build-out of the advertising business. And then on the flip side. I think sometimes you can not take enough risk, especially when you have a strong robust resilient business that gives you the cash flows to invest in some of these other categories.

So, from where I sit, certainly we're taking that into accounts in terms of the cost-of-capital and making sure they are operating with discipline making sure that as we've grown tremendously, the Company over the last couple of years that we're as efficient as we were heading into the last couple of years and that takes a lot of discipline but it also takes a lot of intentional focus to make sure that we're not just investing in people but we're investing in the systems to allow us to see operating leverage into the future and so, those are the things that we're doing to make sure that we're investing with discipline but I would still say the primary endpoint especially as we look into some of these investments into newer areas, whether it's overseas or into other categories or into new business areas, it's really are we investing appropriate to the stage of the project.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
And just add one more comment to that, Deepak, which is, I'll go back to my comment about the size of these markets. These are large trillion dollar markets where money can be made and given a small amount of penetration in these markets is a lot of GMV that can convert ultimately to free cash flow and so if you just pencil out the map in the scale of these opportunities and our success with execution historically, the ROI math will work. So, what makes the math work is essentially the scale of these opportunities combined with our execution.

On your question regarding the US business and growth. I would point to a couple of things, which is, it's easy to get stuck in the quarter-to-quarter sort of dynamic and you've got third-party data providers that sometimes provide data with a little basis but what I will say is the following, which is that our level of penetration even in the US remains small whether it's a percentage of overall restaurant sales or a percentage of the population that actually using DoorDash, we're a small portion of the overall opportunity and we continue to grow. MAUs have continued to grow, which is a good sign even--despite the fact that you've had restaurants reopening, cities reopening, people going back into the store, despite that and through that our businesses continued to grow whereas in other areas of e-commerce, you've actually seen the growth expectations have been taken down and what that points to is the fact that this is an enduring category. People eat regardless of what's happening to inflationary pressures or other things, they may modulate that behavior and adjust from which restaurants they are eating out or the number of items in the basket and so on but still even you're seeing the resilience of that habit in our numbers, and so the opportunity as we look-forward in order to continue increasing the size of the scale of the business is for us to make progress on the fundamentals which is selection, quality and affordability. We talked about new categories, part of the reasons we're bringing on new categories is because it's a new use-case for those people that perhaps don't want to use DoorDash for restaurants, they can now use it to get the flowers or get their convenience items, or get there grocery items or get their liquor delivered and so growing number of our new customers now are actually coming to DoorDash in these new categories and this is going to unlock the next leg of growth as we continue increasing our penetration of the US population, So, hopefully that provide some perspective on how I think about growth on a go-forward basis.

Q - Deepak Mathivanan{BIO 17464056 <GO>}
No, very helpful thank you so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan. Your line is now open.

Q - Eric J. Sheridan{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Thank you very much for taking the question, maybe two if I can. First maybe taking a step back in a bigger-picture question. Understood the changed consumer behavior seen in the long runway on penetration, what impact has lower competitive intensity played in the industry over the last six to eight months and how do you think that potentially informs elements of some of the more mature markets, seeing only two or three players in some instances going after some of the market opportunities where it was just a couple of quarters ago that there was a lot of private capital in this sector looking at all different aspects of delivery and some of that has been more rationalized over the last couple of quarters that would be number-one and then in markets where you're more of a challenger brand than a market leader as a result of some of the markets you acquired through the Wolt acquisition, can you help us better understand how you see moving the needle from where your market share position is today to more of a market-leading position in the next couple of years, what are some of the leverage you're most focused on executing against. Thanks.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yes maybe, I can start Eric and I'll let Prabir chime in here. I think the answer to both of those questions, it's a very competitive industry out there and I'm not sure that there's never been a quote unquote let down in terms of competitive intensity and that's because at least from where I sit, I believe the highest form of competition is always growing and that's really consumer expectations. I think to me whether we are the market leader or where we are not yet the market leader, it's really about an investment in product quality. Consumers are always going to expect more selection of stores they can order from a greater affordability, better quality of service and superior customer support and to me that really at the end of the day it's what's going to rate limit our ability to penetrate the large runways that both Prabir and I have discussed with whether it's the restaurant industry, the grocery industry, the retail categories and that's really what we see but I wouldn't say that there has been lower competitive intensity in one form or another, I still think that the biggest challenge is making sure that we can get consumers to actually try the product.

I also would say that with respect to maybe the premise in the second question. I think there is a common miss-out there that Wolt is not a market leader in the majority of its markets, when it actually is and so I do think that some of this may just be where there is some unreliable third party reporting but what I would say is, both the instruction I give to our US teams or our teams overseas, it's making sure that we continue making sure to invest in the product quality so that we see gains in our retention and order frequency which only leaves us to compound that advantage over time whether that's as the market leader or whether that's someone just entering the market.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yes and just add one data point to that, Eric. I mean if you just look at Wolt's performance we're super proud of the team and what they've built in Q3, they grew 60% year on year in euro terms. Now, I can't think of an example of another European food delivery company that's going at it and from what I've seen, they are going single digit year on year, so it's hard to sit here and say that Wolt is not gaining share, just given the disparity in growth rates versus relying on third party data and issues with their approaches and so on and so, I rely on the absolute growth rate which is in my mind a pretty reliable proofpoint around the fact that the Wolt team has created a product and experience that has higher retention, enables growing order frequency and that's what's allowed them to produce the growth rates that they're posting.

Q - Eric J. Sheridan{BIO 22465717 <GO>}

Your next question comes from the line of James Lee. Your line is now open.

Q - James Lee{BIO 15949362 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking my questions, two here please. First of DashPass. I was wondering, is there any flexibility or room to increase your fees given your expanded offering and value proposition to customers and also on DashMart can you guys talk about the pace of investments in there in terms of new stores and geographic expansion, any change in the consumer behavior or unit economics to help you to confirm your long term thinking there? Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Thanks for the question, James, I'll take the first one and then Tony can talk on the second. Just as a general philosophy, we're trying to improve selection, quality and affordability and particularly in the third dimension affordability to us means reducing friction that's caused by consumer fees whether it's through DashPass or the non DashPass product. It's trying to reduce fees and commissions on merchants and increase Dasher earnings so, in our case we don't need to increase DashPass rates as a way of making the unit economics work because even at the current rates DashPass unit economics works fine even without taking into account the subscription fee. So I view an increase in subscription via DashPass as being something that would actually slow down the pace of DashPass adoption which we've been very happy with so far. It continues to remain the largest paid membership program in the food category, we hit record highs in terms of our DashPass subscribers and the pace of growth in this program is frankly been consistent despite some of the partnerships that other competitors may have entered into or despite the bundled offerings that other competitors may be providing. I mean despite all of those things we're seeing DashPass go, so we like the way it's set up like the position us for growth and at least right now there is no intent to the change in terms of the fee structure.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yes James and if I could just add a bit to this before heading into the DashMart question which is, I think one of the things I'm most proud of the team for accomplishing is that in the last two and half years even though we stated in the shareholder letter all the growth that we've seen both top and bottom line in our business, what I'm really proud of is that in achieving all of that for the platform we've been able to increase earnings for Dashers, increased sales for merchants and reduced fees on a continued basis over the last two and half years for consumers and so and DashPass certainly has been a big part of that on the consumer front but we've really done this while improving the offerings for each of the audiences that we're lucky to serve.

On the DashMart question. I think it's important to start with what we're doing and why we're doing that with DashMarts. One of the things that we've been studying very closely is why do certain industries get penetrated or why do they move from offline to online, obviously the restaurant delivery industry even though again it has a large runway for growth, it has reached a certain level of penetration that something say grocery delivery or retail delivery or delivered from other types of stores has only reached a fraction of and one of the things that we've seen so far is that the setup for third party delivery and a lot of these non restaurant categories there isn't really optimized for delivery. It's really optimized for going inside the store for browsing, as a result some of the stores don't even know exactly what's on the shelf and as a result what you see in sometimes third party delivery is a product that is more expensive than what someone would pay inside the store, they don't always get exactly what they want when they actually buy it and it doesn't always show up faster than a consumer can shop on their own and as a result you haven't seen that penetration and so our belief is in addition to working with all of these fantastic partners who we're really really privileged to work with whether it's Sprouts Farmers Markets or Giant Eagle or Loblaws or in retail categories, people like Dick's Sporting Goods or Sephora is that we want to start by working with them to really understand how can we bring incremental demand right out of the gate but we also want to invent the future of the industry and we believe the future in the industry has to offer a product that is going to give customers exactly what they expect when they order at around the same prices of what they pay in store and certainly with greater convenience and they could do it on their own and so DashMart is really a part of that and we're doing that in concert with all of these partners that we've been lucky to team up with and we're doing that here in the United States, we're doing that overseas. And that's really what DashMart is, it's going to be very important infrastructural component for the future, Now that said just like with all investments at DoorDash it's not just about the long term strategy of how can we maximize long term profit dollars, it's about how can we also invest with discipline according to the stage of the projects and so that's what we're doing with DashMarts too. It's not just what we're doing with the third party business, we're doing that with DashMart as well making sure that we can achieve product market fit. Once we see that we continue investing and if we keep seeing that grow we will continue to make those investments and so far we like what we see but there is a long road ahead right. We've just started the DashMart business really a couple of years ago, so we're learning very very quickly and we have to keep improving our product quality.

Q - Eric J. Sheridan{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Alright, thank you.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali. Your line is now open.

Q - Youssef Squali{BIO 1506420 <GO>}
Great, thank you very much. Two questions please. First, maybe just looking at the P&L your marketing efficiency has gone up tremendously. I think in the last year, I think sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue dropped by something like a 1000 basis points, so it's down not only on a percentage basis but even on an absolute basis. I was wondering if you can kind of unpack that a little bit for us in terms of where is the efficiency coming from, is it better ad rates, maybe less spend on US restaurant category where you obviously dominate, maybe just kind of help us understand the drivers of that and is that primary driver for the higher EBITDA expectation for Q4, and second on the Wolt, maybe just help us understand the acceleration in GOV's there. I think in the letter you talked about customer acquisition at an all time high, which is really impressive just all things considered. So maybe just help us understand again sustainability of that as we go forward and maybe specific countries where you're seeing such a huge performance. Thank you.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Hey Youssef, maybe I'll take both of those questions and Tony chime in if anything else to add. So first on the marketing efficiency point I just wanted to go back to. Some of the comments that we had shared when we went public back at the S1 which is once you've acquired a cohort and the cohort sort of gets into the second third, fourth year of life the marketing spend associated with that cohort declined and declined materially, right because there is no quote unquote marketing and maintenance spend that's required.

And so what that means is as our business gets larger and our base of existing consumers gets larger that provides leverage in sales and marketing. Now, more specifically if you were to tear apart the sales and marketing line and look at GAAP versus Dasher acquisition costs versus merchant acquisition costs there is leverage on CAG but particularly in '22 compared to '21, there's been a lot of leverage in terms of our Dasher acquisition costs and that's been driven by product improvements that we've made. We're making it easier to Dash. Dashers are putting more hours into our platform, the retention of our fleet has gone up and as a result that means we need to acquire fewer Dashers to actually--to fulfill the deliveries that are happening on our platform. And so that's provided leverage in addition to the point I made about an increase in the existing base of consumers. So that's in response to your marketing efficiency question.

When on the Wolt question it comes down to couple of factors. I mean, Wolt operates in markets with 300 million people and these markets have low levels of penetration. In fact even in the oldest markets Wolt adoption levels are less than 10%, so there's a lot of room for growth just to expand, customer acquisition in the markets in which they operate as well as expand to new cities in those countries in which those up in which they operate, so that coupled with the fact that the retention in the Wolt app is super high and order frequency continues to increase because the macro point is that people like eating, people like the convenience of food delivery and therefore they only end up increasing the utilization of the product, the combination of these two things that help them drive the results that you're seeing.

Q - Youssef Squali{BIO 1506420 <GO>}
Super helpful, thank you.

The next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth. Your line is now open.

Q - Douglas Anmuth{BIO 5591566 <GO>}
Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask if you have any update to your commentary from last quarter just suggesting a modest increase in '23 EBITDA and then secondly two things to come up a lot with investors, higher insurance costs and then also the regulatory environment just given the DOO ruling and Prop '22 status still outstanding, so if you could comment on that thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Sure maybe I'll start and Tony could chime in wherever he wants. So on the EBITDA point, I think we said in the letter the we expect that the US restaurant business we continue to grow in 2023 and will increase its contribution profit both in dollars and margin topped but historically what's happened is we've taken the majority of those profits and we've reinvested them in these investment areas. We're at a point where these investment areas getting exhibiting margin improvement and so the investment dollars don't perfectly offset the increase in the contribution profit in the restaurant business and that's going to create some flow through impact to EBITDA so the combination of these two things which is increasing restaurant profits coupled with margin improvement in the investment areas will help us increase annual EBITDA both in dollar and margin terms in 2023.

The only caveat I'll make is we continue to remain in investment mode and I will change this this approach if we identify attractive growth opportunities but today at current trajectory and current course and speed we expect to increase annual EBITDA.

On your question on insurance, actually when you look at our insurance costs in Q3 versus Q2 as a percentage of our GOV our insurance costs were flat so, good progress in Q3. I won't declare a win as yet, we've got to watch this closely but there has been no increase at least as a percentage in Q3 relative to Q2.

Yes Doug and on the question regarding regulatory and what we're seeing we're largely seeing pretty much exactly what we would expect I mean I think just to make sure we are on the same fact basis with respect to the deal announcement that was made recently, it doesn't change our business model or reclassify drivers in many ways just is an affirmation of President Obama's administration determination that there are independent contractor workers out there and more broadly there largely quite supportive of this line of work and show what we've seen is outside of a handful of cities and it's been the same count of cities that have I would say frankly it perhaps abuse their power and are trying to overregulate the industry. By and large, I think lawmakers regulators and anyone in policy that we've spoken to has been very productive in terms of making sure that we can serve Dashers together.

I mean, again let's remind everyone that we are Dashers one in terms of their activity the average Dasher and we're talking about 3 million Dashers every quarter. And Dashers are working, fewer than four hours a week on average, 90% of Dashers work fewer than 10 hours a week this is in the United States and so what they're saying with their feet as the number one thing they value but the DoorDash platform is really the flexibility that offers and then when you look at what they say. I mean look at you take proposition '22 as an example dashers preferred--87% of Dashers preferred staying as independent contractors, vast majority of voters and California supported Proposition '22 and so I'm optimistic that regulators and policymakers take this into account and actually reflect Dashers one which is that, they would like to see labor laws catch up candidly to the modern day realities what the future of work really is which is people ought to be able to control where they work, when they work and. And that's really what we see so we don't really expect any new changes versus what we've said before.

And Doug. Just to add to Tony's comments there. Obviously in some cases this regulation introduces new costs into the system and our goal in such situations is trying to execute as efficiently as we can and try to optimize away the cost but in terms of the situations the costs might be onerous and cannot be entirely optimized away and so we have a right and an expectation to go to generate a profit in the markets we operate in and if there's overly orders we will act to protect our EBITDA guidance and so I want to make sure that's clear.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak. Your line is now open.

Q - Brian Nowak{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Tony just on business philosophy and sort of risk management through different macro scenarios. The business is holding on great so far but if we sort of walk into a scenario where in '23 potentially we have a weaker consumer in the US or Europe and maybe more cash flow generated in the US business decelerates or has some impact from macro, can you just sort of put us in that world and talk to us about sort of your investment philosophy in both your more developed businesses as well as the earlier more developing products just to ensure you're best positioned to drive in industry post recovery, while also doing the best you can to sort of maintain improve employee morale which in part probably matters around the stock?

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Hey Brian yes. I mean--I think the investment philosophy has been largely consistent with what we've done and I mean I think even when I think about the last 10 quarters, basically from one we become public to where we are now, what we outlined in the S1 we've kind of discontinued marching towards that drumbeat of telling the narrative of how we want to be the local commerce company both building the largest local commerce marketplace, largest local commerce platform and how we're making investments in towards doing that.

I think it's important to take note of what happened in the last two and half years and we went from one business line company into now five businesses with investments into operations overseas outside of restaurants category and apps business, a platform business with products like DoorDash Drive and Storefront. And so when I think about what we are today the biggest thing that I've been thinking a lot about is how do we actually make sure we continue to stay disciplined about investing commensurate to the stage of those projects. Now obviously there's a lot of macro headwinds as you mentioned that have changed in the past year but for me all that suggested it's going to put pressure on our execution but obviously if it puts pressure on the consumer which is I think the point that you are going towards and we're not seeing signal in some of these investment areas then we certainly would pull back and invest accordingly and so for me it's really again about keeping that discipline even though we've gone from one business now to five businesses and just also put things in perspective just for everyone on the line, a lot of the investment dollars are going into non US and non restaurant category businesses and the size of those investments now have built a business that's larger than all of DoorDash just a few years ago and so we certainly like what we see but obviously if we're seeing behavior come down because of macro pressures, we will invest accordingly.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
And just to add to Tony's comments, Brian. I mean remember our core US restaurant business is growing and generates significant cash flow right and historically we've invested the vast majority of this to grow scale in these other areas, including new categories and international but these investments are discretionary. And that means that if for one reason or another we're better served by pulling back on investment because we're not seeing the right signal in terms of consumer demand, because we're not seeing the rate improvement in terms of unit economics on whatever we can alter the base of the investment. So far we've been pretty disciplined with capital allocation and you can see that in the results in terms of US restaurant business and the plan is to continue being equally disciplined going forward.

Your final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney. Your line is now open.

Q - Mark Mahaney{BIO 3027058 <GO>}
Okay, thanks, two questions please. I know somebody already asked you about macro impact on the demand side, anything you'd call out on the supply side, anything about the need for extra side hustle that's maybe led you to bring in more Dashers and then secondly, Prabir, your comments about '23, we always parse your words very carefully, that last quarter you had said increased annual EBITDA by a modest amount and this time when finishing your answer to the question just said you would increase annual EBITDA but you didn't use the modest word, is there anything to read into that. Sorry to ask you such a precise question but just want to make sure we're not missing any nuances. Thank you.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yes, maybe I'll take both. Mark, on the Dasher supply question this is the point I made in through today's conversation around the labor market being more normalized this year than it was last year and so that's having an impact on obviously to some degree advertising rates but also in terms of supply that's available to become Dashers and that benefit has been turbocharged by product improvements that have now improved the retention of the fleet and is actually generating incremental supply hours from existing Dashers until both of those things means you just don't have-- you don't need to acquire as many new Dashers. So the labor environment--so long story short labor environment has resulted in all in Dasher costs being better today and because of the improvement that we've made we expect that to continue benefiting our cost structure in Q4 as well in 2023 provided there is no shocks to the labor environment.

On the question around 2023 I'd urge you not to over extrapolate on a word or two. Really we're not providing quantitative guidance but what I am trying to share with you is when you think about the underlying dynamics of the business the reason you didn't see a lot of EBITDA expansion going from '21 into '22 was because the pickup in terms of contribution profit from the US restaurant business was largely soaked up by the investments.

We're at a point right now where the investments are getting better from a margin perspective while the US business continues to grow and therefore to tow off more dollars and as continuing improvements in the margins, it's not a perfect offset anymore, it used to be, not anymore and that's going to generate incremental EBITDA both in dollar terms and in margin terms. We'll come back to you with specific guidance on 2023 in Q4 which is in line with our normal cadence.

Q - Mark Mahaney{BIO 3027058 <GO>}
Okay, thank you, Prabir.
