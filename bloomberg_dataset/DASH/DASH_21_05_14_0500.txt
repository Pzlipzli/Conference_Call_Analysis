Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our first quarter of 2021 earnings call. I'm pleased to be joined today by Co-Founder, Chair and CEO, Tony Xu; and CFO, Prabir Adarkar.

We'd like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements during this call, including statements regarding our expectations of our business, future financial results and guidance and strategy. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements. And such risks are described in our risk factors included in our SEC filings, including Form 10-K. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information regarding our non-GAAP financial results, including a reconciliation of such non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in our investor letter, which is available on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.

Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of the call will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. We're going to go straight into the questions today. So May, please take the first question.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Our first question is from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.

Q - Lloyd Walmsley{BIO 15125459 <GO>}
Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I can. Just first, in the shareholder letter, you called out increased frequency from existing customers who order convenience and I'm curious if you can just put a finer point on that. Is that increases in frequency even on the food delivery side just more of a situation be have? Or is it more just the comment that convenience is additive and not cannibalistic? And I guess maybe in periods where the product is more full in terms of other things you offer on the platform on top of good convenience, other stuff, are there similar dynamics where there is the more categories people use it across the more they use within individual categories?

And then the second question would just be on the new commission packages. How are you seeing kind of merchants react the new packages? Are they opting into the higher value bundles? And what should we kind of expect in terms of our take rate impact from that, anything you can share there would be great? Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Hey Lloyd, it's Prabir. Why don't I take the first question on the frequency comment and then Tony will take the second. It's the latter thing you mentioned which is what we actually find is that these categories are symbiotic with one another. So customers who order from new categories subsequently increase their frequency with restaurants by a greater amount than those who do not order from new categories said differently, once you begin to use multiple categories that actually increases your engagement with the core restaurant category. And then the other thing we found is that customers who actually engage with us across different categories beyond food, also creating best stronger retention and engagement versus restaurants place there versus consumers appear that they're already start selling. So we're actually seeing strength because the addition of categories being skewed mix user stickier with our platform.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah. Hey Lloyd, this is Tony. On the second question, the business impact is reflected in our guidance and it's something that we feel pretty comfortable and as we tested this program as we do with all of our new initiatives with merchants for last 6 month. So it's meeting our expectations in terms of our rollout so far. But I thought I take a second to give you a bit of the guiding principles or the design principles behind why we shipped what we announced a couple of weeks ago.

If you take a step back, we took quite a lot of actions during the pandemic to make sure that these businesses will be successful, that's the entirety of why DoorDash was founded to make sure that these local businesses would succeed. And so during the pandemic, I'm very proud that the actions we took, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of investments we made allow these businesses to have a time the odds of surviving the pandemic versus the average restaurant in the industry.

Now as we get out of the pandemic and as we start heading into reopening, which I'm very excited about given where the country is in terms of vaccination rates increasing and such, is that we wanted to give these business owners and speaking with them for about 6, 7 months about this, the best chance of getting out of the gate as fast as possible. And what we heard over and again was they really want a choice, choice on the spectrum of investing in growth and in which case they can pick some of the higher price plans that allows them participation in programs like Dash password, DoorDash is covering the cost of delivery or choice in the form of greater profitability, depending on how they're seeing staffing and things like that as they get into recovery.

Choice in the form of whether the orders are coming from the DoorDash app or their own channel, where we're offering commission-free no-cost product called DoorDash Storefront, which will allow them to build their own digital channels, as well as choice in the form of non-delivery use cases like pickup, where we flash rates from 15% to 6%. And so that really was the reason why we shipped what we announced, and we have been working with these merchants for about six months on it and in terms of the financial impact or the impact on the business, all of that is reflected in our guidance.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
And just to add one point to that. If you actually look at these programs, there is an offset between the lower commission rate that comes with the higher consumer fee. It's not a perfect offset, but just keep that in mind as you think about the ramifications, Lloyd.

Q - Lloyd Walmsley{BIO 15125459 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks, guys. Nice quarter.

Operator
Next in line is Douglas Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.

Q - Douglas Anmuth{BIO 5591566 <GO>}
Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First, just hoping to talk more about your thoughts on impacted reopening and perhaps just how your thoughts have changed relative to three or six months ago, if at all? And then second question just on Dasher supply, I guess just how do you get comfortable with how that can play out here in the coming months, given some of the supply issues of course with ride-sharing and in some other areas? Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Hey Doug, thanks for the question. So the first thing I'd say is we were encouraged by the trends that we saw in the first quarter, particularly as markets reopened in in-store dining grew. The negative impact to consumer behavior was smaller than initially anticipated. And that enabled us to actually beat our Q1 guidance by 9%. What's driving that is the commentary we made even at our earlier earnings call, we talked about consumer behavior being sticky.

So as consumers begin to use the product, new habits develop and those habits tend to persist and part of that's been bolstered by the fact that the product have gotten to be better over the course of time, just because of this past year, the selection of the platforms improved in terms of the number of restaurants, as well as new categories such as convenience stores and grocery stores, quality has improved, our affordability has gotten better and all these streams continue to back and support of continued stickiness as far as consumers go. And so as we look to the future, we're optimistic about the balance of the year, which led to an increase of guidance by about 15% to $35 billion to $38 billion of GMV.

On your second question, I know ride-share is focused on this, but it's important to remember that ride-share drivers are a different pool of people than our Dashers. Over 75% of our Dashers are students sort of either part-time or full-time jobs, on average they Dash less than four hours per week, Dashers don't require a car, they can Dash on bikes. Our population of Dashers tend to skew more female and that's likely because you don't have to share your personal space with another individual.

And so, even in our survey data shows a 21% of our Dashers have ever driven for ride-share and only 6% say this before ride-share, so a completely different pool of people. We had a little bit of a supply blip in March, but we solved the issue. We acted quickly. We took a bunch of actions, including improving the efficiency of the logistics network, expanding our marketing funnels, improving our conversion rates for Dashers and now we're now acquiring more Dashers per week than we were compared to Q1. So we're well supplied today, and we expect that to be the case for the foreseeable future.

Q - Douglas Anmuth{BIO 5591566 <GO>}
Thank you, Prabir.

Operator
Next is Youssef Squali from Truist Securities. Your line is now open.

Q - Youssef Squali{BIO 1506420 <GO>}
Great. Thank you very much, and congrats on the impressive quarter. Just two, if I may. First, can you just speak to the recent trends that you've seen so far in May? I think your guide speaks to it, but anything to highlight in terms of just the competitive intensity? And how you guys feel about the particularly growth in the non-food delivery business in the quarter contribution to it?

And second, as you look at the diversification that you're embarking on into non-food convenience grocery set up, I was wondering if you can just speak to the broader -- well, first, how big do you think that business could become over time? Is this a situation where you could see a scenario where half of your business is coming from these new initiatives say over the next three to five years? But probably, also just how do you see that impacting the take rate over time? Thank you.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Sure. Hey, it's Tony. I'll start. So far the quarter is off to a great start and what I'll say is that the impact of reopening really has been more muted than we expected. Certainly, when we are looking at this last fall and even as we're starting to prepare for this towards even last summer. With respect to some of the new categories, we're very excited about our progress. I mean, growing 40% quarter-on-quarter, our non-restaurant orders now are totaling over 7% of our total orders and again this happened in a pretty short period of time. We really in earnest launched our second category outside of restaurants and convenience, where we're now the market leader in just under a year. So things are certainly ahead of plan and exceeding our expectations there.

With respect to I think the broader question of how this plays out and unfolds as to remind all of us on the call, as I mentioned during our actually very first earnings call, we're really investing in four areas. We're investing certainly to grow our core business, and we're seeing greater strength there, especially as we saw record engagements in the quarter, as well as our investment into other use cases such as pickup, where we're also the market leader now or the office business like DoorDash for Work. We are investing certainly into new categories. We're also investing into the build out of our platform so DoorDash is as much a marketplace, our app that grows orders as well as the platform that gives you products like DoorDash Drive, DoorDash Storefront to help merchants build their own channels and then finally international market growth. And so those are the four buckets of where we're investing. And we're very, very excited by both how things are progressing in all of these areas, as well as what that might mean for diversification in the future.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
And Youssef, if I could just add to that, I mean, some of the markets you mentioned, whether it's convenience or grocery, these are extremely large markets. Convenience is $250 billion, grocery is an $800 billion -- trillion dollar market, but the thing that's unique is both of these have very low penetration rates and you think about our platform and the success that we enjoy in convenience up to this point despite launching that business 12 months ago, it's because of the extensivity of our platform, because we take a hybrid approach the bears together, not just third party partners in our marketplace like CVS, like Walgreen, like 7-Eleven in fact Rite Aid recently announced, but also we're bringing our own for study selection to consumers in order to provide consumers a choice and serve them in underserved neighborhoods. And so advertising is extremely low today, but a lot of runway for growth.

Next question is from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is now open.

Q - Ross Sandler{BIO 15948659 <GO>}
Hey guys, just a quick follow-up on the last one and then one other one. So the 7% of orders for non-restaurant. Can you just talk about the unit economics of that business and then you go to market like Instacart, I think is mostly getting its profit pool from ads process one key business. So how do we think about the blended offering that you guys have an EBITDA per order you mentioned is a little bit lower for convenience, any color there would be helpful on the EBITDA per order?

And then it sounds like based on the letter that you guys are expecting a little bit of a drop off into the summer, which I think everybody can totally understand as things reopen. The question is more like, as you look at the data, are you seeing new customers that came in in 2020? Are those the ones that are going to drop off? Or is it that the higher frequency DashPass folks who order like five times a month are just going order less, when we get to the summer? Any color on that would be helpful? Thanks, guys.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Hey Ross, so on the first question in terms of the unit economics, we're not actually breaking out even economics with these orders. What I will say is we're fortunate in that our core in US business is cash generative, and we're taking that cash, and we're investing it to grow some of the new verticals with its convenience or grocery or expand into new merchant services like Storefront, as well as expanding nation. So we're fortunate to have a profitable core business that allows us to invest in new areas.

On the question regarding the summer seasonality, the trajectory that was baked into the guidance is the fact that starting about April and going all the way through to Labor Day, usually as the weather improves, we see consumers go dining and that behavior is generally consistent across both new customers that we recently acquired as well as existing customers that have been in the platform for a while. It just could be just behavior that we tend to see as weather improves and people want to go out a little bit more. So you don't see it in our historical numbers partly because of the rapid pace of customer acquisition. But if you look at it on a cohort level, it's they're booking for new and existing cohorts.

Next is Ralph Schackart from William Blair. Your line is now open.

Q - Ralph Schackart{BIO 7200102 <GO>}
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I'm just curious if you could provide maybe a little more color on Dasher pay and incentive trends that you've seen both in the quarter, maybe kind of quarter-to-date? And on the letter you talked about 40% pay increase, 13% I think decrease for cost to consumers over a two year period. It sounds like you're in better supply situation now which is great. Just curious if you could give some more color on kind of recent trends and then sign ups? Are some of those getting passed on the consumer? And then eventually as government incentive programs subside, do you think the driver incentives will normalize over time? Thank you.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Ralph, maybe I'll take that question. The summary is we're expecting take rates to improve sequentially from Q1 to Q2 and in part that's driven by the fact that Dasher pay will normalize because the supply state is actually better today, the problem has been resolved and the brock market is back to health. Taking a step back, just in terms of our Dasher pay, we've said before, in the context of overall strategy, our North Star is to reduce customer price as consumer prices reduce the fees and commissions we charge from merchants and increase earnings for Dasher. And so the 40% year-over-year increase in Dash earnings for that devour is consistent with our general philosophy. So as we continue to squeeze out more efficiency out of the logistics network, as we continue to improve our default rate and that results in unit economic improvements. We invest a lot of that back into the ecosystem by taking down fees and by increasing Dasher earnings.

Q - Ralph Schackart{BIO 7200102 <GO>}
Great. And if I could squeeze one more. And just on the pickup opportunity you talked about on the call and the letter, it seems a pretty good opportunity for you post-COVID environment. Maybe just talk about sort of how that's been received by consumers kind of what you've learned? And as you had sort of technology to that long-term some innovation, what are your views on this opportunity? Thank you.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Sure. I'll take that, it's Tony. I think the greatest privilege we probably have in this business is that people eat 20 to 25 times a week, maybe more, maybe less during this pandemic But what I will say is that when someone is doing that kind of frequency of consumption, it's never going to happen in one method. It's never going to be all in cooking, it's never going to be all in eating out or eating in or getting deliveries, especially as we get out of the pandemic, we're going to go back to doing some of the things that I think are now priced commodities, like grabbing a coffee on the way to work or doing a walk along the block with your colleagues and grabbing a snack or what have you and so we're seeing quite a lot of excitement to the pick up products. I think not just because people are tired of being stuck at home, but I think people are -- I think there is just a mere fact because we consume so often that this is one of the natural use cases that governs our behavior and so we're very excited to continue investing there.

Q - Ralph Schackart{BIO 7200102 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Tony. Thanks, Prabir.

Operator
Next is Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.

Q - Deepak Mathivanan{BIO 17464056 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. One for Tony and one follow-up for Prabir. Can you talk about your partnership strategy for the new categories? I mean you've entered into partnerships with a lot of retailers directly. But as you kind of think about expanding it further over the next few years, how should we think about your desire to work with platforms that have offline business integrations like the online presence systems, point of sale software companies, shop acquire and even companies like Facebook to scale the margin side rapidly on both marketplace and drive?

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah. I'll start. Hey Deepak, it's Tony. So the way that we look at all things is how do we build the best products and before our marketplace what that really means is how do we offer the best selection, quality, price and customer service and for our platform business where we're building tools for merchants to allow them to grow their own digital businesses, it's really about how do we allow them to be very successful across all the activities that they have to perform in order to build a digital business. And still with that, I suppose, as the guiding principle, we would consider any partnerships that achieve those means and they can look different depending on whether or not they fit into our marketplace or whether or not they fit into our platform.

And so at DoorDash, we really are thinking about building the system that has both components, one, the system is our app, which is trying to grow all of local commerce and bring everything inside your neighborhoods in minutes, not hours or days. And then on the other side, we are trying to empower you, the merchants, to replicate and grow on top of your four-wall business and competes in today is digital economy. So any partnerships that fit introspective part of our business and then the two jobs that we do which is to grow and to empower local commerce were all years.

Q - Deepak Mathivanan{BIO 17464056 <GO>}
Got it. Now that's very helpful, Tony. And then, Prabir, can you talk about the second half guidance on GOV? Should we expect that year we just saw bottom out in 3Q and it start improving sequentially in 4Q into 2022? How are you thinking about like the slope in the second half? Thank you so much.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yeah. The second half GOV is impacted by two factors. The first we're baking in some uncertainty with respect to consumer be there as markets continue to reopen and there is increased vaccination rates. But second, to your point, there is some seasonality, even that region continues to Labor Day until you've got Q2 and Q3 a better GOV and then as the winter season start setting in, you start to see growth from there right now. So it's basically what you pointed out, the one thing I will say, Deepak is just stepping back the GOV guidance for the year is materially higher than what we thought at the beginning of the year. So I'd point to the shape of the curve you see at the model rate, but at the end of the day, that's not inside of the big picture, which is we were feeling more optimistic today than we were earlier on.

Q - Deepak Mathivanan{BIO 17464056 <GO>}
Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks, guys.

Operator
Next is Michael McGovern from Bank of America. Your line is now open.

Q - Michael McGovern{BIO 18870970 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great quarter. I just wanted to ask maybe about -- maybe just like a regulatory overview. It seems like there's been a lot of news items on the regulatory side recently. So maybe first, if you could comment about the federal side and the comments from the Department of Labor Secretary recently and just any views on what could happen in long-term on the federal side? And then I think some of your peers in the gig economy or ride-share space have talked about potentially working out deals with states that might look similar to Prop 22. So can you share with us if you're participating in those kind of discussions or just what you think about the potential for regulatory developments on the state side as well? Thank you.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah. Hey Mike, it's Tony, I'll take that. So we're very excited about what we heard. Secretary Walsh and the Biden administration say which to our ears was that they're very excited in figuring out with us with the private sector companies how to actually construct a model that takes us into the 21st century instead of I guess moving backwards toward the 20th century. I mean if you think about it what DoorDash stands for is optimizing for the worker. So in this case the Dasher, the millions of drivers on our platform.

And the number one thing we hear over and again from Dashers is that they want this flexibility that has never existed in any labor environment before. And the question is how do we marry that in the face of traditional labor definitions with benefits and protections that we believe they deserve. And what we heard from really anyone we stick to is a willingness to engage in that conversation and construct forward a third way in which we can compare this independence and flexibility with benefits and that's true at the federal level, that's true at the state level and any elected official that we speak with.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Mike, just to be clear, the dealers we clear that we aren't taking immediate action and said want to give them some -- we're in dialog with the federal government as well as in state level.

Q - Michael McGovern{BIO 18870970 <GO>}
Got it. Maybe just as one quick follow-up to that. I thought the prior comments about the difference between Dashers and ride-share drivers were really important, especially on the regulatory front. So could you talk about just like the hostility that ride-share drivers and food delivery couriers are regulated separately with different rules? Or do you think that gig economy workers could just all be kind of lumped together long term in terms of like the regulatory response in development?

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yeah. I'm not sure that we've got a full confusion on this matter. I mean, as you know, as Tony indicated, the secondary washes comment actually suggest an openness to engage with the private sector to figure this stuff out. So it's a little probably need to signal whether ride-share that it was we could together with the broader gig economy that's get up there. We'll come back, if there's any update on this topic as our conversations progress.

Q - Michael McGovern{BIO 18870970 <GO>}
Got it. Thanks so much.

Operator
Next is Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open.

Q - Sean Meier
Thanks. This is Sean on the call for Jason. So just one on, how are you guys thinking about the risk around local pricing cash and how is this taken into account with new merchant pricing model? And then second, can you talk about the competitive environment around non-food sales relative to the environment food deliveries is more competitive, good at the same, less competitive, what are you guys doing there? Thank you.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah. Hey Sean, it's Tony, I'll start. So on the first question around commission caps, what we expect is that these commission caps will be rolling off pretty soon. In fact we've already seen some of this and some very large cities whether it's Chicago, Kansas City, Cincinnati, I saw some even roll off earlier this week and so we're very encouraged I think by what we're seeing, which is elected officials allowing capitalism to do its job and allow everyone to really make things work for all audiences. And we're the first to be excited at DoorDash to have obstacles go back inside restaurants. And I think people will and I think that's, as that continues to happen as the reopenings occur, more and more folks will see delivery as an augmented way to help grow these physical businesses and to be one part of the portfolio of how they do business moving forward.

I think with respect to the second question, which is around I think you asked about the competitive environment and some of these newer categories. I mean, look, I would say that certainly things have exceeded our expectations. If you look at the fact that we started just a year ago in our first non-restaurant category convenience and in about a year's time, we've become the market leader in that category. I think really just show the strength of both actually across all audiences. The receptivity to our platform, how Dashers are willing to do deliveries across different hours of the day, different categories, how consumers are willing to see us help solve different jobs at different times of the week, and how different types of merchants will like to have access to the largest on demand food audience and that comes to us at the highest frequencies every month.

And so, so far we are seeing quite a lot of progress in these areas. But to Prabir's earlier points to an earlier question, we had the beginning of a massive transformation that's just unfolding. I mean just to remind all of us even in the core restaurant business, even if you added all of the sales up for the largest platforms in the US, were about 10% or less of the entire restaurant industry. If you did the same math for some of these other categories that we're entering via convenience, grocery and others, that number is very, very, very small single-digits. And so we've a massive runway ahead.

Next question is from the line of Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Your line is open.

Q - Ron Josey
Great, thanks for taking the question and really great quarter. I wanted to ask two please. One on DashPass and you talked about subscribers more than doubled year-over-year, average order frequency is an all-time high and I think you even mentioned that new users joining in 1Q was somewhat of a record. But can you talk about the strategic nature of DashPass here just specifically as you think about increasing the penetration of new categories and their interest in the MAUs used for new categories? Just how you see both DashPass and new categories are working together?

And then, Tony, maybe as a follow-up to your prior answer and this is a weird question maybe, but could it be that with the reopening the amount of change in consumer behavior, the reopening might actually help longer term about how we as consumers just order things, restaurant food, etcetera, online and how you're thinking about how the reopening might actually be a tailwind? Thank you.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Ron, it's Prabir. I'll take the first one, and Tony will take the second. Look DashPass at the end of the day is a core pillar of our strategy to think about what we're going to do for consumers it's to deliver the wider selection, the best quality and superior affordability. And DashPass start right to the heart of both selection, as well as price because with DashPass, as you know, consumers pay more delivery fees and introduced services fees on their orders and so what we're finding is consumers, particularly they start increasing the engagement will derive value out of the fact that the subscription fee, the cost of multiple industries and multiple orders and we've seen the value proposition of a DashPass translating into sign ups that have been allowed us to grow the DashPass membership of these to be 2x than it was a year ago.

And another aspect of the strategy is to continue adding verticals into DashPass. So much the same way Amazon Prime allows you to consume products across multiple categories, that's our vision for DashPass with Starwood Food and over time, we've added convenience stores and then and over time as we continue to add categories you'll see those get slotted into DashPass to improve the consumer value proposition.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah. And with respect to the second question around the reopening as a possible tailwind, I guess, no one has the crystal ball in terms of how this shape recovery occurs and to, I think, in the earlier discussion how the slope of change happens. But what I would say is that the long-term trend is that when it comes to convenience, things always move towards the direction of greater to convenience, which means that over the long term and I suppose, if you look at it from that perspective, the tailwind thesis would be that all that's happening is that we've kind of shifted some of the growth that was otherwise going to happen by who knows some period of time. And I think what it has allowed is just that it's allowed more and more people to be more and more comfortable with this type of business, which allows possibly faster entry into other categories as we power all of local commerce, for example.

And so I think that's kind of where we're seeing it, but I do just want to remind people that convenience only moves in the direction better convenience. I mean if someone wanted to go and eat inside of a restaurant, for example, they're probably not thinking about delivery. Conversely, if they're thinking about takeout or delivery, they probably are never going to go inside the restaurant in the first instance. And so I think it's again, I always like to step back in moments where we're trying to figure out what seems like a very difficult question to take a slightly longer time horizon and think what's the greatest privilege we have here is that people eat 20 to 25 times a week and do we see some share of that growing into more convenience, we believe the answer is yes.

We have our next question from Spencer Tan from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.

Q - Spencer Tan{BIO 21707163 <GO>}
Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just I think one question around guidance. So it looks like if you were to take the midpoint of your GOV and EBITDA guidance that you're guiding to EBITDA accretion versus prior quarters. Just wondering if that's a direct refillable from the commission structure change that you announced this quarter? And how we should think about that, maybe just providing a little bit more color around that specifically?

And then secondarily, I guess, looking into the recovery, are you seeing any restaurants consolidate the platforms that they utilize? And do you think that DoorDash has a competitive advantage from that standpoint by offering other types of software as a service and Storefront versus maybe some of the smaller competitors out there, i.e. having the ability to maybe gain a little bit more share from some of your comps? Thank you.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Sure. So if I answer the question correctly, because I do with the EBITDA margins and that is our GOV picking up slightly, is that right?

Q - Spencer Tan{BIO 21707163 <GO>}
Yeah.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Got you. Yeah. Look, what I'd say is would be provided a range of EBITDA, but if you just reiterate the way we manage our business, it's to try to maximize scale and so to the extent that the opportunity is available to invest in order to beat top line, we will do that all day long. The reason for expanding the guidance compared to the prior quarter is simply we don't want to feel compelled to have to spend the money in the quarter, if we don't find the right term cash flows. And so what this allows us to do is to drop that profitability to the bottom line in the event that the right investment opportunities and the slight margin accretion that you see is because of the sequential increase in the peak rate that we're expecting in Q2 because if that rate will normalize.

Q - Spencer Tan{BIO 21707163 <GO>}
Okay. Yeah. Perfect.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
And with this at this time, with respect to your second question, yes, we do believe that by having a wider portfolio of products, we can certainly serve more use cases both from a consumer perspective, as I was mentioning earlier, people eat 20 to 25 times a week and so by having more use cases, whether it'd be in delivery, pick up, the office business, we're serving a bigger addressable market and it's a closed share of stemming from that regard and then with respect to the merchants, on the platform piece, where we're not only their largest source of incremental demand through our app, but the fact that we also power their own channels, power their deliveries that gives us greater ordered entity, which drives lower fulfillment costs, but it also allows us to take up greater kitchen capacity, as we're powering the majority of the space that is being used up to produce the food in the first instance.

And so I think those are some ways in which our suite of products are generating competitive advantage both for the consumer in terms of just giving a lot more value beyond delivery, as well as some of the things that Prabir said earlier, where we're adding more categories at no extra charge into a program like DashPass. And then on the merchant side, the wide portfolio of products that choose either to grow through the largest source of incremental demand or app or the fact that we're powering all of their channels allows us to certainly work with merchants more but also take out more of their production capacity.

Q - Spencer Tan{BIO 21707163 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you so much, and congrats on the quarter.

Next question is from the line of Clark Lampen from BTIG. Your line is now open.

Q - Clark Lampen
Hi, good evening. Tony or Prabir, in light of some speculation on M&A that's come up somewhat recently, I wanted to see if we could revisit how you guys are thinking about both new market entry and also specifically weighing up sort of build versus buy options for doing that? Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yeah. Look, I mean, we've said previously that one of our aspirations is to build a global company and to do we operate in the US, Canada and Australia and over time, over a long horizon, we will try to expand outside of these regions. Now as far as M&A goes, what I'd say is we look at all of the opportunities around us. And we're fortunate in that we've got the core business in the US that generates cash, and we can invest organically to build out our presence in the nation. To the extent M&A makes sense, it might be something we consider, but the bar is extremely high, just given that M&A frankly is a complicated matter and getting it right is difficult. So unless we've got absolute conviction that M&A is the right tool, we usually rely on organic mechanisms.
