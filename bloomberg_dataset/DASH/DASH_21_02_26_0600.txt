Thanks, Elaine [ph]. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 Earnings Call. I'm Andy Hargreaves, VP of Investor Relations. It's a pleasure to be joined today by DoorDash CEO and Co-Founder, Tony Xu; and CFO Prabir Adarkar. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements during this call, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results and guidance, strategy, long-term growth, and overall future prospects, as well as statements regarding litigation and regulatory matters.

Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data, or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Events that could cause our actual results and future actions of the Company to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set forth under the caption Forward-looking Statements in today's investor letter and are described in our risk factors, including in our SEC filings, including our final prospectus for our initial public offering filed with the SEC on December 8, 2020.

You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Also, note that the forward-looking statements we make on this call are based on information available to us and assumptions and beliefs as of today's date.

We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. During this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information regarding our non-GAAP financial results including a reconciliation of such non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in our investor letter which was furnished with our Form 8-K, filed today with the SEC and on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website, and an audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly after the call.

With that out of the way, I'd like to turn it over to Tony.

Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Thanks, Andy. And thanks, everyone, for joining our very first earnings call. 2020 really put into focus the mission of our company and why we started this journey seven-and-a-half years ago. We exist to grow and to empower local economies. As this is our first earnings call, I thought I'd give you a snapshot into how our team has executed this mission during the most critical of times, and I'll followed by sharing a few thoughts on where we are going as we hopefully soon emerge out of this pandemic. 2020 was a difficult year for all of our audiences. And our operations make great challenges and fit enormous uncertainty. While exhausting at times, I am proud that our team chose optimism, built plan, prepared for all scenarios, and executed 24/7 to ensure that we did our part achieving the best of our local communities.

As much of the work began in March 2020, a lot of the impact is carried into Q4. We prioritize safety by shipping no contact delivery, distributed more than 10 million units of PPE in the form of hand sanitizers, gloves, and masks, to Dashers, and we collaborated with merchants on tamperproof packaging. We prioritize Dashers health by offering affordable telehealth visit with doctors. Ensured financial assistance for those impacted by COVID-19, and just last week hosted our first webinar to provide Dashers with information about the vaccine. Equally important, we became a lifeline to millions of people who saw flexible earnings opportunities, especially after furloughs and other forms of job loss.

In Q4 alone, over 1 million Dashers earned over $2 billion in supplemental income on our platform. We reduced our commission by half to local merchants, an investment totaling over $100 million while funding national marketing campaigns to drive growth and added instant liquidity. We provided grants to more than nearly 2,000 local restaurants to help them adapt to the COVID winter. And by the end of Q4 2020, our analysis showed that the odds of surviving during the pandemic were 8 times better for merchants on DoorDash versus all U.S. restaurants. For consumers, we accelerated our entry into the convenience and grocery categories. From September to December, last year, we observed 95% growth in consumers who order from these new categories on the DoorDash marketplace.

Finally, we supported our community by donating free DashPass subscriptions to healthcare workers across the country and partnered with organizations like the New York City Department of Public Schools, United Way, and Feeding America to deliver food, groceries, and supplies to those most in need. Powering the delivery of 6.5 million meals to those in need during 2020. I want to thank all of our teams worldwide and the millions of consumers, Dashers, and merchants, who each stepped up in their own ways to navigate this pandemic. As we progress out of the pandemic, I thought I'd remind everyone of our long-term vision, which will take decades to build.

In order to grow and empower local economies, we plan to build a marketplace and platform to enable every brick and mortar business to compete in today's convenience economy.

The job of our marketplace is to grow a merchant sales and we aspire to bring all of your logistics to you in minutes, not hours or days. Today, most of our business is in the restaurants category, where we still see massive runway. We are investing to extend our category-leading position in the U.S., while doubling down on the momentum we are seeing overseas in Canada and in Australia. Outside of restaurants, we're excited about the early progress we're making after launching into the convenience and grocery categories. According to third-party data, DoorDash became the largest online convenience delivery platform in the U.S. in less than a year, demonstrating the extensibility of our platform. And this is just the beginning as we have a long way to go in building our marketplace to serve these and many other categories in the future.

The job of our platform is to empower a brick-and-mortar merchant to build their own digital channel. A path necessary too, but adapted to evolving consumer preferences before the pandemic, and a task certainly necessary to have survived COVID-19. This business is even more critical as we come out of the pandemic as consumers have only become more habituated to a convenience economy, aided by a possible longer-term trend towards working from home. Today merchants can use DoorDash Drive to offer on-demand and same-day delivery from their own digital channels. In cases where merchants don't have an online ordering solution, they can use DoorDash storefront, which enables them to participate in e-commerce and gives them a product that seamlessly ties to their back-of-house systems.

Over time, we will have to build even more products and services to enable merchants to run their digital business as effectively as we operate our marketplace. Underpinning our marketplace and platform is our maniacal focus on operating efficiency, where we believe best-in-class execution will results in an improving cost structure that unlocks further investment capital as we grow our scale.

With that, let me hand it over to Prabir.

Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout our history, we've been laser-focused on our four core constituents, merchants, consumers, Dashers, and our employees. And today, we are excited to welcome our fifth constituent, our shareholders. I want to take this opportunity to share how we manage the business and allocate capital. We're still early in our life cycle and believe we have substantial growth opportunities ahead of us. We intend to invest aggressively to pursue these opportunities. We're navigating capital, we start small, and experiment until we find product-market fit. If we see strong demand with the back to unit economics that meet our thresholds, we invest incremental capital.

Each project we invest in must continuously earn capital on its own merits. To date, the bulk of our investments have been made through our income statement rather than through our balance sheet. And we expect this to remain the case for the foreseeable future. We are the category leader in the US, but despite our scale, we see significant room for growth. Consequently, we're managing the business to maximize scale and long-term profit dollars, rather than take rate or margin percentages. In practice, this means we intend to invest aggressively into the business in order to further our growth initiatives and expand our competitive advantages. As you likely saw, we intend to provide guidance for marketplace GOV and adjusted EBITDA going forward.

We do not plan in guiding to revenue as we do not directly manage the business for this metric. In our model, revenues and output, reflecting in part dynamic decisions we make around consumer pricing, the ideal mix of advertising to promotions, our relative success with DashPass, and the mix of Drive orders. We focus intently on input in each of these areas, but we'll manage the business for marketplace GOV and adjusted EBITDA dollars. We provided our guidance for Q1 and 2021 in our investor letter, but I'd like to provide a little more detail behind that. Underlying our 2021 guidance is an assumption of accelerated market reopenings and a return to in-store dining.

While, we have seen many positive signals from consumers and markets that have temporarily reopened during the pandemic, we acknowledge that vaccination and full reopenings could drive sharper changes in consumer behavior than current data would predict. Consequently, our 2021 full-year guidance reflects this uncertainty. We are deeply hopeful that markets will reopen soon and we'll manage our business to provide exceptional experiences to merchants, consumers, and Dashers in any scenario.

With that, I'll open it up to questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Go ahead, sir.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First, just on trends a little bit in 1Q. We've seen some signs of accelerating growth in the quarter from some of your peers. Can you just talk about kind of what you're seeing in the first quarter and how that ties into your guidance for 1Q in terms of GOV. And then secondly, can you just talk more broadly about how you're thinking about the marketing and competition in the category, in the U.S., now that we've seen a degree of consolidation over the last year and reopening happening, and how you view kind of rationality in this space going forward? Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Hey, Doug. Maybe, I'll take that question. So, first, in terms of the first quarter, we're seeing acceleration in January relative to our order growth in December as well as in Q4. So -- that answers that question. Our findings are consistent with what others have communicated. With respect to marketing and competition around that, we continue to acquire more of the new customers joining the industry in any given period. And part of what's driving that is the consistent gains we drive in our unit economics and the retention and engagement of our consumer base, which then allows us to pay higher and higher amounts in terms of CPEs to acquire customers. And so, we believe it's a competitive advantage where our increasing unit economics help drive an LTV increase that then translates into an ability to acquire more customers than others.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Thank you.

Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.

Q - Ross Sandler{BIO 15948659 <GO>}
Hey, guys. Thanks for the chart in the letter about the marketplace versus the Drive partner, store growth rate. A question about the latter, so on Drive, I think order growth was growing around 700% in mid-2020 and looking at the take rate in the fourth quarter, might have slipped down a little bit. So just, is that true and what percent of orders are coming from Drive at this point? Just any thoughts on the long-term outlook for that business? That's it. Thanks a lot.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Hey, Ross. So, let me take the second part of the question for us, which is I think you were talking about take rate changes going from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. The third quarter take rate is 12.1%, which reduced to 11.9% in the fourth quarter. And really the two things driving that was incremental Prop 22 class -- number Prop 22 passed [ph] in November. And so we have a portion of the quarter during which we had to incur those costs as well as the impact of commission gaps or price controls in certain jurisdictions in Q4. So, those price controls that we even disclosed in the letter. The net impact on revenue from the price control was $36 million or 44 basis points. So if you add that back, you get a cleaner picture of what the actual underlying increase in the take rate was, inclusive of the Prop 22 cost.

On Drive, we continue to be excited by that business. Drive continues to grow strongly, faster than the core marketplace and Drive orders grew both quarter-on-quarter as well as year-on-year basis. The thing that's interesting about Drive is, about a year ago, we were largely concentrated in the restaurant vertical, but since then, we've diversified beyond restaurants and have now brought on to the Drive platform merchants and local businesses in other verticals such as UPL, we signed Michael's and Murphy's. In pet suppliers, we signed PetSmart and Petco. Within pharma delivery, Sam's Club, as well as Flowers [ph]. So we continue to be excited about the growth here. We haven't disclosed exactly what percentage of Drive orders took place in this past quarter.

But suffice to say, Drive continues to grow strongly, both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, and faster than the core business.

A - Andy Hargreaves{BIO 22556419 <GO>}
We can go to the next question, operator.

Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from JMP.

Q - Ronald Josey{BIO 16409770 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. And I wanted to ask a little bit more about usage. In the letter, I think you talked about improved retention from DashPass subs and DashPass subs grew, I think a bigger, larger part of the mix of orders. So can you talk about retention a little bit more, particularly as we think about January and trends going forward in terms of consumer behavior trends? And then, any sort of insights on DashPass usage and just frequency of use would be helpful? Thank you.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Hey, Ron. Yeah, in terms of DashPass, we haven't disclosed the number of subs. But, I will say that that they have grown sequentially since our disclosure of the S1. We continue to invest behind this because as we'd explained in our S1, DashPass drives improved engagement amongst the subscribers due to the zero delivery fees. And so, certainly an avenue for growth that's exciting to us. In terms of retention as well as engagement, we continue to see retention and engagement remain as COVID high is impacting engagement continues to improve both within the DashPass product as well as amongst non-DashPass users of the platform. So we're seeing positive trends there.

In terms of the long-term, in our experience, consumer behavior tends to be sticky. And so, once consumer has discovered DoorDash and if they ordered from their favorite restaurants and enjoyed the benefits of on-demand convenience, new habits get formed. And we believe this habituation will persist over the long run. And so, even when you look at markets like Texas, and Georgia, and Florida, that reopened, there was -- sort of partially opened even through the pandemic in the U.S., against that backdrop, we continue to see our weekly order volumes in these markets continue to grow.

So let's say, that's a promising sign. If I set your question as sort of heading into a guidance question, so maybe I will address that right now, which is, embedded in our guidance, we're assuming that as the vaccine gets fully rolled out and consumer behavior will start reverting back to pre-COVID levels. And so that's what's embedded in the guidance along with standard Q2, Q3 summer seasonality when people generally tend to go out versus order (inaudible). So you see that embedded in our guidance with a certain amount of uncertainty with respect to what consumer behavior does post-pandemic. And we're trying to reflect that in the guidance we've provided.

Q - Ronald Josey{BIO 16409770 <GO>}
Super helpful. And you read my mind. Thank you.

Operator
And your next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.

Q - Heath Terry{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
Great. I was wondering if you could give us a bit of an update on your experiments, it's probably more than an experiment, but you're -- the work that you're doing in general merchandise, the relationship with (inaudible), and others. What kind of progress you're seeing so far and to the extent that we just came out of the holiday season where companies like Nike were being told by third-party delivery networks that they couldn't ship through them. How you see the size of that opportunity in the face that you're going to try and address it?

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Hey. It's Tony. I'll take that question. If you can think of any silver lining under this pandemic, I think it is that every brick-and-mortar store, whether they are a restaurant or a retailer is participating in e-commerce, sometimes exclusively in e-commerce, given some of the restrictions that we saw during the past year. And for us, we're really were seeing that on both sides of our business as a marketplace as well as a platform. You know, in the marketplace front, we launched our second category of convenience item deliveries, about a year ago when we announced partnerships with 7/11, CBS, Walgreens, and many others.

And I mean, already that has picked up quite a lot of momentum in the early progress. Again, very early, but according to third-party estimates, DoorDash already is the largest delivery platform for convenience goods in the US and I think you're seeing some of the extensibility starting with the highest frequency category of restaurants, building the biggest audience there, and covering the most number of stores there, just given the nature of how many restaurants there are relative to how many other types of stores there are that have made us be able to accelerate very quickly into some of these other categories.

On the platform front, we've actually been delivering from a lot of these partners for a while. DoorDash Drive launched in 2017 Q1, so it's about four years old now. And I know Prabir mentioned some of the categories that really came into fruition in the past year, whether that be in retail as we partnered with the likes of Macy's and Michael's, Pet Supply, PetSmart, and PetCo, or pharmacy with Sam's Club. And so, I think what you're seeing is, every business recognizes that omnichannel is a great thing. Every business is trying to figure out how to redo their supply chains where it meets a post-pandemic omnichannel channel presence, which they expect to grow. And we'll be there with them, both with our marketplace as well as our platform.

Q - Heath Terry{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
Great. Thank you very much.

Operator
And your next question is from Eric Sheridan from UBS.

Q - Eric Sheridan{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Thank you so much for taking the question. I want to come back to the constrained investments against the longer-term opportunities. You've talked before about geographic expansion. Can you just give us a bigger sense of the way you're thinking now post the IPO about the process of either building businesses globally or acquiring businesses globally, and sort of puts and takes of both organic and inorganic growth outside your core markets? Thank you.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah. Hey, Eric. I'll take that one. Look -- to go on, if you think about our portfolio of investments today, we are growing our core category of restaurants, which we believe has massive runway ahead. We're adding categories to becoming a multimarket place -- multi-category marketplace. We are adding products in our platform, in addition to Drive and Storefront. And the fourth area is international. So, our perspective on international opportunities is really taking a very long-term view and becoming a global company over the long run. And given what we've seen even with our current footprint and Australia and Canada, where we believe we gained share in 2020 and saw improvements in our unit economics, we're really liking what we've seen with our playbook.

And, we also like what we see in terms of some of the geographic opportunities outside of the ones we're operating in, in terms of just how under-penetrated and how large some of these opportunities are, especially as we bring a multi-product portfolio into those geographies.

With respect to how we enter, obviously, we will look at any opportunities and weigh them against our own organic efforts. So far, we like our playbook and we will always seek to enter markets in a differentiated way for all of the (Technical Difficulty)

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
And I would just add to Tony's point. I mean, I want to make sure we don't lose sight and even within the core food delivery business, the runway for growth is massive. If you look -- if you compare just our GOV compared to the overall restaurant spend, we're a tiny fraction of that. So there's a lot of runway for growth, just in food delivery and (inaudible) you're back onto that in a new vertical such as convenience and grocery, and that further add addressable market. We're a tiny, tiny fraction of that. So, international, definitely an important part as an area where we certainly aspire to grow into. But even the core US business has many avenues for growth and we'd ultimately avail those opportunities.

Q - Eric Sheridan{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Thanks so much.

Operator
And your next question is from Alex Potter from Piper Sandler.

Q - Alexander Potter{BIO 16150582 <GO>}
Thanks, guys. Just a question to maybe follow on this -- the previous discussion we were just having there. But if you were to maybe, I guess, kind of divide management bandwidth, like the amount of brainpower you're spending on these different growth opportunities right now, the various different verticals within Drive, international. I know it's easy to just say they're all important but you go to bed at night, what are the things that you're thinking about most versus less?

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah, I'll take that. Look, certainly we have a full plate, and it's a broad surface area. And the goal was always over many decades to build both a marketplace and a platform in which we can transform every brick-and-mortar business. So that aperture is -- was why even seven-and-a-half years ago when we started the company. The way I tend to think about this is, it's less about which thing comes up I guess most often in my dreams, it's more, do we have the right leader and are we setting up that leader with the right cross-functional team for success?

And Prabir mentioned in some of the opening remarks, a lot of these projects that we're talking about, they're in very different stages of progression and we tend to invest cum measure it to what we see both in terms of achieving product-market fit as well as just where we are in the maturation of development of that market opportunity. So, it's not like, I guess -- it's making sure that we always have that portfolio of investments and making sure that so long as we have the right team and the right single-threaded focus on that area that the focus is really just on that execution and nothing else.

Q - Alexander Potter{BIO 16150582 <GO>}
Okay. And then, maybe, another question, kind of, on I guess, on the regulatory front. I studied some rumors, I guess, in the press of potentially talking to unions, nationally, in order to prevent sort of a state by state Prop 22 type fight -- legal fight. If you deal with unions one time nationally then maybe you can come to some sort of labor agreement and that's kind of a one-and-done setup. Is that accurate? Are you guys having discussions like that? What are the odds something like that actually happens? Thanks.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Well, I think it's important to start with what it is that we want to achieve with respect to anything policy when it comes to Dashers, and for us that always starts with what it is that Dashers want. And I think what you saw in Proposition 22 was that both politics and policy sided with the Dasher, both sides of the aisle in California came together to support Dashers' desire to keep the flexibility that frankly doesn't exist in any other type of work opportunity. And then pair that flexibility with greater security. And wherever there are opportunities to have discussions about how can we maintain this flexibility and really create a set of standards around it that gives portable and proportional benefits tied to -- tied to this flexibility?

We're happy to have those conversations. I mean, if you just look at some of the outcomes that have been achieved with Prop 22, I mean, you see a 50% increase in net promoter scores for Dashers post Prop 22 in the State of California. So, I think this is an instance where business and policy actually achieve the outcomes -- or the outcomes actually achieve the objectives that it set out to accomplish.

Q - Alexander Potter{BIO 16150582 <GO>}
Thanks very much.

Operator
And your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.

Q - Lloyd Walmsley{BIO 15125459 <GO>}
Thanks. Two questions, if I can? First, can you just give us an update on how you're approaching the incremental Prop 22 costs and -- how are they coming in versus your estimates? How are you passing along or not passing those along to consumers? And what are you seeing in the competitive environment that may inform what you do?

And then, I guess, the second would just be on kind of active efficiency talked about in the letter, and continuing to improve. Is there an opportunity and you feel like there is multiple years left, or are there other regions where you have strong density or other factors that might serve as a leading indicator, where you could give us a sense of more mature contribution margins or regional EBITDA margins? Anything you could share there would be great. Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Hey, Lloyd. Maybe, I will take that. So, closing terms of the Prop 22 costs, we're absorbing the vast majority of the Prop 22 costs. We are passing them along in certain instances, which are the vast majority of the cost in California, we're absorbing in our P&L. And if you think about why we're doing it, it's, first and foremost, in order to benefit merchants. Because if we keep prices low to consumers, consumers tend to order more, those orders ultimately benefit our merchants. And so to the extent we can continue doing so, we will. It also is consistent with our overall philosophy to manage the business, to maximize scale and top line growth, while maintaining discipline in DoorDash.

So, what's embedded in our guidance for Q1 and 2021 as a whole is an assumption that we're going to continue absorbing Prop 22 cost to the degree that we currently have. On your second question around active efficiency, I remember, we had this discussion even at the time of the IPO. Our active efficiencies continue to grow, obviously, year-on-year, but also on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And the reason for that is because active efficiency, one, simply a product of the traffic that's on the streets or the waiting time of restaurants. There's a ton of product work that goes into dispatching a Dasher to quickly ensuring Dashers are prepared while ensuring wasted time at the restaurant is eliminated, and so on. And so, we've not found the ceiling yet and I feel good about the fact that there's continued improvement in active efficiency where possible. But we don't have at least a view in terms of where it was actually to disappoint [ph].

Q - Lloyd Walmsley{BIO 15125459 <GO>}
All right. Thank you.

Operator
And your next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.

Q - Jason Helfstein{BIO 2527987 <GO>}
Thanks. I'll ask two. Just maybe how you're thinking about driving more adoption of Storefront. And obviously, there is a lot of out suites out there for SMBs, but yours integrate into your whole back-end. And so, maybe just talk about how do you drive that adoption? Is there certain pricing mechanisms you use or other ways to get that out there?

And secondly, could you maybe talk a bit more about kind of the caps in some of the pushback. I mean, number one, any information you can share about how non-chain restaurants are kind of increasing prices -- online prices to offset (inaudible). And just, in general, that behavior, I mean, the awareness that that's kind of a pretty healthy way to kind of manage. And then, can you see any way that permanent jurisdictional price caps are illegal? Thanks.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah. So, Jason, maybe I'll take the first part of the question over there. So, I think the first question was on Storefront. Look, Storefront is -- it's very early. It's a little over six months old as a product and it has grown extremely, extremely quickly since launch. And you're right, in some sense for merchants, it's a bit of a no-brainer because it already integrates with all of their back-of-house systems that we've had to do on our marketplace. On the flip side, there's a lot of work, has to be done, making sure that it works with a wide variety of merchants. We serve -- we're very privileged and proud to serve hundreds of thousands of businesses, but that also comes with lots of complexity in terms of their operations, their protocols, their reporting requirements, and things that so on and so forth.

And so, that's really where we are. And we're in -- back to how we think about investment horizons and how we manage capital allocation. Right now, Storefront is really in the product-market fit phase. And so, we're just trying to create more and more features such that it can deliver more and more of the benefits that we see in our own marketplace to a merchant's own digital channel.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
And Jason, just on your question regarding price caps, as of the end of Q4 we were subject to price controls in 73 jurisdictions, which is up from 32 at the end of the third quarter. Now, based on all the conversations we had with city officials, these price caps are temporary in nature, and they are all tied to emergency orders that are related to in-store dining. And so, it's our expectation that when in-store dining resumes, these price caps will fall away. In the interim, well regarding incrementing -- incremental consumer fees in order to recoup some of the costs related to the price controls, if you remember, in the long term our North star is to continue to do some consumer fees. And so, we will do this as long as price caps are temporary and the fee increases will go away once the price caps drop away.

And in Q4, those price caps had an impact of $36 million in terms of revenue or about 44 basis points on our take rate and we were planning to manage to back similar dollar impact over time. In terms of the relative payment price caps, I don't want to comment on hypothetical, but -- because these are all the comments relating to that so far, assuming this should be -- this will be temporary in nature.

Q - Jason Helfstein{BIO 2527987 <GO>}
Okay. And just if there is any -- anything you want to share about maybe proportion of restaurants that are using separate pricing for online versus in-store to try to recoup fees?

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yeah. Some (multiple speakers) restaurants are using menu inflation -- menu price inflation in order to recoup fees. So far, again, this may be a function of the fact that in-store dining shutdown and consumer price elasticity, the impact on price elasticity is relatively minimal. But we're hopeful that as in-store dining resumes, merchants will recognize that keeping prices consistent with their in-store is actually the right path forwards because it boosts the amount of demand that's possible to that delivery channel.

And your next question comes from Ralph Schackart from William Blair.

Q - Ralph Schackart{BIO 7200102 <GO>}
Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. First, just on the annual EBITDA guidance per (inaudible). That, you know, contemplates a fairly wide range change [ph] around $200 million or so. I know you talked about price controls, as well as Prop 22 but just can you give us a sense what would drive either outcome on the low-end or the high end, especially after coming off, obviously some strong tailwinds with COVID, but a strong 2020?

And then, just maybe a follow-up on the competitive side. You talked about cash being a little bit more expensive, but within your normal range, maybe just give a sense of how the supply side looks for drivers, and your ability to continue to add merchants, particularly in the restaurant side? Thank you.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Sure. Ralph, so on your first question regarding the guidance, really the objective within the guidance is to ensure some level of discipline on the EBITDA line to the extent that we're outperforming on the topline either due to the core food business or outperformance in products such as Drive or new verticals such as convenience, which would be towards the high end. On the other hand, we've got some amazing opportunities ahead of us, particularly with the trends [ph] to convenience. As you likely saw, third-party data shows us as being the leader in the online convenience space. And this is after having launched that particular vertical about a year or less than a year ago.

And so, if we start seeing incremental progress and positive signals from some of these new projects, including Storefronts and Drive, and other things, we're inclined to invest as long as it meets our return thresholds in which case we will likely end up towards the low end of that range. Again, we're managing the business, just as a reminder, to maximize scale and top-line growth with an intent to try to land inside the range in EBITDA as opposed to trying to beat EBITDA.

And on your second question, with respect to the supply side, let me talk to the merchants first. And with COVID and the recent pandemic, it became clear to merchants that they need a delivery channel. So merchants that weren't participating in delivery side of the pandemic, needed to get in our delivery platform quickly, and so, we saw a massive influx in terms of merchants, which unlike the selection growth, and you can see that in the chart that we include in the shareholder letter where the selection to get into the platform has continued to grow.

In terms of our cost to acquire merchants, they have been relatively stable. The same goes on the Dashers side, where we've had some of the (inaudible) little cities, on the one hand, you would have expected a large influx of Dashers as a result of heightened unemployment, but that was offset to some degree by stimulus checks. Regardless of all of that, our cost to acquire Dashers has been sort of stable and still within the line of what we expected.

Q - Ralph Schackart{BIO 7200102 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Prabir.

And your next question comes from the line of James Lee from Mizuho.

Q - James Lee{BIO 15949362 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. On the shareholder letter, you guys mention that consumer acquisition cost increased in 4Q. So, is that the trend we are expecting or you're expecting going forward? And second thing, how should we think about maybe contract revenue going forward into FY'21? Is that on a rising trend as well? And specifically on advertising, can you talk about maybe what channels are working along very well for you, what channel that you'd like to improve? Any particular region that you want to go after a little bit more aggressive? Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Maybe, I'll start with your first question on customer acquisition costs. To be clear, we manage our business to payback thresholds. And so the customer acquisition cost and the CPE that we pay in order acquire customers is simply an output resulting from a payback period that we're trying to sit. And so, to the extent that we continue increasing the LTV of our customer base through improved profitability, to improve engagement to lever such as DashPass, it gives us more flexibility to increase our CPE. So, I view our increase in CAC as a feature where we're able to fund higher and higher amounts of customer acquisition in order to acquire a larger and larger share of new customers joining the industry, which then when you couple that with our industry-leading retention, leads to continued market share gains in the future. So, the increase in customer acquisition costs are a choice that we're making to reinvest the profitability in our business.

On the question around contract revenue, just looking at 2020 versus 2021, the -- we don't guide to revenue, but I would point you to the fact that we have an incremental cost resulting from Prop 22 that didn't exist in 2020 for the most part. And so, you will see a detriment to our take rates in 2021 as a result of that incremental profitability cost, the vast majority of which we are -- we're choosing to absorb.

And lastly, the advertising front, again, we don't preference one channel over another, necessarily. We're managing the business through payback periods. And so, we will flexibly deploy capital across regions, across channels, as long as it fits our payback thresholds.

Q - James Lee{BIO 15949362 <GO>}

And your next question comes from the line of Michael McGovern from Bank of America.

Q - Michael McGovern{BIO 22700681 <GO>}
Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on maybe the trajectory of AOV versus total orders for the 2021 guidance with AOV down 5 points in the fourth quarter, do you kind of expect AOV to stay in the negative territory throughout 2021?

And maybe, if you could also talk a little bit about the cadence for -- on a quarterly basis, do you kind of just expect seasonality to return to maybe like a pre-COVID level in 2021, within normal bump in Q4? Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Sure. So, on the first question with respect to AOV, the first thing is to clarify it, if you take our GOV and divide it by our total orders, you know the VAT AOV compression in part is driven by the fact that our total orders includes Drive orders but the value associated with a Drive order is not contained in our GOV. And so, when you see deceleration in the AOV, some portion of that deceleration has been caused by an increasing mix of Drive orders. So, I want to make sure I clarify that.

Second, and you said that, if I just look at our marketplace orders alone, AOVs remain above pre-COVID levels, but not massively above pre-COVID levels. They've continued sort of normalizing over the course of 2020. They were at a high in Q2 and so -- continue normalizing since then.

But, they're still modestly above pre-COVID level and we expect continued moderation over the course of 2021. On the question on seasonality, what I'd say is what was embedded into our guidance is an assumption that the vaccine will be broadly available soon. And that, in short, I mean, they'll resume relatively soon. And as a result, starting from Q2 onwards, you're going to see a reversion towards pre-COVID behavior within the customer base, that includes reversion in terms of AOVs as well as all the frequency and that's compounded by the traditional seasonality you see around the summertime where order frequencies are impacted as consumers can get out more and go to restaurants a lot more.

To the extent the consumer behavior remains propped up as a result of -- or during [ph] the vaccine or other factors, obviously, we will perform to the upside.

Q - Michael McGovern{BIO 22700681 <GO>}
Got it. Thanks.

And your next question is from Youssef Squali from Truist.

Q - Youssef Squali{BIO 1506420 <GO>}
Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions from me, please. Starting with just your, I know you're not guiding to revenues per se, but since you are diving into GOVs, I was wondering as you look out, not just for 2021, but beyond, say, next five-plus years, how do you see your take rate over time evolving? Is there a point at which you kind of prefer not to have a go above a certain threshold because they just create too much friction with the client, with the consumers, with restaurants, and then, potentially even bring some jurisdictions even harder -- to pay a harder look at the G&A economics of the business?

And then, maybe, just looking at the business internationally. As you -- I know the focus is primarily on the U.S., Australia, Canada, but as you look beyond and there were some press articles about your interest in Japan, et cetera, can you just flesh out what you look at in terms of -- an attractiveness of the market? I think your main competitor talks about wanting to be number one, number two, and otherwise, they are not in that market.

I'm not seeing that many markets where people can still be a number one and number two, so maybe if you can just flesh that out for us a little bit your strategy around international expansion beyond this three -- the other two markets you're in? That will be great. Thank you.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Great. Hi, Youssef. So, let me take the question on take rate first, and then, Tony can talk about international. I think -- when we think of -- or when we look at our strategy long-term, the idea is to lower commissions and fees on merchants to lower fees on consumers and to increase DASH earnings. That's the simple sort of equation that we're trying to solve for. And the way we do that is by -- on the merchant side, as we unlock greater efficiency in the P&L, whether it's through active efficiency or it's through eliminating waste stages [ph] through reducing defect rates, and then help our customer support cost, and so on. We'll invest that both in on the merchant side as well as the consumer side. As an example, on the consumer side, as we keep increasing the adoption of DashPass, that has a natural deflationary impact on take rate, and although, a unit decrease decline, there are more than made up for by the increase in engagement amongst DashPass consumers.

And so, if you look at total revenue per MAU for a DashPass user versus somebody that doesn't use DashPass, the total dollars of revenue or total dollars of gross profit for a DashPass consumer tend to be higher than they do for non-DashPass consumers. So, we're actively choosing to make that trade-off. And so, over time, as we unlock these efficiencies in the P&L and as we provide merchants with additional products and services, the idea is to continuously reinvest those dollars into reducing merchant commissions, reducing consumer fees, and increasing Dasher earnings because it's our belief that as we continue doing so, it will enable more adoption and you'll have access to more of the TAM, that will ultimately translate into growth over the long run. Runs are [ph] good but sustained growth.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
And, hey, Youssef. On your second question around international, you know, (inaudible) is a little bit earlier. But for us, it's really taking a very long-term view, and otherwise, candidly, we would not have launched in the United States, either, as we were not the first player in 2013 when we founded the Company. And so, I think for us, it's really looking for areas of opportunity where we can bring something of unique difference, and then, taking a pretty long-term view on what it is that we can do for all of the audiences: consumers, merchants, and Dashers.

And I mean, if you look at some of the markets, well, frankly, even in the U.S., it's still pretty early days. The penetration levels are are quite low in these very large geographies, including those that have players already existing there. So, for us, it's always just obsessing over the consumer, merchant, and Dasher, and I think if we do that, our products will speak for themselves.

Q - Youssef Squali{BIO 1506420 <GO>}
Great. Thank you, both.

And our last question comes from the line of Samuel Lawrence from ARES.

Q - Samuel Lawrence{BIO 20114727 <GO>}
Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Two, please. So firstly, could you maybe talk a little bit about your testing in DashMarts? How you're thinking about the business model here and does this then bring the charts of those funds to -- in excess of your thresholds?

And then secondly, could you talk a little bit about your progression with order batching, and as you add new verticals, how do you envision this becoming more material in the longer term? Thanks.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah, I'll take the first question on DashPass. And I think, since Prabir talked earlier about active efficiency, I'll let him take the second question on batching. With respect to DashMarts, what we're super excited about the DashMart business, it's -- again, very early days, and we're turning into an experiments at the end of 2019, has been something that we've invested into 2020. And so, we're certainly seeing the rights, important metrics to cross our investment threshold in stage gates [ph] for further capital allocation. And really, as you think about the thesis behind DashMart, it's really bringing a selection to where it has not existed before. Whether that means getting merchants, it's really a win-win for merchants and consumers. For merchants, it gives them the opportunity to bridge into certain geographies that they may want to be in, but aren't currently in, in the depth or magnitude that they wish for consumers.

It's getting selection that they've never had before. I mean, for example, I mean if you think about restaurant tours, they also sell a lot of retail items, as an example, where in places like Chicago, we carry the sauces of chefs like Stephanie Izard and many others, in which we're serving the restaurants on DoorDash and Caviar, we're also now serving some of their other products through DashMarts. Equivalently, that's also happening in other categories as well where, again for merchants, this is an extension to bring them beyond their four walls, wherever they are. And for consumers, it's giving them selection that they've never had access to before.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yeah. And, Samuel, on your question on batching, batches have been relatively consistent for the last -- since Q2. And so, I want to make sure that we don't assume that batches are the only driver in active efficiency and the efficiency of the logistics network. There's several other sources from a product perspective, that we -- we make progress on, which is what led to the consistent and sequential increases in active efficiency, over the course of the past year. It's things like eliminating wasted time, that our Dasher spends in a restaurant. It's rather predictions of kitchen prep time to ensure the Dasher that will show up in the restaurant, (inaudible) then the food might be ready, and so on, and so. So, Dasher [ph] rates are obviously an important source, where they are [ph] the only source.
