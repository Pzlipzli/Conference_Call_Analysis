Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the DoorDash Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions)

Andy Hargreaves, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.

Andy Hargreaves{BIO 7538434 <GO>}
Thanks. Hello, everybody and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm pleased to be joined today by co-founder, chair, and CEO, Tony Xu; and CFO, Prabir Adarkar.

We'd like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements during this call, including our expectations of our business, future financial results and guidance, strategy and statements regarding the recently announced acquisition of the Wolt transaction results. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, and some such risks are described in our risk factors, including in our SEC filings, including Form 10-K. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information regarding our non-GAAP financial results, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in our investor letter, which is available on our IR site. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of the call will be available on our website shortly after the call ends.

And with that, we can go straight the questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.

Q - Douglas Anmuth{BIO 5591566 <GO>}
Thanks for taking the question. I know you're focused on maximizing the long-term profit dollars, should you please provide some more color on how to think about the near-term investment and loss levels in some of the new categories just relative to the profit and cash generation that you mentioned in the core restaurant business? Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Hi Douglas, Thanks for the question. Yeah, that's right. We are focused on maximizing scale and the reason for that is because we operate in very large categories that are underpenetrated today. What I'd say is, we're not breaking out the margins of the investments in our new categories other than to say that the US business is growing nicely and has an increase in contribution margins both on a quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year basis.

So that increase in profit is what we're funding into these investments and we're watching for core signals around retention in order frequency to make sure they hit on thresholds.

Q - Douglas Anmuth{BIO 5591566 <GO>}
Okay, thank you.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Trust Securities. Your line is open.

Q - Youssef Squali{BIO 1506420 <GO>}
Great, thank you very much. Two questions from me, please. One, did you guys see any benefits from omicron during the quarter and how has January and early February trended versus your expectations?

And second, can you maybe speak to recent trends and the competitive landscape? And do you believe your main competitor has been talking about that you guys may have lost some share in the US and if so, maybe just if you can flesh that out for us in terms of GEOs and product types where you feel you need to maybe regain some share? Thank you.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
So maybe I'll side the omicron question and then Tony can chime in with the competitive landscape. On omicron specifically, the impact in Q4, even January has been relatively muted. It's not significant that I would call it out, and certainly not significant when compared to the impact we saw from COVID in -- early in Q2. In fact, we have a been sort of successive value, and the impact on our business basically diminished. And so the Q4 outperformance, I wouldn't attribute that to omicron.

And Tony, if you want to comment on the competitive landscape?

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah, hey Youssef, we actually haven't noticed any share loss in any time period recently in the fourth quarter or for the year of 2021 and I think when you think about maybe why this is, it really just breaks out into, I think, basic math, right. On new customers, we continue to be the leading acquirer of all customers that come into the industry for the first time.

And then when you think about the possibility of new customer acquisition, especially just given how deep some of these channels are, they are really deeper than any other possible channel in which you can acquire new customers into the industry.

I think the second part of how you can gain share certainly is just, what is the retention and order frequency of these customers and we continue to have leading retention and order frequency in the category. And this has always been our focus by the way, which is to make sure that we build the best product which you can see is demonstrated through these leading both new customer acquisition as well as retention metrics.

And as a result, when I think about just, if this ties a little bit, I think the previous question that Doug was asking, just how large the core business opportunity is in US restaurants. The fact that even as the share leader and continuing to be the fastest-growing part of the industry, we're only 5% of US industry sales. And I think when you look at all of our active users while we had a record quarter of 25 million monthly active consumers, we're a single-digit percentage of the populations that we serve and certainly as you start adding into some of these new categories, as well as international geographies and there is the platform side of what we do with products like a Drive and Storefront, I mean we are a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the opportunity in front of us and that's why we're very excited about in investing.

But that said, in terms of how we view the future besides staying disciplined in terms of how we make investments, it's -- the first and foremost starts with making sure that we have the best product, which is going to offer the best combination of selection, quality, affordability, and service. And so long as we continue doing that, I think the scoreboard will continue taking care of itself.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
And just to add to Tony's point Youssef to answer your question directly, over the last 12 months, we've gained 2 points of share -- over 2 points a share count of third-party data sources. And specifically with respect to Q4, we believe we've gained share as we do faster than our peers, based on their publicly reported numbers for the US businesses.

Q - Youssef Squali{BIO 1506420 <GO>}
Great, thanks for the color.

Operator
Your next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open.

Q - Ross Sandler{BIO 15948659 <GO>}
Hey, guys, two questions. So is there anything unique about the experience thus far in Canada and Australia that gives you confidence that once the Wolt comes into the fray that you'll be able to run the same playbook success? I think there's some skepticism in the investment community that what you see in the US is replicable in these international countries. So maybe just talk a little bit about that?

And then, Prabir, your sales and marketing expense was actually down a bit quarter-on-quarter in contrast to the GOV being up nicely. So I think the letter mentioned customer acquisition being a little bit more efficient. Can you elaborate a little bit on that? Is that some of that retention, you're talking about kicking in or you know, that anything else on marketing efficiency? Thanks a lot.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Why don't I take the first question on some of our performance and progress internationally, and then I'll have Prabir to take the second question on the sales and marketing expenses.

With respect to our international progress, I mean we're super excited in what we've seen. And that's why we're only continuing to invest more there. And again, it starts with how do we find product-market fit and then how do we actually scale up our investments appropriately given what we're seeing. And what we see is, increased selection that we're offering customers, better quality of experience, more -- greater and greater affordability levels, especially with our investments through programs like DashPass and better service levels.

As a result, we're seeing higher order frequencies, higher retention, increased engagement with some of our new categories as well in these countries. And so that's really what we're seeing from customers and frankly, their voice as well as their -- how this, you know, choose to spend their dollars is really what informs us and guide us. And so we're only seeing progress there.

And I think, those inputs are what has translated into certain output, such as our revenue growth, order growth category, share growth, all of these things. So I think once we've mailed these inputs, that's why you're seeing the growth of the investments behind them and that's why we're also really excited about the Wolt partnership because we will get to do this on a bigger scale across over 20 countries.

And Prabir, you want (multiple speakers).

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yeah, And just to finish up that point. I mean, there's obviously been category share that you alluded to. But in addition, I mean, we stay super disciplined when it comes to these investments. That's what's allowed us to grow the US business and we're playing the same rigor to what is new categories or international and we are seeing margin improvements. And so that allows us to invest more with greater confidence. So let me just conclude that point.

And on your question on sales and marketing. The reason why sales and marketing declined, was because our driver acquisition costs or Dasher acquisition cost were lower quarter-on-quarter. As we've said in earlier quarters with fixed the under-supply situation that we faced earlier in Q2 and we find ourselves well supplied and we expect to be well supplied in 2022 and the big reason for that is because the people that generally become Dashers, that a very different audience than the types of people that the other gig economy companies are competing for.

So specifically, I think we said over 90% of Dasher said they have no plans to drive for rideshare and only 4% of the preferred -- rideshare compared to food delivery and so the reasons for that is because you don't need a car to Dash. You can dash scooter. You can dash on a bike. It tends safer because we're not sharing your personal space within the human being. So as a result of that, it's a very different audience that we can go after. And because we find ourselves well supplied, those Dasher acquisition costs is resulting favorable marketing costs decline quarter-on-quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.

Q - Deepak Mathivanan{BIO 17464056 <GO>}
Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Few questions from us. So first, Tony, in 2021, you guys launched a lot of new offerings and expanded across many verticals. The pace of innovation was pretty strong. But as we think about '22 and maybe even '23, what are one or two main initiatives you feel is ready to graduate and kind of become more meaningful on financial KPIs in the next 12 to 24 months?

And then the second question maybe for Prabir, seems like MAU was up 20% last year and frequency was also up pretty nicely. But as we think about your guidance, 19% year growth at the high end for the full year. How should we think about the assumptions for MAU growth frequency and AOE for this year? Thank you.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah, hey, Deepak, on the first question, I appreciate the comments on product innovation. We're always trying to accelerate that especially when we hear signals from how we can serve customers better, whether they'd be consumers merchants or Dashers. So we're constantly trying to increase the pace when we see that opportunity and only until we find product-market fit, do we actually scale them into a fairly large business.

Then I think we've had a track record of doing this and how whether it's certainly our core US restaurants business then building products on our platform like DoorDash Drive, as well as Storefront. We're the leading category player in the convenience category, in the pickup category. We've taken business as pretty much from scratch in these new categories that convenience grocery and other categories from zero into now billion dollar plus scale businesses, that 14% of our monthly active users spent time in. So I think there has been a lot of progress to your point.

In terms of -- just focusing on one or two things where we tend to do is, our investment philosophy is really -- it starts with building the best product. And so long as we like what we're seeing from a product-market fit perspective and we're constantly trying to make every detail right within each one of these categories, then do we stage gate further investment into growing these whether it'd be into new geographies, into more merchants. We doubled the number of non-restaurant partners for example in our marketplace in 2021.

But we have a lot of work to do. And so the way I think about it is, so long as we stick to our investment philosophy of making sure that we've built the best possible product as measured by our retention and order frequency and we stay disciplined and how we can scale them not just with capital, but frankly, with the right leaders place in these initiatives as well as the right team allocated to those leaders, we'll be in a great spot.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
And then, Deepak, on your question around '22 and obviously the longer-term outlook. Look, simply is to goal is to increase NAUs and to continue driving the order frequency. We don't run the business on a one-year block and we think about planting seeds for many, many years in the future. So the way to think about it is, these categories, really the food categories are under-penetrated in that core business and our client run rate were less than as Tony alluded to 5% of the total US restaurant sales.

And so even in core food, the significant room for continued adoption and engagement increases. Now You add to that, these other categories that were made initial for even to whether it's convenience, grocery, alcohol, packed food, retail and so on. These have a massive market that are also in lower -- lesser penetrated compared to the food category.

So we put these two things together. It's an exciting opportunity set ahead and basically signals that we're seeing in terms of early adoption and engagement as we transition from being food delivery app to basically all of your -- serving all of your local commerce needs. It gives us confidence and sustain a healthy growth for a long period of time.

Q - Deepak Mathivanan{BIO 17464056 <GO>}
Got it. Okay, thanks, Prabir. Thanks, Tony.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Boone with JMP Securities. Your line is open.

Q - Andrew Boone{BIO 18466066 <GO>}
Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. Two please. One, can you just update on your progress on advertising and can that contribute to 2022 or is it a longer-term initiative?

And then secondly on non-restaurant verticals. where are you seeing traction with consumers? Is it grocery, is it alcohol? Can you be a bit more specific there? Thank you so much.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Sure. I'll take both of those and feel free to add Prabir. On the first question around advertising. We're seeing tremendous excitement, pretty much actually from all of the stakeholders from advertisers, from retailers, from restaurants, from consumers, and to me what's really important is making sure that we can achieve two objectives, which sometimes can come at odds with one another.

One is how do we offer the best return and advertiser return in terms of their return on spend. And the second is, how do we make sure that we certainly not degrade, but ideally improve the consumer shopping experience. And these are the two things that we're constantly focused on. And so we're in no rush to monetize although we're really excited by what we're seeing. But these are kind of our objective functions, if you will, when it comes to advertising. It's doing really well as up to a tremendous start there is extraordinary demand. But I think staying disciplined on again building the best possible product to allow us to have these long-term sustained periods of growth is what -- it's how we think about this.

With respect to I think the new categories, we're actually seeing traction within each category, and I think in some regards this is probably not a surprise. I mean just think about some of these categories, whether it's things that you are stocking up in your pantry or grocery shopping or everything in between, I mean, these are the highest frequency possible categories when it comes to consumer spend and all were really doing is, I think adding to the incremental demand on one side by making sure that customers can get things delivered in minutes, not hours or days. And then on the other side, we're enabling these retailers and merchants to be able to do it through their own channels, their own apps, their own websites.

And so I think for those reasons, that's why we're seeing this growth. I mean, I think, as you saw in our shareholder letter, on an aggregate basis, about 14% of our monthly active shoppers have shopped in a category outside of restaurants, but that number is substantially higher than that and hundreds of markets already. And so -- and this is pretty universal across categories.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
And Andrew, just on your -- just go back to the advertising question, we are expecting advertising revenues to grow in 2022. But we will invest those incremental profits into the growth initiatives with the maximizing long-term profit dollars.

Q - Andrew Boone{BIO 18466066 <GO>}
Great, thank you.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Q - Eric Sheridan{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Thanks so much. Maybe just dovetailing with some more we talked about so far. As you move into more categories and you think about more product evolution of the long-term, I think in the shareholder letter, there was a comment about retention and frequency and LTV. How should we be thinking about the long-term margin structure or the long-term LTV, the CAC in this business now versus maybe the pre-pandemic period when you IPOed a couple of years ago? And how would you frame what you've learned over the last couple of years with respect to that? Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Thanks for the question, Eric. Just to -- let me take that question. The first thing I'd say is, what we shared in the letter was meant to be a framework for how we think about -- how we manage the business. So today we're not managing the business to a certain margin. We're not trying to increase margins quarter-on-quarter. We're not going to manage the absolute amount of EBITDA.

Instead, what we do is, we invest and we invest in areas, we start small and we look for signals along two dimensions. The first is product-market fit. So we alluded to the fact that 14% of NAUs use verticals outside of food. That's a signal about the market, and looking forward to frequency segment. We're looking for the impact of initiatives and actions we take on retention on the core platform, whether it's a [ph]little to core platform. If we see product-market signals, that's one criteria that's been met.

The second is that we are making progress on unit economics and we have a view for each business, what target unit economics need to be in order to meet our return thresholds. And so we're looking for steady progress. When you see both of these things, like we have with our new verticals, like we had with our international business and with our platform business, that's when we start scaling up our investments.

And so that's the framework we generally use versus trying to target a certain margin. The reason we included that example in the shareholder letter was to provide a case study of how we think about it, because if you were trying to grow margins period-on-period, a product like DashPass would never come to be. It just wouldn't because on each order DashPass has the lower unit margins. But as we said on the beginning, If you're optimizing for long-term profit dollars and we have confidence in the increasing order frequency of the DashPass program, as a result, the total dollars we can generate per user on the platform, are higher compared to the alternatives.

And so I'm not avoiding the question legitimately because we aren't running the business to certain target margins. We would be happy with the progress we're making on maximizing long-term profit dollars.

The one thing that gives me further confidence or sort of room for upside is the advertising opportunity, right. The advertising opportunity only grows as our users and our engagement grows and today compared to year ago with the 20% more NAUs compared to several years ago with three-four times the size of our business, and these individuals are engaging with us, not just in the restaurant vertical, because all of these different but other verticals and over multiple services within the app, which then gives us a tremendous opportunity to not just create new business lines, but also generate advertising revenue with the healthy royals.

And so I think of that as upside to the model. It's not something that you should be concerting in the near term because we need to be very careful about how we not just enable [ph]advertising related but do so in a way that doesn't degrade the consumer experience.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
The only thing I'd add to what Prabir said is really, I think the latter part of the question around what have we learned kind of during the pre-COVID -- kind of post COVID, behavior, it's just the resilience of the category and how I think we've put to rest, I think this question of what happens to demand as diners go back and you didn't cite restaurants. Well, I think clearly take out and delivery, as shown by our performance not just in the fourth quarter but also in 2021 just -- and an aggregate is that, they are complementary. It's very possible to eat inside of a restaurant and get delivery. Because we eat three times or more maybe per day and that's over 100 shopping moments per month and then you start adding these other categories and you just ask yourself the question, well, the complementary to go inside shopping malls or other types of stores and maybe get it delivered online or over the Internet, and I think that's kind of what we've seen certainly in the restaurant delivery business, and we're starting to see that in all of our other categories.

Your next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan with Needham and Company. Your line is open.

Q - Bernie McTernan{BIO 19139802 <GO>}
Great, thanks for taking the question. I've seen some examples on the app when I order dinner for example, may push me to order ice cream from another local store. I imagine new categories like grocery and alcohol can be probably incrementally less time-sensitive. So there's probably even a greater opportunity for Dashers to go to multiple storage for the same customer, but is that a substantial opportunity either from a cost-efficiency perspective or higher GOV or maybe some potential advertising opportunity?

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Hey, it's Tony. Yeah, I'll take the question. I think it's a really good point. And I think that's kind of really is very exciting for us because the thesis we've had since really day one at the company, which is, this business anything last mile and local commerce is really about building greatest order density. That's why we started with restaurants, right. It has the highest count of stores across every category of local retail restaurants that is, and it has the highest frequency of use, which is -- what gives you the possibility for the highest order density.

And if you can start with the highest order density, then you have a lot of optionality to do some of the things that you described to bring other types of things and I think hopefully being useful to consumers and different kinds of merchants, which therefore provides more flexible work opportunities for Dashers. It also provides opportunities to do -- I think some of the things you described around logistics efficiency, but to us, it's just -- again, it goes back to how do we become more and more useful in people's lives, right? How do we solve more jobs for a consumer? As we think about every shopping occasion, they have and again, while we have impressive order frequency, it's a small fraction of actually how much shopping that actually takes place, right,

So we have a lot of work to do, I think to solve even more jobs, and I think the same is true for merchants and not only in helping them build their channels, but doing other types of jobs for them. That's why we have our platform services business. And I think together If we can do these two things, we will provide the greatest number of work opportunities for Dashers as well.

And so you're absolutely right. And I think a lot of the assumptions behind the question, but to us, it just starts with how do we build the best possible experience consulting the most number of jobs.

Q - Bernie McTernan{BIO 19139802 <GO>}

Your next question comes from Michael McGovern with Bank of America. Your line is open.

Q - Michael McGovern{BIO 19951649 <GO>}
Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could dig a little bit more into the chart about DashPass order mix versus contribution profit per active consumer. It was pretty surprising and interesting to see that there is such a wide variance of DashPass order mix and also the contribution dollars. So I was wondering what causes some cohorts to lag? And then is it kind of just a function of time to get those lagging cohorts up to that close to $25 mark of contribution profit per active consumer? Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Thanks for the question, Mike, and a good opportunity to explain exactly what the chart mean as we got a few questions. I had to a call, So each dot on the chart is a quarterly cohort. So each -- this quarterly cohort starting from 2019, all the way through to the third quarter of 2021. And along the X-axis is the percentage of the orders from that cohort that are DashPass orders. On the Y-axis is the queue -- is the in-quarter, the Q4, 2021 contribution profit per active user in that quarter, for each of these cohorts.

And as you can see, this positive correlation where the higher the DashPass order mix, the higher the contribution profit per MAU. And it goes back to the answer I gave to Eric to his question which is, with DashPass, we're making a trade off to accept lower unit margins in exchange for significantly higher order frequency.

And so as the order frequency increases, you generate more orders and those orders translate into greater cumulative contribution profit for each user. Now to your question on what drives the variance, it's largely time. On the left side of this chart, are basically newer cohorts. The right side of this chart are older cohorts. And, So generally as time goes by, people -- consumers get increasingly (inaudible). They start using the product and, you know, DashPass that's making financial sense because once you start losing more than two, 2.5 orders, the borrower pays for itself.

And so what you see is overtime, as you -- as consumers save more money, they start using the DashPass, they have been for the drives up their order frequency.

Q - Michael McGovern{BIO 19951649 <GO>}
Got it. That's really helpful. I guess one quick follow-up on order frequency. I was just wondering, and on the 14% of customers that are now trying non-restaurant ordering for the first time or excuse me, just using it. Do you expect that restaurant and non-restaurant can exhibit similar order frequency trends long-term or do you think that you know, eating and ordering from restaurants is fundamentally a higher-order frequency you kind to market?

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
In general, people's activity in our -- on our app resembles how they operate in their daily lives, right, So if you think about -- this question came up sort of few quarters only went public around the mix between national brand, restaurants versus local restaurants. And frankly it replicates what you see in the industry. Similarly with areas such as convenience and grocery and alcohol and pet food, essentially overtime as people's awareness of DoorDash builds, and as our selection builds in the neighbors where they live in, their behavior offline and online will converge.

Today it's lower because that level -- we're still making progress in terms of the selection, quality, affordability paradigm in order to hit the sweet spots that more and more consumers start becoming aware of DoorDash as an on-demand wait actually get access to these verticals that are adjacent to food delivery and the ones that they use. So short answer to your question is, overtime, I expect the order frequency to basically to make how people shop in their daily lives.

Q - Michael McGovern{BIO 19951649 <GO>}
Got it. That's great. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is open.

Q - Lloyd Walmsley{BIO 15125459 <GO>}
Thanks. I have a couple if I can. First just, thanks for sharing the updated cohort data. If we just focus on maybe the narrower subset of users added during the pandemic, do you see consistent frequency and retention on those newer cohorts compared to older cohorts, and in particular in markets that have reopened more than others and anything you can kind of share on how you think that's going to play out over the rest of this year in terms of the cohort behavior and what's embedded in the guidance?

And then secondly, on grocery, at the time of the IPO, I think there were still some question marks around the unit economics and scalability of grocery. As you guys have progressed and learned in that category, how do you feel today about your ability to generate attractive unit economics and how is that informing, how you go to market on the grocery side? Thanks.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Great. So the first thing, let me just say that the retention pre-COVID versus COVID, right -- we are in the middle of COVID in 2020, retention spiked. It was at all time highs. Right. And then from there on in 2021 you start to see a slow normalization to retention, especially the vaccination rates increased and in-store dining resumed. We're at a point now where -- and by the way in 2021, early on in 2021, we were bolstered by the effect of stimulus payments that had an upward impact on both retention and order frequency.

Where we're at today is still better than pre-pandemic levels. But the retention has now normalized. We're slightly above pre-pandemic levels but not substantially. Order frequency substantially higher compared to pre-pandemic levels as well as 2020 levels, but that's because of continued improvements to order frequency both within the DashPass cohorts as well as the non-DashPass cohorts.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah. And on the second question around grocery, I mean, here's like, the way we think about it right, I mean, when you look at our portfolio of priorities, we have the US core business, a restaurant delivery. We have these new categories, one of which you're referencing, grocery, platform services, international and advertising.

The way we think about them is really how are we doing against their life stage, right. Obviously, a lot of these businesses performed actually quite recently product like grocery, for example, is only about 12 to 14 months old. We love the trajectory of the business, both top and bottom line, but it's still in its early inning and so right now the focus continues to be making sure that we keep improving the product experience, the selection of partners that we can bring on and the inventory from these partners, the quality of the experience itself, the affordability of these deliveries, as well as the service levels.

And so that's really the focus right now on grocery. And again like the way we think about making these investments is in a fairly disciplined way of making sure that we find product market fit before we actually scale to these things out. And so when we do scale these things out, they tend to already have very, very robust unit economics and cohort performance.

Your next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Your line is open.

Q - James Lee{BIO 15949362 <GO>}
Great, thanks for taking my questions. My question is on DashMart. Maybe can you guys talk about the expansion plan, maybe for FY22 and what the key learnings so far? And just curious, what do you need to see for this business, the scale, will you consider M&A or partnership to expand this segment? Thanks.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah, hey, James, it's Tony. So on DashMart, we really like what we see. Again, like this is another one of these newer initiatives about a year and a half old and what we're learning, I think our benefits really for -- starting with a couple of audiences and I'll talk about how it translates into [ph]for audience.

So first for consumers, a lot of these DashMart are just bring selection of inventory into geographies where frankly didn't previously exist. Whether literally never existed or the hours of operation is now open pretty wide 24/7 now, which is a big a improvement for what consumers are seeking. I think with respect to merchants, this is a critical infrastructure for a lot of them either to expand into new geographies or to increase into different hours of operations.

And so what we see is really DashMart on a fairly long investment time horizon, again, staying disciplined around finding product market fit before we choose to scale these things out. But what we're seeing is quite a lot of demand for them and I think it really speaks to, again, what we're trying to create at DoorDash which is really the largest local commerce app or marketplace where we're bringing incremental demand and the largest local commerce platform where we're building tools and infrastructure, obviously starting with delivery with products like DoorDash Drive.

But if you think about all the other products and services that merchants need to build in order to compete digitally in today's economy, well, it's certainly expand far beyond just the logistics and so DashMart are really a form of infrastructure, to store inventory, to possibly enter new geographies and certainly expand the hours of service.

And so we plan on investing in this line of work for a really long time, you know, for those reasons and obviously, if we can build both a marketplace and a platform with DashMart, I think it provides tremendous work opportunities for Dashers. But again, the investment philosophy stays the same, given how young DashMarts are. It's making sure that we have great product market fit and then we'll continue to scale them.

Q - James Lee{BIO 15949362 <GO>}
And one quick follow-up question Tony, here. When you look at the non-restaurant business in general, two parts of this question. We look at user behavior, do they tend to be more recurring in nature? Are they more impulsive?

And also second for your non-restaurant business in general, can you be profitable overtime without advertising?

Q - Youssef Squali{BIO 1506420 <GO>}
So on the non-restaurant category where we're seeing is pretty much quite a lot of different kinds of use cases. Are there people who just shop for impulse purchases for whatever the occasion might be? Yes. But predominantly we're seeing people come back for I think a lot of use cases. I mean, where the recurring behavior is looking for it, that middle of the week run now being solved by somebody else. Right.

That's really the job that we're solving for a lot of these customers, right. Like when you think about the items in your pantry, they get consumed the earliest or the items in your refrigerator that maybe perished the earliest, those are the things that actually -- those are the types of things where you have to go back in a week, about how much you buy on a weekly basis, right. And those are the jobs where people have to do every single week.

And so we are seeing certainly both with -- although more of the behavior is recurring, and then I'll let up Prabir take, I think your second question, which is really around I think, the business model.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
James, we have not disclosed anything about the business model around non-restaurant verticals and so no comment on that question.

Q - James Lee{BIO 15949362 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.

Q - Mark Mahaney{BIO 3027058 <GO>}
Okay, thanks. Two questions. When you think about the number of DashPass members now, you have it over 10 million out of whatever 25 million MAUs, what do you think are the obstacles to getting that penetration higher? I know it's high 40%. But I would think, given the value prop and the frequency of the activity, that that could get into 60%, 70%, maybe long-term. So what's -- what are the biggest things you have to solve for in order to get that penetration higher?

And then any quick updated comments on Prop 22 and I know there was the AG reversed store challenge, the judge's decision that earlier this month. Any updated thoughts on how that's going to play out or when we will know? Thank you.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah. Prabir, you want to take the first.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yeah, I want to take the first one and you take the second one. Okay. So, Mark, on your question on the 10 million out of 40. Yes, the 10 million was a milestone. We are happy with its 40% of our MAUs. But there's a lot of runway, right. And if you think about -- I mean, with 25 million MAUs were a small fraction of the US population.

Now add in the other countries we operate in, whether it's Canada, Australia, Japan, Germany, when we have access to 500 million people, right. And so in the context of that 500 million people, if you adjust for that, for adult and so on, the 10 million membership size is a small fraction.

So the path to get there is going to be back to the basics of selection, quality, and affordability. So in selection as we keep adding these new categories and new stores into these neighborhoods, that cross-sell percentage, the 14% will start creeping up and order frequency in these new verticals will increase, given the point I made earlier about purchase behavior on our platform ultimately mimicking or reflecting how human beings operate in their daily lives.

So overtime as order frequency increases, the seamless opportunity increases and DashPass starts making sense. So even if someone that doesn't order enough restaurant delivery today, overtime DashPass may end up making sense for them because they use DashPass to order the convenience goods or the grocery goods or the liquor purchase, the pet food or retail and so on so forth. So there is an opportunity in that front and there is an opportunity for to continue improving quality.

Today we've made consistent improvements, but still a reasonable number of deliveries are effective and so we've got a bunch of work to do to make the product reliable 100% of the time. So that if you are a DashPass member, the experience truly feels special.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah. And Mark, with respect to your second question on Prop 22, nothing has changed, I mean, we still think we are absolutely right on the law here. In fact, I think even the California Attorney General has supported us in this regard. That when 58% to 59% of the state population and building population are saying that they passed something into law, that should be legalized. I think it's just common sense. That's the right legal answer.

But I think even more importantly than this, just more broadly speaking, we feel the same way about this issue anywhere in the sense that drivers in this type of economy ought to be able to take wherever they want to work, whenever they want to work and that flexibility is critical. I mean that's what Prop 22 stands for while giving them the protection that they deserve and we whether it's -- can say the California or frankly any geography globally, that's what we stand for, which is the support the Dasher and the voters of California believe in this. The drivers believe in this. And the California Attorney General believes in this.

Your next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.

Q - Brad Erickson{BIO 18494007 <GO>}
Thanks. Just a couple, I guess. First, between the different categories, all the different categories you have going here in the US and then obviously Wolt coming on here later this year, hopefully, and then, Canada and Australia. Does all of that expansion, I guess right in front of you probably keep you from say exploring other international expansion, or should we assume other markets are sort of always under exploration?

And then second, if you think about the regulatory work likely to occur, if not in the future, if not already in your, you know, lot of these international markets, talk about just kind of how prepared you feel you are in terms of personnel and the associated expense necessary to kind of support those works and hopefully constructive dialogs? Thanks.

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah, hey, it's Tony. I'll take both of those questions. With respect to the first, I think you're certainly right in saying that we have quite a lot on our plate and we're constantly again trying to invent the best possible products and again, when you think about the portfolio of initiatives of US restaurants, new categories, our platform services international markets and advertising, there is a lot of work to go around.

So, we always believe that we have to earn the right to serve customers in a second way by doing an excellent job in a first way and so that's really what we're focused on. But look, I mean, it doesn't mean that we're not scanning for opportunities. We're always looking for opportunities regardless, -- and especially when we have such a robust core business that's producing positive cash flow and with the very healthy balance sheet, it gives us lots of opportunities to be opportunistic and go on the offensive.

I think with respect to your second question around regulatory preparation, yes. I mean, I think this has been something that's been a part of DoorDash really since 2013 when the company was founded. And these beliefs that we've had since day one of making sure that workers should be able to have this new standard where they get the flexibility that they're telling us over and over again with their words as well as with their feet. And also the protections that we believe they deserve and frankly just like expire outdated laws that deserve to be expired.

And we think the productive way in doing this like governments and businesses such as ourselves, should work together across any geography to make sure that this actually happens, from the perspective of the worker not from any other perspective. And so that's what we're working really hard on and we have best-in-class teams to get that work done.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.

Q - Brian Fitzgerald{BIO 15325680 <GO>}
Thanks, guys. A couple of questions on the marketplace side of things. Non-restaurant partners doubled '21 clearly have a lot of runway there and you have a focus on product-market fit for scaling. But how do you think about ways to grow partners on the platform?

And then, any dynamics to call out with respect to the different commission points you launched earlier in '21. 15%, 25%, 30% as cohorts of partners, experience or use that model or they moving up to the different commission points?

A - Tony Xu{BIO 20536033 <GO>}
Yeah, I'll take the first question and maybe Prabir can take the second on the kind of different tiers of commission points.

With respect to the first of adding more selection in these new categories, a lot of it is just doing the work quite candidly, I think what has been really attractive to all of these customers is well, I mean, look at what we bring and and bring the largest on-demand audience for local commerce that has the highest frequency of shopping, that's an incremental used case, both from their physical activities, their own digital activities, and other -- any other previous digital partnerships that they've signed.

And so as a result of that, actually we're seeing quite a lot of excitement where people are starting to think of DoorDash not just as lunch and dinner, but really everything inside the neighborhood. So referencing quite a lot of progress. And, you know, but that doesn't mean that there isn't work to be done. I mean we have to build a lot of products now that makes sense for categories outside of restaurants, right. Everything from the catalog to the in-store shopping process to how we think about customer support, to think about how do we support people, not just again on our channel but also their own channel.

So there's a lot of work to be done. But I would say that the excitement from partners has been tremendous. I think some of those names you've seen in the press and things like this and we expect adding a lot more partners to come.

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Brian. And on the question about the pricing tiers, just as a reminder, this was aimed at SMB restaurants and that larger restaurants and those that are coming through our self-served channel. So, a small fraction of those have actually opted into the pricing tiers versus (inaudible) pricing and of the number -- that after then the majority have picked up two higher tiers, which was in line with what we expected and kind of make sense given the value that we drive into higher pricing.

Q - Brian Fitzgerald{BIO 15325680 <GO>}

The next question comes from the line of Jim Sanderson with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.

Q - Jim Sanderson{BIO 21154385 <GO>}
Thanks for the question. I just wanted to follow up a little bit more on DashPass and wonder if you could help us to understand how the new DashPass members were recruited, if this is primarily through credit card marketing programs?

And then going forward as you try to expand these types of programs Internationally, if your client acquisition strategy for DashPass is going to have to adjust away from credit cards? Just a little bit more texture on how that growth has developed?

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
Yeah, the vast majority of the DashPass members are through our own channels, and the minority are actually [ph]other channels.

Q - Jim Sanderson{BIO 21154385 <GO>}
And then are the percentage of share of DashPass members that pay full membership, is that changing every time?

A - Prabir Adarkar{BIO 20650221 <GO>}
No, slightly consistent. But again, it depends on -- you'd remember that one of the ways we get people activate them on DashPass is through a free trial period, so depending on the intensity of our marketing efforts, the trial which has been mixed changes was usually consistent.

Q - Jim Sanderson{BIO 21154385 <GO>}
