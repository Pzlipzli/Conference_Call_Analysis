Presentation
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Progressive Corporation's Third Quarter Investor Event. The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website. Acting as moderator for the event will be Progressive Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine.

At this time, I will turn the event over to Mr. Constantine.

Doug Constantine{BIO 22182643 <GO>}
Thank you, Austin, and good morning. Although our quarterly investor relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60-minute schedule for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. The dial-in instructions maybe found at investors.progressive.com/events. As always discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements.

These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first, second, and third quarter of 2022, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face.

Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make some introductory comments. Tricia?

Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. When our customers interact with us, they are often doing so on their worst day. Maybe their vehicles hav just stolen, maybe they were injured in a accident or are their property damaged with the annualized. This fact comes into even sharper focus during a major catastrophes, such as Hurricane Ian. While watching the footage of devastation, my heart went out to all those who are affected by the storm.

For million, it was truly their worst day. And I'm proud of the part Progressive plays to help people recover from such a calamitous event. Within hours after the storm, Progressive had over 1,500 people ready to help our customers start to rebuild their lives. And while we cannot always replace what was lost, our people are in-place to make it as easy as possible for our customers to return to normalcy. Thank you to all the Progressive customers, who trust us to make their worst day more manageable. In my letter, I shared some of the herculean efforts that our employees were making on behalf of our customers. And there are many more where that came from.

Needless to say, I'm very proud of so many. Well, Hurricane Ian was the largest single event in the third quarter, it was not the whole story. Excluding catastrophe losses, our third quarter companywide combined ratio improved 1.9 points year-over-year and illustrates the significant work we've done to combat the effects of inflation and working towards achieving our goal of an underwriting margin of at least 4% specifically in personal auto. As we stated after the first-quarter, with the exception of a few markets our major personal auto rate revisions are behind us. So we continue to be vigilant and adjust rates as our loss experience develops.

In the third quarter, we increased personal auto rates in 20 states, at average of about 5% per se for a total countrywide premium impact of plus 2%. The third quarter rate actions brings our countrywide year-to-date rate increases to nearly 12%. We continue to closely monitor frequency and severity trends to ensure we stay true to our stated goal of profit before growth. So we have continued to take rate we believe we took rate earlier than the industry, which initially negatively impacted volume, but more recently has created opportunities for growth.

Consumer shopping and quoting has increased more than 20% in both the agency and direct channels. In fact in both channels, we had the best July, August, and September in our company's history for quote volume. This prospect growth is despite a lower acquisition expense ratio as compared to 2021, allowing us to be a beneficiary as competitors have pulled back on marketing spend. The combination of lower competitor spend and our continued advancement of the science of media planning and buying led to an incredible increase in efficiency in our media spend and that's helped propel this quarter's growth.

Auto quote growth, coupled with continued improvement in conversion as our competitors raise rates led to auto new application growth of 20% in the quarter, including the highest August and the highest September combined channel on new application volume that we've seen in the company's history. Total personal auto year-over-year PIF growth is still negative, but we've now seen several months of sequential monthly PIF growth led by the growth in the direct channel and flattening in the agency channel.

The sequential growth has been bolstered not only by new application growth, but signs of improving retention. In last quarter's call, we spent considerable time talking about our Property business and efforts we are taking to return to profitable growth. The losses incurred from Hurricane Ian further highlights the need to shift our mix to less volatile states. As expected, PIF growth in Property has slowed in the quarter as we make progress in this multiyear goal. Our assets continue unabated with rate and non-rate actions as we work towards in mix that is more reflective of the market.

Given this volatile backdrop, it's only natural that the insurance industry would be facing questions regarding capital. So we thought it would be useful to quickly summarize our strong capital position. As discussed in our annual report, we view our capital position as consisting of multiple layers. First, in our insurance operating subsidiaries, we maintain adequate surplus to support growing as fast as we can at or below 96 combined ratio.

Our extreme contingency layer includes capital in excess of regulatory capital that insurers on a model basis are less than 1 in 200 probability that we will need to raise additional capital. We have $4.2 billion that we held at quarter-end and a non-insurance subsidiary of the holding company level, which is well in excess of that contingency layer and is highly liquid due to mostly being comprised of short-term securities and treasuries. While we have incurred temporary losses in our investment portfolio due to the significant move in interest rates, our fixed-income portfolio is extremely conservative with over half of the portfolio in cash or treasuries and our portfolio duration at the end of the quarter at 2.7 years.

Throughout the year, we've taken proactive measures to prepare the portfolio from various scenarios, by reducing interest-rate, credit, and equity risk. Another proactive measure we took was to raise $1.5 billion of 510 in 30 year debt in March. At an average 3% interest rate. Due to the highly uncertain outlook, we felt it was prudent to have extra capital at what we viewed as very attractive borrowing rates. As we said, we have no near-term bond maturities that we have to address in this higher interest-rate environment. The combination of the borrowing along with a significant interest increase in interest rates have been the primary drivers in moving our debt to a total capital ratio of over 30% at September month end to 30.2%.

We expect underwriting gains, changes in the value of our bond portfolio as bonds approach maturity, and investment income to bring us back below 30% in time. We are currently thinking no additional actions to bring the ratio below 30% and have no near-term plan or need for raising further capital.

Again, thank you for joining us. And now we'll take your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). The question comes from the line. Our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse, please proceed.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question is on loss adjustment expenses. I know you guys had called them out in reference to your property book in September and not in reference to the auto book. I'm just trying to get a sense and there were some comments in the queue it doesn't seem like LAE, it's a high component of auto losses and the reason I ask is it does look like the underlying loss ratio, it turned a higher in September and that does run a little counter to some of your comments right that it seems like you're at where you need from a rating perspective in the majority of states. So, I'm hoping you can just help me kind of tie that together.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, absolutely. Let me start Elyse with the LAE itself. When you think about vehicles which I would include auto in special lines, there's not much incremental LAE when a catastrophe happens. So for years and years, we've built-up a CAT team and it's now commensurate to the size that we are. So when a CAT happens really the incremental LAE on that part is travel cost, hotel costs et cetera. And then during the year, those people are able to do other things. So as an example, In Ian right now they're in Florida working those files but then as that slowed down If there are other weather-related events or catastrophes teammates are work in the salvage department to work through that salvage. So, it's not hugely incremental. We called it out on the property side, because that is, a little bit more incremental on that $25 million of the 200 of the reinsurance and that was because we do use some independent appraisers adjusters to help with the Property Claims, so that's the reason why we called it out.

And, now that will evolve we wanted to assess a certain point for (Inaudible) and a certain point for loss and that will evolve as the storm develop. In terms of where we're at, I do feel very comfortable, like I said in most markets, there are a few that we don't have the rate we need and look we're going to continue to take our smaller bites of the apple which is what we prefer to do, and that's why I wanted to outline that in my letter and opening comments. But curious how I would think about where we're at from that perspective of adequate rates.

And this is a very high level, so you'd have to think about this in terms of new versus renewal, channel et cetera. So our frequency is down 9%. Our severity is up 13% in aggregate. So, think about -- about a 4% net loss ratio. Our average written premium is up 8%, so you want to think of that we have 6.5 points to earn in. So when I think about that, I feel good about where we're at again, we're watching inflation very closely, but we do feel, I'm confident that in most venues we have the rate we need to grow and we'll try to propel that growth and where we can and slower where we don't believe our rates are adequate. Is that help?

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Yeah, but as a follow-up to that, was there something in September just because the underlying loss ratio did look like not that it only trended up from August, but it trended up from last September. So, was there something just related to losses running hot in September relative to last year?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Nothing in particular and this is the curse of releasing monthly -- monthly earnings. I wouldn't -- I wouldn't look into one month as Pat mentioned it out so [ph] now.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Okay, thanks. And then my second question on, as we think about getting to the end of the year and I know you guys mentioned this in your Q as well, we care about used car prices coming down and I know that was what started to lead to elevated severity last year, have you guys ever broken out what component of your loss costs are driven-off of used-car prices or can you just help us think through that and the benefit that you guys could see sales value is come down.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Well, we look at the components, but what I would say is, although the wholesale prices are trending down, there still all-time highs. So we will continue to watch that. And I think especially we will watch it based on the fact that there are a lot of total losses that have happened in Florida with Hurricane Ian, so that could even increase demand. So we tried to break-out as much as we can, when we look at severity we look more at overall loss cost in terms of vehicles, labor rates, parts prices, rental price et cetera, so there's, a lot of components that go into that. But we're going to wait and see and continue to watch the Manheim Index and watch what happens after Ian, and if we will see that in our severity trends.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Okay, thank you for the color.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thanks, Elyse.

Operator
Our next question is with Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Michael, your line is open.

Q - Michael Phillips{BIO 21023048 <GO>}
Thanks, good morning. Tricia, I wonder if you could fill back some of the layers on the frequency is still favorable in fact once even more so than prior quarters. I guess, can you talk about what you're seeing in your work for maybe work-from-home trends and sustainability of that and kind of what you're baking into current pricing for how much you are baking on that to continue in your current price level?. Thanks.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Sure, Michael. So in quarter three was our snapshot data we saw vehicle miles traveled down about 11%. Previously, it was down about 14%, what we're seeing is can your miles have stayed flat and during the quarter we saw that travel miles so think of those defined as from your home 100 miles to or from your home. So we think that might have been based on some lower gas prices people are doing some last-minute travel, because of those prices in their cars in during -- the before Labor Day visiting grandma or whatever and that usually involves less losses. So it's made [ph] more congestion you're going to have more losses.

So, we think about it that way. I don't think we'll know we're frequency sort of that trends long-term and still probably a quarter or two, because I know a lot of companies that they were returning to work after Labor Day. So you're thinking in September so what we'd like to do is, wait at least a couple of quarters to see if that sort of bottomed out and look at that pre-pandemic to 2019, and then we'll feel I think a little bit more confident and because I know a lot of companies have gone back and forth on how often their employees need to work and I think a lot of it will depend to on COVID and flu et cetera.

So we're going to wait a few quarters, but that's what we're seeing right now in our UBI data.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Okay. And one clarification that, so Tricia mentioned frequency of vehicle miles traveled was down 11% that was referencing the pre-pandemic period. So when we think about vehicle miles traveled, we continue to measure it relative to pre-COVID. And interestingly, frequency is down a bit more than vehicle miles traveled and that's continued for quite some time has not yet come back and we believe to Tricia's comments that is due to some degree to the mix of miles per travel.

Q - Michael Phillips{BIO 21023048 <GO>}
Yes, perfect, okay thanks for that. I guess, can you talk about used car prices coming down. And how that impacts I guess the mix of your strategy of kind of either fixing cars versus salvage cars and how that I don't know if you talk about the impact of that last year when there was just a reversal of that one car prices were so high. And so any impact -- what's the impact of that on the loss ratio last year of changing that strategy because of how high prices, wonder and how that might change as we go forward from here?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Well, I don't know that changed the strategy, it just happened to be that cars are more expensive. So, it took more to total them and then we did total them parts and components from our expenses. So we'll always look at the actual cash value of the vehicle and then the cost to repair, which could take into account rental et cetera, so that's how we always look at it. And then you overlay the actual cost of the cars whether newer used when you make those assessments.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Just a little more clarification since Elyse had a similar question. When we, think about the increase in severity for physical damage coverage is our property damage collision, et cetera, a walking around number is about 0.5 [ph] increase is from the increase in used car values. That is both when we total a car but as Tricia was mentioning you total fewer cars because the car is worth more so you're going to -- your estimates on repairs are going to go up as a result of used-car prices as well. So it's a little tough to tease out but sort of walking around is probably half of the severity increases we've seen as physical damage coverage are due to the increase in values.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Great point.

Q - Michael Phillips{BIO 21023048 <GO>}
All right, thank you.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thanks, Michael.

Operator
And our next question is with Mike Zaremski from BMO. Mike, your line is open.

Q - Mike Zaremski{BIO 22333535 <GO>}
Hey, great, good morning. I'm sticking to the auto severity side of the equation I like the good color, thank you so far. May be curious if you could offer any color and whether there's any trends you're seeing on the bodily injury side or maybe just severity ex kind of used car prices more broadly?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
So on the bodily injury side, Mike.

Q - Mike Zaremski{BIO 22333535 <GO>}
Correct.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, we've actually seen a bodily injury that has been fairly stable and the kind of 6% to 8% range. And, of course, it went up after the pandemic that was based on more attorney representation, more soft tissue attorney representation, not necessarily litigation, and then just the overall social inflation. But we're seeing that level out in the 6% to 8% range.

Q - Mike Zaremski{BIO 22333535 <GO>}
And that's kind of considered kind of a more normal range we think versus pre-pandemic levels there is kind of know secular trend or something that we should be thinking about moving around they're materially?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, it's hard to say because during the pandemic there was little or none, and I think, it went up pretty significantly. So yeah I think that'd be accurate to say in that range of pre-pandemic.

Q - Mike Zaremski{BIO 22333535 <GO>}
Okay. I guess just going back to frequency again just curious know you guys are now able to give us some great stats on vehicle miles traveled and what you're seeing on commuter versus maybe non-commuter trips and kind of just curious does the data you have today, does it allow you to progressive to be any more agile or do you guys do things definitely one setting rates today versus maybe when you think back that 2016, 2017 frequency spike cycle that you feel you can take advantage of being more opportunistic or is it still kind of nothing has changed much, it's very tough to figure out frequency and I'm thinking too much about this.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
No, I think you're thinking, going thinking about all-the-time the hard part of it, there's so many macroeconomic trends for that frequency you saw that with gas prices and so I think there's a lot of things that we constantly look at in our model, I think the best thing when we think of pricing for our customers encourage them to your snapshot and that's us as, you know, a big approach for people who want to be able to save money, especially if they are not driving. So I mean, we've seen an uptick in the take rate and our mix of business, new business in UBI and we think that's great because of consumers' cars are sitting in their garages more often than not, they should get a discount as long as when they're driving that they're driving safely.

Q - Mike Zaremski{BIO 22333535 <GO>}
And although Snapshot customers, just as my follow-up, slightly more profitable over time than the announced Snapshot customers? thanks.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, no, not necessarily.

A - Unidentified Speaker
We continue to price as accurately as we can with the data we have. So as our Snapshot database continues to grow and we move to a continuous monitoring model, we have an increasing dataset to work with and an ongoing dataset to work with because we have continuous monitoring and I think eight states now and are continuing to roll that across the country. Earlier, was Snapshot we weren't pricing completely to the curve if you will and as consumer adoption as Tricia noted has gotten to be really good and growing, we've been more and more comfortable pricing to the full curve which is the best accurate segmentation we get.

Q - Mike Zaremski{BIO 22333535 <GO>}
Thank you.

Operator
Our next question is with Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Alex, your line is open.

Q - Alex Scott{BIO 20003952 <GO>}
Hi. Question I had was just on the strategy of pivoting to growth and pricing. When I think about the timing of when you are sort of looked at it and decided that you can take maybe the foot off the accelerator on price a little bit feeling better about your adequacy, yes, since that time, there has been some benefit from gas prices and frequency that you know it may go away and there is also, I think been increases to sort of the non-used car pieces of severity and medical costs and wage inflation sort of impacting things. Is being able to stick to that and try to drive growth here. I mean is there a risk that those things force you to change course, I mean how should I think about that risk sort of different severity items and getting a little worse since you started down that road on the strategy?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, we have had a long-term strategy and grow as fast as we can at or below a 96 combined ratio that will continue that's something that's worked for us for 85 years at least since we went public in 1971 when we first started talking about the 96. So we will do that, we watch trends very, very diligently and take actions quickly when and decisively when we need to, I mean, unfortunately, in this last year we've had to take rate increases that we normally don't want to take, we don't like to take huge rate increases like we have like we talked about smaller bites of the apple which we believe we're now in a position to take as things change in each venue.

So our strategy hasn't changed. We're going to try to grow as fast as we can, obviously, with the hurricane for over 96, but we have a few months to go and we're going to continue to try to leverage this really unique opportunity to get growth while still maintaining our 96 combined ratio, in fact, in September, we had our lowest-cost per sale since 2017, so we're seeing really the advantage of (Technical Difficulty) because our competitors are advertising as much, undertaking rate we're seeing some really great and being growth.

So we're going to try to pull all the levers to do that to grow as fast we can but we do have the 96 that we believe we always talk about profit over growth.

Q - Alex Scott{BIO 20003952 <GO>}
Got it, that's helpful, and could you help us frame the potential impact from higher reinsurance costs as we think through the hard market in reinsurance and I guess probably impacts you more on the property side and just looking through some of the commentary on your how quickly you can non-renew and sort of do some of the pivoting that you wanted to do it sounds like some of that had to slow-down for regulatory reasons. What does that all mean when we think through the reinsurance costs potentially going up?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I'll have Dave talk about reinsurance but I'll hit on the certain derisk in the Florida book. I will say that reinsurance costs we are able to pass on so that is one benefit but clearly, that market is hardening. So we talked about our goal of derisking the portfolio specifically, in moving 60,000 policies out of Florida homes, out of Florida, so just sort of mitigate that risk, it takes a while, so we talked about that last year, we had a 90-day notification period to our customers; so in earnest, we started non-renewing those 60,000 in May of 2022.

And then there was a special legislative session and there was a Senate Bill that allowed us to -- it allows homeowners to renew their policy as long as they could prove their inspection that they had at least five years of useful life left on their roof, which is great because that's okay with us that at least we know the rate to risk when we now old the roof is. So we knew that would be less than 60,000 policies and it would take a little bit longer and then of course enter Hurricane Ian and there has been a moratorium on non-CAT, non renews in cancellations from September 28th to November 28th. So we won't be able to non-renew any until after that is lifted, those executive orders are lifted.

So suffice it to say that it's going to take us a little bit longer to derisk and we get that and we'll continue to update everyone as that happens. I will say that we are not open for new business in Asia 3, DP3, or Asia 6, so Home Dwelling Fire and Condo, and we will not be open for new business until the executive order is lifted. The only caveat is we have some new homes with a select group of builders, brand-new homes that we will be working with them so they can close and have insurance on their homes.

So I think the punch line is, it's a volatile environment but we remain focused on achieving our goal and having our portfolio of homes across the country. Not based on all the risky areas, so, Dave, do you want to add anything on the reinsurance?

A - Dave Pratt{BIO 18833444 <GO>}
Sure, Tricia, thank you, good morning, everyone. I would just note that we have long continuous stable trading relationships with lots of big reinsurance providers. And we try to be very transparent with them about our results and our business plans. And so we feel confident that we'll continue to have access to the reinsurance that we need. And we believe that we get favorable pricing based on that transparency. It does seem likely that costs will go up next year and we will pass those through our rate filings as quickly as we can to make sure they're accurately reflected in our prices.

A - Unidentified Speaker
I'd also add if you have some multi-year agreements so our entire program is now really not up for renewal in any given year, which helps us mitigate the impact of increases and allows us to better put those increases into our primary prices. We do also use some insurance-linked securities that you also cat bonds so we're trying to diversify our reinsurance and catastrophe coverage program, both for time and for the instruments we used to ensure that we are stable as possible.

Q - Alex Scott{BIO 20003952 <GO>}

Our next question is from Greg Peters from Raymond James. Greg, your line is open.

Q - Greg Peters{BIO 3111497 <GO>}
Good morning. I guess I'd like to pivot for the first question on the commercial lines results. And I know in your letter you call out the unusual items with the TNC policies that affected the third quarter results. And then you said the net would have been up around 2%, excluding all the noise and that's certainly doesn't seem to be growing as fast as you can considering our combined ratios below 96. So, (Technical Difficulty) you mentioned the BOP policies the other -- some of the other initiatives, can you -- sort of map out how you think growth is going to emerge in that business because it seems like it's slowing down not speeding up?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah I can map out sort of what happened and how we're positioned for the future. So we had such an opportunity in our for hire trucking Business Markets here when the pandemic happened. So many many people as I'm sure you did, you're having lots of goodship so obviously, you had the trucking industry grew. And it grew in different ways, so we have spot rates for up so a lot of owner operators would leave from a carrier and go on their own to be able to make it on their own.

We were there for them, we were there at the right rate and we have a history of these customers. So, it's a really beautiful growth. So even when you look at that 2% you kind of look at the denominator because the last couple of years have been unbelievably successful in Commercial Lines. So now that the spot rates have gone down a little bit in softened, some of those carriers are going -- some of those owner operators are going back to carriers. We do have a couple coverage non-truckers liability and GL where we can keep those peers when they're not when they're away from doing business with the carrier that they are part of. So we think we'll continue to grow so that's more of a retention piece.

And, what I would say is the opportunity that we have is because we're so diversified in commercial. So think, a few years ago we only (Inaudible) or fewer power or units. Now we went to 40 and then of course we purchased Protective which can give us an opportunity to be able to ensure some of those medium to large fleets. So we feel really good about our position there, and of course Bob we have nearly 40 states I think 37 and that will continue to grow those are things we invested in three plus years ago, because we know this the Commercial Lines is very cyclical and very links to macroeconomic trends.

So although the growth is smaller on a percentage basis, we've grown tremendously in Commercial Lines, we have a tremendous plan laid out, a 10-year plan (Inaudible) you've laid out to continue to grow and continue to diversify that I make sure that we're able to be there when a difference economic shift happens.

Q - Greg Peters{BIO 3111497 <GO>}
Okay. I appreciate the detail there. I guess, I'm going to pivot from my second question. In your letter you talked about evaluating underwriting restrictions bill plans, media spend and this is going to be focused on the expense ratio and the personal Lines business. You said in your comments that you were looking at frequency and those type of trends pre-pandemic. So if I look at your expense ratio, pre-pandemic like the 2019 point in time and compared to where it is today, today, it's a lot lower.

I guess as you consider ramping up your growth plans in auto, is it conceivable that the expense ratio will start tracking -- trending back up, as you spend more on advertising et cetera. And should we look at to 2019 sort of the base year for where the expense ratio might go to?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, it's very conceivable, also we looked at expense ratio with the regular expenses and non-acquisition expense ratios, we will spend given the take away the 96 for a moment we will spend as much as we can as long as we believe it's a session. So while our expense ratio was lower now, like I said we're really bullish on growth for this quarter because of what we're seeing in the (Inaudible) shopping and just the environment based on our competitors spending our competitors' rates.

So here you can see go up if we continue to spend in advertising, I will say that we're constantly looking at our plan on both loss ratio -- expense ratio in LAE to make sure we can continue to be efficient because we do want to spend more and acquisition funnel. So here you can see it go up a little bit as we determine what the right spend is and, of course, we have the 96 Governors, so that is going into play a little bit right now.

Our next question is with David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. David, your line is open.

Q - David Motemaden{BIO 18818634 <GO>}
Thanks, good morning. Tricia, last quarter you said that you don't have local media ad spend on in 19 states. I mean I think that compared to 26 states as of the end of April. I was wondering if you could share where that stands today, how many states do not have local media on at this point in time and maybe some color around, how much in premium those states represent?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, I'll let Pat, take that. I'm not sure the exact number, I believe it's less than 17 though, but I'm not sure exactly again we look at that just based on our ability to grow, our ability to get the right rate. So in the states where we can get rate obviously will continue to make sure that we do everything we can that to grow, so we're just waiting for the rates are earn in and will start to loosen up those underwriting guidelines and the local media spend. Pat, do you want to add anything?

A - Pat Callahan{BIO 19087798 <GO>}
Yeah, without sharing kind of number of states because your question about percent of premium is kind of the most relevant piece. The other piece, it's complex is we say local media but there's seven different elements of local media, whether it's digital paid social, direct mail, lots of things going on in that space. I think what's important is to get back to Tricia's comment about we will spend when we can afford to spend based on the calendar year targets, when the spend is efficient relative to lifetime performance on the media.

And frankly when we need to spend to drive growth and that's why it's pretty dynamic at the channel level and ultimately the split within local media where we decide to spend versus not spend. So right now, we have some states, couple of big ones on the coasts where we don't yet have adequate rates on the street, and now we're optimizing obviously the efficiency of our expenses there, given our loss ratios are high because we can get the rate that we need under the expected losses. So what I would say is, it's dynamic and we make adjustments all the time and as soon as we get adequate rates. We are open for business and increasingly, we are getting adequate rates in some additional states. It's just taken longer than we had expected to previously.

Q - David Motemaden{BIO 18818634 <GO>}
Got it, thanks that's helpful. And also, Tricia it was great to get the color just on the capital position and that the debt to capital. I guess, I'm wondering if you could help us think about how we should think about the variable dividend level this year and just sort of as you guys think about the growth opportunity. Yeah, that's in front of you, how you're sort of thinking about that?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah absolutely, so, the primary the best use I should say of our capital is to grow the firm. And that's where we're going to try to do especially like we said in this unique environment. So we have this conversation, every time we meet with the board will be with them again in December and if we don't believe we can grow of course to give it back in either dividends or stock buybacks, we know at this juncture, I can't say whether or not we'll have a variable dividend that will ultimately be the Board's decision. I will tell you that I want to take advantage and leverage this opportunity to grow the firm.

Q - David Motemaden{BIO 18818634 <GO>}
Great, thank you.

Our next question is Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners. Gary, your line is open.

Q - Gary Ransom{BIO 3446828 <GO>}
Good morning. I wanted to go revisit the frequency question, just looking at the actual disclosures in the queue where we have frequency down broadly 9% that's year-over-year, not pre-pandemic. And when I think about the broader environment that's actually counterintuitive to me, because I'm thinking about the economy still being a little bit closed down a year ago, and frequency probably I would expect it to be increasing and in fact when I look at available industry data it is increasing at least through six months. And so you seem to be moving in a different direction than I might have expected and I wondered if you can add some color or possible reasons for why that might be happening.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, and the nine was for the quarter, we're down much more in frequency if you look at the trailing 12 versus a trailing 13 to 24 down more like in the 2% range. So I can't comment on how other people look at frequency but we are down -- we're down lower if you look at that timeframe I just outlined. Do you want to add anything, John?

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Gary, yes, we have done a lot to move to ensure we have profitable business coming in the door, so when you do that you're going to first seek to apply underwriting efforts against the highest frequency business likely that is producing the highest loss ratios as Pat Callahan mentioned, we've also had some challenges getting price in some very large markets that have fairly high-frequency as states. So in aggregate, I get your perspective and we've noted the same but recognize that there is a lot going on with the mix of our business due to where we've been growing or shrinking both geographically and at the segment level that is going to drive that number as well.

Q - Gary Ransom{BIO 3446828 <GO>}
All right, that's helpful. Actually, that's a fairly positive statement on what you've been able to do versus what the rest of the industry is doing, but anyway I had another question on Snapshot too. I noticed in the Q, it looked like there was an uptick in the attach rate for Snapshot, particularly, in Direct and I wondered whether there was something you were doing, is that part of the advertising and maybe you just have some general comments about the acceptance of that product in the market?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, I'll add some general comments on the path, you want to add anything we have seen an uptick in new business for Snapshot is now in the low 30% range. The biggest uptick was in direct we have about 45% of our new business using Snapshot and of course, John talked about our continuous model which we have, he said it is eight, I'm not sure if it's seven or eight which is about 11% of earned premium so we're excited about that continue to gather data out we have. In the continuous model, we have a deeper flat discount for participation and then steeper either factors from maximum discount and surcharge.

So I don't think, that's a big factor but we do believe people see this as something where they can control part of their insurance cost and we're pretty excited about it. Pat, do you want to add anything?

A - Pat Callahan{BIO 19087798 <GO>}
Yeah. I would just echo the continuous evolution of the experience that we build around Snapshot to make it easier for consumers to find, understand their savings, and then enroll in the program both in the direct channel and in the two states' distribution through agents, because obviously getting agents on-board that this is a good thing for their clients is important. We think part of it is process, so on the direct side, we've been continuing to improve the experience and invest there and have seen some recent wins and how we present the offer that's been helping. But we also think there are some macroeconomic things going on right when there is an inflationary environment, consumers are squeezed and they get a rate increase from their current carrier wins shopping. They want to save money and we believe Snapshot is not only a personalized way to save money, but to get rewarded for safe driving behavior, and we think that's resonating with a greater number of consumers and the agents who sell our products over time.

Q - Gary Ransom{BIO 3446828 <GO>}
Is the attach rate or you said 45% for direct, is there a similar number that you're willing to give on the Asian at this point?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Now I think increasing somewhat. Especially, from pre-pandemic, like Pat said, it's a little bit more difficult and we're really encouraging agents to use this as one of the many variables to make sure we get -- we give our combined customers the best rates if their driving behavior warrants the same.

Q - Gary Ransom{BIO 3446828 <GO>}
All right, thank you very much.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}

Our next question is with Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Josh, your line is open.

Q - Josh Shanker{BIO 5292022 <GO>}
Yeah, thank you. As we enter 2023 and I'm now a health insurance expert but it seems to me that Medicare and a lot of the health insurers set the rates earlier in the year and while inflationary costs are built-in right now, I may not be in the health insurance costs which could mean we could see some severity increase on the bodily injury side next year. One other thing is truth and how I'm thinking about this in two given the duration of liabilities in your portfolio, what is the impact that might have on next year's results?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, what I would say from that perspective obviously, we watch the costs that we incur for our bodily injury but we also have inflation, inflation built into our reservings. So we build that in based on a lot of data and including what's happening in the health-care so those inflationary percentages are built-in based on what's going on in the overall health-care industry.

A - Unidentified Speaker
They set those inflation factors in our reserves the product managers who are pricing at the state level will be reflected in those in their prices as well and I think, it's a valid concern, it's something we're watching and certainly to the extent we see Medical inflation rate picking up, we will be dialing that into our prices as soon as we can.

Q - Josh Shanker{BIO 5292022 <GO>}
And in terms of you were experienced with a distracted driving knowledge, where are we at the sort of trends we saw I guess emerging from the pandemic, it's the extent to which people are looking at their phones when they're driving are heartbreaking, do we see changes in that from where we've been over the past 12 to 18 months.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
And I guess specifically to distracted driving, I think we've reached those sort of levels of fatalities have leveled off they had an increase I think right when there was a less driving people, speeds were higher, fatalities were higher, I think that's starting to level-off that might be the fact that there is more congestion because there are more people going back to work. I couldn't adequately give you a specific number on that.

Q - Josh Shanker{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Our next question is from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Andrew, your line is open.

Q - Andrew Kligerman{BIO 1551668 <GO>}
Hey, good morning. Question around policy in-force growth. I think in the quarter, it was up about 0.5%, could you give a little color on that August and September headcount that you said were -- was at record levels, could you put some numbers behind that and the potential for policy in-force growth in the fourth quarter?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
How much numbers I can put into it, I mean, obviously, PIF growth goes into both new business and renewal business, a lot of it has to do with obviously our app growth which we think is positive it takes a little bit of time to in. And what I will say is our renewal growth looks very positive and we think a lot of that has to do with if even if our insurers to get an increase of their shopping the likelihood of they're leaving is lower. So we're seeing that renewal business increased as well so we feel that we've reached, we talked we've reached the bottom from a retention perspective and that PIF growth should start to continue to improve.

Q - Andrew Kligerman{BIO 1551668 <GO>}
So maybe at least a mid-single-digit PIF growth.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I never like to guess, so you know that are two weeks from today you'll have our October results and then 30 days after our November results.

Q - Andrew Kligerman{BIO 1551668 <GO>}
I won't push anymore and then one question, apologies for another frequency question, but as I looked at the 10-Qs and tell me if my math is right. If I look at today's frequency against pre-pandemic, it's nearly down 20%, is that a good math and if so is there a reason and it was a great answer to the question before I get that business mix has changed a lot, but is there a reason to believe that maybe frequency could spike up very sharply and very quickly. I know, Tricia, you were saying that you're going to look at it over the next two quarters, so one is my math right, and two, is there any reason to be concerned it could just sharply jump up at some point in the near-term?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Your math is accurate. It's so hard to say because it can change with so many variables. I do feel like it's become a little bit more stable in the last couple of quarters but you can see what happens really around the globe if something happens with OPEC and fuel prices things change dramatically. If work-from-home happens if something happens where we're hearing about flu season or the next variant of COVID, those things can happen, we really can't predict those, we do watch those literally on a daily basis, and then we can react to those once we have those but we do see we believe a little bit more stability but I'd like to see several more quarters of that, at least a few.

Q - Andrew Kligerman{BIO 1551668 <GO>}
Thanks, very much.

Our next question is from Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Yaron, your line is open.

Q - Yaron Kinar{BIO 17146197 <GO>}
Thank you and good morning. My first question is on used car prices coming down a bit and at the same time we're seeing body shop labor severity going up. So maybe it's a two-part question. Here one, are you seeing the percentage of total vehicles dropped and two beyond just for the math of severity of used cars and severity of body shop labor. Are there other elements that we should be thinking about, namely like LAE be different when you handle total claim versus body shop repair claim?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
You know, well, each loss is dependent on the severity of what's happening in the car, so that again but that the dynamic those employees are there, so they're going to handle kind of a mix of (Technical Difficulty) total losses and some easier head. So that's sort of washes out and the denominator. What I would say is we have seen used car prices go down the Manheim Index, we're going to continue to watch that and again it takes some time, because there's still a supply-demand issue. We're going to wait to see what happens with Hurricane Ian. We are seeing labor rates are up about 3%, parts are up about 4% to 5%

The only other thing that we looked at that had been up but is pretty flat right now our rental severity.

Q - Yaron Kinar{BIO 17146197 <GO>}
Okay, thanks. And then maybe one follow-up on the Ian-related LAE. So understanding that it is incremental and I don't know if you can give any additional quantification beyond incremental, but maybe another part of this would be in the LAE that you have for Ian in September, did you already try and capture potentially additional LAE that you still expect to emerge kind of an equivalent of an IBNR, if you will or is that just for the month of September.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
It was for the month of September because we want to take that 209 retention and assess the apart for indemnity and apart for LAE. So the 25 is sort of our first assessment and that number will likely evolve over time.

Q - Yaron Kinar{BIO 17146197 <GO>}
Sorry. I meant for the auto, not the property piece.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Oh, for the property piece. In terms of LAE?

Q - Yaron Kinar{BIO 17146197 <GO>}
For the auto piece, (Multiple Speakers) LAE, yeah.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Again so the auto piece for LAE that we don't actually separate that out, when we report, we report loss plus LAE, but that again with the exception of some travel and some hotels and stuff, we already have that baked in because we already have a certain number of claims people on our books. And a certain number of claims that will happen and when our hurricane happens that doesn't necessarily flex up, because of that we already have a CAT team, that if they're not handling weather-related events or doing other things within the claims organization.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
Thank you, you're auto new application growth is up 20% mostly on the direct side. Can you touch on the quality of the new business you are seeing. I'm wondering if you're quote combined ratio changed as you're seeing more submissions.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I didn't hear the last part of your question, but in the first part of the question, we always believe that we put good business on the books because we have so many variables that as long as we can make our target profit margin of course that's different and new renewal agency derived each day, we always believed that the business we put on the books should be able to, how to reach our target profit goals. And so, we wouldn't want to put it on the books that's what we have underwriting restrictions in other things. So that we believe is good business, and of course, that evolves and we'll be able to tell you how that underlying is in the next coming months. I didn't hear the second part of your question.

Q - Unidentified Participant
About quote to bind ratio.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Okay, yeah. I was just referring (multiple speakers).

A - Unidentified Speaker
Go ahead, I got your question on quote to bind Tracy. Let me just comment on the quality just to build on Tricia's comments. So obviously we monitor the quality in-coming business regularly and we have seen a significant spike in business coming from competitors. Which is great, right. If competitors are raising rates base rates and pushing customers to shop, we believe the power of our segmentation helps us select the right risks at the right rate for lifetime profitability. So we look very closely at that quality of the business we're always paranoid that we're getting business that someone else is shedding, but we're, very comfortable with what we're writing and as Tricia mentioned, we want to grow with the right business and we feel like we have that in place right now.

As far as your quote to bind ratio question, there's a lot of moving parts in there because when you have massive increases in shopping you had a different motivation levels of customers and conversion rate is obviously dependent on the mix of business that shopping how competitive our pricing is relative to where they are shopping from as there always comparing for a prior insurance customer what they're paying today versus what they could pay tomorrow and that's where we think the power of segmentation particularly in the agency channel we're comparative raters create effectively a transparency, rates across different carriers.

And segmentation and pricing accuracy enables us to grow in the right places while avoiding adverse selection that potentially goes to our competitors.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
Okay, the directionally has a teams for you?

A - Unidentified Speaker
Directionally conversion more recently is slightly down, as we see prospect -- record prospect growth, which is a normal dynamic more shoppers some are less motivated aggregate conversion does slide a little.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
Okay and then on a cohort basis, how many policy terms do you think it will take for that new business to meet your quote to bind ratio target?

A - Unidentified Speaker
So on a cohort basis obviously we look at a lifetime basis and it all depends on how quickly we grow, right. We've gotten the question for I think decades about the growth tax and how we think about new versus renewal and I think as Tricia mentioned, we will spend where we can be efficient in acquiring customers and acquire them at what we believe in new business combined ratio is that will produce our lifetime profit targets.

So with that construct as we think about it, if we grow quickly there will be potentially pressure on our calendar year combined ratio. And we manage our expenses in order to ensure that we deliver on your expectations.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
Okay. And can you comment how many policy term in the case for that new business to not be in place?

A - Unidentified Speaker
Maybe I can help there. So, we have different policy life expectancy by different segment of business so what we call a Sam and inconsistently insured customers are not going to stick around long, so we need to make our 96 in a very short period of time. Robinsons going to stick a lot longer, so we have a lot more time to make up the combined ratio over 100 perhaps on new business for a Robinsons, so it depends upon the segment of business that we're talking about; lately, we've been growing with us on the Sam side more on the Robinsons side. So if you think about that dynamic hopefully that's helpful to your question.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
It does, thank you.

Our next question shall be from Meyer Shields from KBW. Meyer, your line is open.

Q - Meyer Shields{BIO 4281064 <GO>}
Great, thank you. Good morning. John mentioned that plan of two price more closely to the Snapshot curve and I assume that means maybe slightly like excess profit and faster growth compared to what we saw maybe heading into COVID and I think about that directionally correct?

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
I would say no, so when we say not specifically the curve we would balance that on the ends of the curve if you will. So early on with Snapshot when it was new for consumers, we weren't pricing to the maximum surcharge, we weren't pricing to the maximum discount in fact we didn't surcharge at all when we first brought out the model, now the consumers understand or accepting of it we can price to both ends of those spectrum. So, it doesn't change at all the aggregate 96 target we have for all segments of our business inclusive of Snapshot.

Q - Meyer Shields{BIO 4281064 <GO>}
Okay, great, thanks for the clarification and I guess the second issue. Tricia, you mentioned earlier in the call, not the first time that progressive generally (Inaudible) to taking significant rate increases, can you talk about the opportunity to sort of embed inflationary sensitive components into the exposure base? So that you don't have the same problem if something else is surprising.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean we tried to do that definitely in our reserving but in our pricing, we look at that and prospectively put that into our pricing model but this has been sort of an extraordinary few years with the inflationary especially, in our industry with used a new car prices and social inflation. So we do believe those big increases are past us and of course there could be a state where we have to have a bigger increase based on something else other than that, but we feel good about that. Do you have anything?

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Sure, we do have what we call monthly rating factors so we have some escalators in our auto pricing, they are not reflective of an inflationary environment in which we have seen recently, so you're doing this prospectively and it requires regulatory approvals. So we have what I'll call modest factors that inflate prices in many states not all on a monthly basis.

On the property side, we also have the value of the home that we are reflecting that renewal which lately for sure has led to higher renewal prices outside and increase as we take.

That's very helpful to your questions, right?

Q - Meyer Shields{BIO 4281064 <GO>}
It does, really I guess I would have acted more intelligently would be about the potential for embedding the same sort of thing that provides more premium automatically in property getting some of those in auto.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, I think we are at the monthly rating factors as well as the incremental increases and then all dwelling increases that John talked about on the property side.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah, the other piece we're doing to ensure we're more responsive on the auto frequency side is that continuous monitoring, so the more we drive people to adopt Snapshot or UBI rating and a continuous rating model, we can adapt more quickly to things that change and how they drive or how much they drive over time. So that provides a little more responsive than we have in today's model.
