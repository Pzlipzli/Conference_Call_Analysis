Presentation
Doug Constantine{BIO 22182643 <GO>}
Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's First Quarter Investor Event. I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations and I will be the moderator for today's event. The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website.

Although our quarterly investor relations, events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO are previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we'll use the balance of the 60 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions-and-answers with members of our leadership team.

As always discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2022, as supplemented by our 10-Q report for the first quarter 2023, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, Safe-Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face.

These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com.

To begin, today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith who will kick us off with some after introductory comments.

Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. One of the enduring lessons since the onset of the pandemic is the uncertainty of the future. Since March 2020, the world and our business have been pummeled by unforeseen events. In that vein is perhaps poetic that three years post pandemic we continue to have to manage through the unexpected in our business.

In the end I'm confident that our resilience, will see us through. Through the first quarter we were not on track to achieve our calendar year goal of 96 combined ratio. Given our extensive history of meeting our stated goal this has prompted many questions about how we got here, and where we're going.

As such, in a little bit more traditional opening statement I will instead provide answers to some questions that have been asked by the Investment Analysts. Our hope is that you will gain a clear understanding of how we are addressing the challenges as well as the urgency with which we are acting.

The first question is, how are you reacting to being above your target of 96 calendar year combined ratio. The answer to that is we will react the same way we always have, with speed and decisiveness. The three largest levers we have to manage our margin are to decrease our expense ratio, tighten our verification and underwriting scrutiny of new business and increase rates. I'll address these in that order.

Our largest controllable variable expense is advertising expense and we are taking action to reduce these costs, which we expect could both slow-growth and help to reduce our expense ratio. Once we are confident that we can deliver our target calendar year profitability, we will consider resuming our spend. While we won't provide details on which segments of media we are reducing or how this may affect growth going forward, I will tell you that we've invested in bringing the same industry-leading science from the pricing side of our business to the acquisition side and we'll continue to spend in the places that we believe have the greatest benefit to the business. Using non-rate actions such as tighter verification and underwriting standards and limiting build plan options will reduce our growth in this segments we believe we can currently rate at our target margins. Finally, our largest but slowest moving leverage rates, in-quarter one we took four points of rate in personal auto on an aggregate countrywide basis and we are still earning in some of the prior year rate increases. We plan to take aggressive rate increases where needed across all lines through the balance of 2023 to ensure we're pricing to deliver our target profit margins.

The next question, given the actions we will take to meet our profit target is what will this do to growth. First and foremost, keep in mind that growth in the first-quarter of 2023 was an all-time high for the company and we are very proud of that. Secondly, we are still in a very hard market with lots of consumer's quoting their insurance. We also continue to see ambient shopping. While policy growth may be slowed by our actions, we still anticipate there will continue to be robust demand for our products. Of course, the actions of our competitors also play a role in what growth will be. So I won't speculate on specific growth predictions. However, you can rest assured that we are focused on growing policies that we believe will meet or exceed our target margins.

Lastly, we have received many questions like this one, do you now believe your reserving is adequate? Or said another way, you said that you are confident that the biggest rate increases were behind you, what changed?

The answer is fairly basic, we started seeing data come in over the last few months that was not in line with what we were anticipating, which caused us to increase reserves and react with rate increases. In personal lines, our reserve strengthening have been largely in the short-tailed fixing vehicle coverages. In these coverages we can recognize and react to new trends relatively quickly and we feel good about our reserve levels today. That being said, reserves are estimates and change over-time based on evolving trends.

As for the effects of Florida House Bill 837, in March we estimated the reserve changes we believe we needed to capture the effect of the legislation, including the flood of lawsuits triggered by the law change. The reserve increases we took in March represented our best estimate of what we believe would be the full effect of the lawsuits on loss costs for pre bill accident period.

Going forward, we believe the legislation takes positive steps to help manage the cost of auto insurance for Florida consumers. However, the situation is evolving and we will continue to assess and react to information as it develops.

In commercial lines again, we believe adequately reserved today and are monitoring trends in frequency and severity to ensure we remain adequately reserved. Of course, any assumption on reserve adequacy comes with a caveat that trends can change, if they do, we will react to them as appropriate.

The follow-up to the reserving adequacy question is how did you miss reserving trends in the recent past and given that, how can you be confident in your current reserve adequacy. I'll address these questions individually.

The business of insurance is predicting the future. We never know our full-cost of goods sold until years after premiums are collected. As such, our reserves are by nature estimates of our exposures based on assumptions. We use historical data, extensive knowledge about our business in customers and advanced analytics to predict ultimate loss costs usually with an extremely high degree of accuracy. Predicting the future is hard however, and we didn't fully predict trends that developed during the quarter. We saw higher-than-expected severity trends in previously closed claims in personal auto, primarily in fixing vehicle coverages. While I won't speculate on why these trends changed, I can tell you that we reacted quickly and decisively to adjust our reserves for these short-tailed coverages.

I'm confident in the people and processes we have in place to ensure we're adequately reserved. For the five years ending 2022, prior year reserve development averaged about 0.25 points unfavorable on our year end combined ratio, which I believe, supports the statement that we always strive to set reserves adequately.

Hopefully these questions-and-answers address some of the most sought-after explanations in the first quarter. Rest assured that no one is more acutely aware of the results of the first quarter than myself, my team and all the people of Progressive. I continue to be confident in the long-term direction we're headed and I have little doubt we'll continue to do everything we can to achieve our goals.

Thank you again for joining us and I will now take your questions.

Questions And Answers
A - Doug Constantine{BIO 22182643 <GO>}
This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions. (Operator Instructions)

Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO. Mike, your line is now open.

Q - Mike Zaremski{BIO 22333535 <GO>}
Hey, good morning and thanks for the helpful prepared remarks. As a follow-up to the Florida comments, can you elaborate on the legislation? You said, the situation is evolving but you also said you you feel that the legislation is positive, so you know ultimately sometimes past has there been unless claims in Florida in April due to the legislation? Do you feel it has teeth and there could be a kind of a payback for the charges that were taken to the influx of claims?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Good question, Mike, thanks. So we think the long-term effects of the legislation as it's written today, will be very positive for the consumers of Florida. In the meantime, we're very familiar with the plaintiff bar and you know, we don't know that they will not try to challenge those. So what we did in March was we took a look at the fact that more lawsuits were being filed and every time we considered our cost, we look at is it estimable and probable, and that's why we strengthened the reserve for possible and likely lawsuits that are going to court between the time that the governor talked about the legislative bill and the time that he signed it. In fact, in March there were 280,000 lawsuits filed in Florida, not ours, overall in Florida, civil lawsuits, which is up nearly 130% since the all time high of May 2021, so significant lawsuits. So short-term, we are going to prepare to obviously get through those. Long-term this will be good.

So a couple of good things that came out of the House Bill 837, comparative loss changed from pure to modify comparative, so if you're greater than 50%, you don't collect. The statute limitations were from four years to two years. There's a Safe-Harbor for bad faith which is really important to us because it takes some time when you get into claim to actually gather the information to make, you know to actually start to negotiate if there is a demand and probably most importantly repealing one-way attorney fees. There's a little bit more than that, but we think those are really good. In the short-term though this could evolve and we don't know if it will be challenged. And so we will just react accordingly as we have more information. But overall, we feel very good about the law changes and we think it's really good, more importantly for the consumers in Florida.

Q - Mike Zaremski{BIO 22333535 <GO>}
Got it, that's helpful. And my final follow-up, I know you touched on this in your prepared remarks, but in pivoting to Personal Lines growth which has been excellent. I'm trying to juxtapose the comments you made, what we're seeing is that new applications that appear to be record levels with kind of your comments about needed to take maybe some corrective actions, it sounds like you still feel like Progressive will be a meaningful market-share taker. I don't want to put words in your mouth, would that be ultimately there's more shopping and on average Progressive's rates are lower than most of your customers. So as long as the industry is taking a lot of rate, you still feel good about the absolute level of growth?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean I think anytime you reduce advertising, the likelihood of growth subsiding a little bit is going to happen. We see that in our data, and we have seen our competitors take rate compared to us, and even more so - even more than us. So the hard market really it has to do with our people shopping and they are. So we do feel still bullish on our growth, let me give you a couple key stats because I didn't talk about those, I talked a little bit about the new apps which were tremendous, you know the all-time history of the company. But let me give you a couple of other interesting stats that we feel really incredible about.

So this quarter we grew policies in force $1.4 million. We grew premium $2.6 billion, which is approximately like one point of market-share. If you look at even like a 12 month span, we've grown more than $5 billion and if you think about that, that's the size of the top 10 carriers. So those are a couple, I think interesting and extraordinary tidbits that we feel good about. Also when you look at growth, you're going to look at both unit growth and premium growth. So maybe unit growth subsides a little bit, we really don't know. We just know that sometimes when you reduce advertising, when you increase advertising there is the inverse relationship, but there is also premium growth. So as we take more rate to get to our target profit margin, you're going to see some premium growth and ultimately, our goal is that, you'll also see our margins widen.

A - John Peter Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
The one point I would add is we don't live in a vacuum, obviously and our actions, I'd say all else equal, will certainly adversely affect growth, less advertising dollars, higher rates for sure. But as we saw last year, as the competitive marketplace was in a bit of disarray, even with our aggressive actions we saw growth. So it will remain to be seen what our competitors do in this environment that we are currently experiencing and if they react aggressively as well then obviously our growth won't be as adversely affected.

Q - Mike Zaremski{BIO 22333535 <GO>}
Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse your line is now open.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Thank you, good morning. My first question, I wanted to get some additional color on the magnitude of additional rates you guys are looking to take from here? In the 10-Q and in your comments you mentioned being aggressive with rates, raising rates over the remainder of the year or so. More specifically, like within personal auto, when you say aggressive rate, is that in the low-single digits, in the high-single-digits, can you just give us a sense of the magnitude of rate increases you're now expecting to take?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Sure, I assume they will come up, but I didn't give a number. We're going to take as much rate as we need to, to try to get to our target profit margin. I believe what we've shown not just over this inflationary period but over decades with Progressive, that we execute on our ability to do that. We have a great pricing group, a great rate revision group, so we know we can do that. Now there's all the caveats, regulatory approval, what can happen, you know, with weather, is it going to increase or decrease our desire to have more rates and of course it's very specific stay channel product, et cetera.

What I would say at this point in time and again all the caveat, that this is really quite a dynamic time. We think we'll take in the neighborhood of around 10 more points this year to catch-up and they had a trend in private passenger auto. So low-single digits. But again, that could be 8 to 12, we don't know right now, that's our plan as of today, we're watching as things unfold.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Okay, and then could you maybe break-down your business for us, the portion, you just said 8% to 12% price needed, but the portion of the book that needs rate versus perhaps the portion that you're still looking to grow in, is there a way to kind of give us a sense of which percentage? And I'm really concerned and I'm talking about personal auto, would still perhaps be where you might be looking to grow versus the portion where you just think you need these aggressive level of rate?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, from an auto perspective, we always want to grow as fast as we can, but we are limited, sometimes with the regulatory approvals. So obviously there are places where we haven't got as much rate as we've needed, think the coast, which we've talked about before, going to need more on those because we've been waiting for some rate increases in some of those states, some are less, where we feel like we're ahead of that. We don't really want to go into details, but suffice it to say, on a countrywide average we think in the neighborhood, about 10% additional this year.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Thank you.

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thanks, Elyse.

Operator
Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian, your line is now open.

Q - Brian Meredith{BIO 3108204 <GO>}
Yes, thanks, a couple of them here for you, Tricia. The first one, Tricia, I remember back to 2016 and all of the discussion about new business penalty as you were growing pretty rapidly. What's the impact of that new business penalty on your personal auto results today or in this quarter?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Well I think in this quarter, you know, our media expenses, obviously we're going to feel that especially on the direct side since we front-load those costs. And I think I said this in the last call, I sort of look at new business penalty as an investment in our future and having our future policy holders, but we did see a higher expense ratio and we still had our pedal on for immediate spend in the first quarter this year, so yeah, expenses were higher.

Q - Brian Meredith{BIO 3108204 <GO>}
I was thinking more on loss ratio side actually just because new business typically, carries loss ratio.

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, the business does carry a higher loss ratio, that was part of it as well. Including a lot of things that happened in the first quarter, record level compared to last five years with weather losses, et cetera. But yeah, there is a penalty there as well, anytime we have new business.

Q - Brian Meredith{BIO 3108204 <GO>}
Okay, thanks. And then my second question, I'm just curious if I adjust for the reserving actions taken in personal auto in the first quarter, I come up that you kind of like a 94 combined ratio excess reserving actions, still below the 96. I guess my question is that why you are having to tap the brakes right now given that you're kind of at a 94 Axos PYD [ph], which I'm assuming you're expecting that to happen here going forward?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, it's that balance, Brian, of our calendar year commitment and our lifetime cohort commitment. And so there is, you know, we're always thinking about the future, we're always trying to balance it, and I would say we're not putting on the brakes. We're definitely going to reduce our media spend, but our intentions are that we would still want to grow.

I just wanted to say that normally when we reduce media, it could have anticipated slowing in growth. Now John just mentioned too, a lot depends on what is happening with competitors, we're still seeing a lot of ambient shopping, we are still seeing a very hard market. So our intentions are to get to our calendar year '96 and literally, you know as soon as we can, if we get to that depending on, again on weather, regulatory things, et cetera, we can very easily ramp-up our media spend to grow. So it's really that balance of accident year calendar year commitments.

Q - Brian Meredith{BIO 3108204 <GO>}
Great, thank you.

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thanks, Brian.

Operator
Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Andrew, your line is now open.

Q - Andrew Kligerman{BIO 1551668 <GO>}
Thank you, good morning. Tricia you cited overall severity up about 10%, so I'm trying to unpack the piece that, you cited the repair category being the most severe could you specify a number around that? And the second part of it is noticed the Manheim Index sequentially up 8.6% in the first quarter. So that was a big move, how are you thinking about used-car prices as the year moves forward?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, really good question. There is a lot that goes into the severity of fixing cars. And so, a couple of things. We have really, and I think as an industry struggled with shop capacity. So our ability to get cars in, in the throughput to get them out, which could of course have effect on length of time rental, et cetera. Prices are up just a little bit under 3% and labor rates. So think of unemployment rate and how there is a problem kind of hiring everywhere, same thing with mechanical tax in the body shops, but those repair rates are up between 4.5% from 5%, so that's some contributions.

And then really the parts prices, the cost of those haven't really abated either. So what we're really working to do, our President of Claims is working with our body shop partners to open up capacity and get those cars in and out, and of course weather exacerbates that as well. So we still haven't seen - the Manheim went down a little bit, but again it pops up and then the high over the last several years is extraordinary. So that's kind of the trends we're reacting to, again, the good part about this is these are short-tailed. So we can react to them really quickly, which we have and then we can continue to watch trends to determine, have we taken enough rate for what we need now and the future.

Q - Andrew Kligerman{BIO 1551668 <GO>}
I see and you've mentioned non-rate actions, particularly for commercial and I think you may have touched on it in personal, but given the non rate actions have kind of been a part of the practice for the last couple of years, is there really much leverage there non-rate actions?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, I would say there's a lot of leverage, especially on the commercial side and. I won't go into all what we're working on with restrictions on new business, et cetera, but yeah, we're able to pretty quickly put those into play and to make sure that the new business we're bringing on reach our target profit margins.

Q - Andrew Kligerman{BIO 1551668 <GO>}
Okay, thanks a lot.

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thank you, Andrew.

Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan. Jimmy your line is now open.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar{BIO 4278955 <GO>}
Hi, good morning. So first the question on advertising, and if you can talk about or quantify how much you're pulling back on advertising and is it in specific regions or are you doing it throughout the country?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, we won't share exactly where we're pulling back, just like we don't share our budget and actually where our budget goes to whether it's mass media or digital, but I will say when we pulled back on advertising we have an incredible media book, media group, and they will look at the most inefficient media and pull-back accordingly. So that's something that we can dial-up or down depending on what's happening with our profit margins. So while we won't share that, we can more easily turn local off if we need to, if we can't get rate et cetera. So that's kind of the approach we take to our media. We're really flexible and nimble as we've shown in the past.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar{BIO 4278955 <GO>}
Okay and then, can you talk about the pricing environment and how conducive is the regulatory environment for adjusting prices because I think as companies are raising in the 2021 period there is a lot of pushback from regulators. Is the regulatory environment better for price increases now than it was before or do you still expect pushback from regulators and delays in the process of raising prices?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I think most of the regulators really do see and are watching these trends and it's not Progressive along, it's definitely the industry seeing these inflationary trends continue and so for the majority, we show the data, they understand what we need for our prospective rates.

There's always going to be some challenges and we continue to have challenges, like I said, if you take the two states on each coast that we always have a challenge with. But you know what, we're working with the departments of insurance to show and share our data and the need for it, because in the long run what we want to have is competitive prices. That's what makes our industry great. And we want to have available and affordable coverage for people in every state, so availability is really important. We know that and so we're going to continue to work with the regulators to get that, but there's always a couple of states that could be challenging.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar{BIO 4278955 <GO>}
Thank you.

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thanks, Jimmy.

Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Alex your line is now open.

Q - Alex Scott{BIO 20003952 <GO>}
Hi, good morning. First one I had is just on frequency trends and I think they've run reasonably favorable for you over the last 12 months and just how they have contributed to loss trend. So I just wanted to see if there is any sort of evolving view there and how that will play-out and what you saw in 1Q, if you have any update?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean frequency in Q1 was relatively flat. We haven't quite seen it come back necessarily to solidly pre COVID. It's really hard to flush out frequency trends because there are so many macroeconomic things that go into, we kind of just try to react to it. And there's always a little bit of noise in one quarter, so we'll continue to watch how frequency goes, we obviously we have a lot of data from miles driven, vehicle miles traveled from our UVI data, so we watch for that, but that's something that we watch and react to and there's a lot of inputs and a lot that we don't control.

Q - Alex Scott{BIO 20003952 <GO>}
Understood. Okay, thank you. And as a follow-up I just wanted to ask on bodily injury severity. If you have any update, have you learned anything through 1Q on that front? It sounds like the decisions you're making in terms of ad spend and growth and so forth and rate are more property damage severity driven, but I just wanted to make sure that there wasn't more of a bodily injury component to this.

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, bodily injury has started to be relatively stable over the last several quarters. Some of the severity increases we saw in Q1 had to do with our large losses, what we call Stanley [ph], which is soft-tissue attorney rep non lit and some closing of soft-tissues. So we're able to discern that pretty deeply and watch for that and of course, obviously, those trends can change as well. But it's been fairly stable and I think attorney rep levels are stabilized a little bit more Q, of course, I'll go to Florida because Florida is a big state, one of our biggest states. So that could change as well depending on how many lawsuits we ultimately get based on House Bill 837.

Q - Alex Scott{BIO 20003952 <GO>}
Understood. Thank you.

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}

Thanks for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler, Paul your line is now open.

Q - Paul Newsome{BIO 1541286 <GO>}
Good morning, thanks for the call. A little bit of a follow up, I was a little surprised not to hear commentary on distracted driving and faster driving being kind of an issue with the reserve issues and it seems like it's all sort of pieces actually fixing things in the process of the shopping. Is that part of the equation as well or is that sort of stabilized as well?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Well, it's hard to discern distracted driving solely on it's own. So we look at so many different variables and obviously we have a lot of data from our usage-based insurance, from our snapshot to kind of understand the different variables and there a relatedness to that. So if you think about distracted driving, and how it could relate to heartbreak, so we don't look at distracted driving only. So we were just talking before the call on how many more accidents we see. What we can react to though is the data where we are - this is exactly what we're seeing in terms of accidents, frequency, vehicle miles traveled, congestion. So we look at all of that to understand what's happening and react to that, but I wouldn't say I would have any really further commentary specifically on distracted driving.

Q - Paul Newsome{BIO 1541286 <GO>}
And then separately, can you talk a little bit about the commercial business, it looked like the big picture that maybe it was all the same trends affecting private passenger auto, but that necessarily hasn't been in the past. So is that the case or all these kind of comments about where the reserve issues are and where the severity is happening in the commercial business as well or is there a difference that's notable between the two businesses from a trend perspective?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes, our commercial lines, especially when you look at the reserve was mostly in our core auto and they're seeing very similar trends and in the trucking segment, those are expensive to fix as well. And from the perspective of reserving we're seeing a little bit more late reports in our reps, our case reserves or just strengthening from a rep oerspective but pretty similar trends.

Q - Paul Newsome{BIO 1541286 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Always appreciate help.

Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David, your line is now open.

Q - David Motemaden{BIO 18818634 <GO>}
Hi, thanks, good morning. Tricia, just on roughly 10 points of rate that you need to take, I think that's an addition to the four points that you already took this year, but correct me if I'm wrong on that. Could you just talk about how much of that is, you had mentioned a catch-up versus just what's needed to keep pace with trend?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, it was additional to the rate that we took in quarter one. I won't go into actually talking exactly about what's catchup et cetera because we also look at rates prospectively. But we believe at this point with what we're seeing that that will get us both of those. So it will get us to the point where we are at our target profit margin eventually, hopefully, and rate to come, you know, to stay ahead of trends specifically.

Q - David Motemaden{BIO 18818634 <GO>}
Got it. And then just it sounds like you guys are still intending to grow and still feel pretty good about growth despite the lower ad spend. Am I right to interpret that, that when you think about how the rate adequacy, you're not that far off on the existing prices out there and so you feel good about the dynamic?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. I do feel good about growth and someone asked the question about underwriting scrutiny and that's where you can really make sure that you gather more data to be more confident that the new business you're bringing on reaches your target profit margins. So we do feel comfortable with the growth with the caveats of making sure that we do some extra scrutiny, just to make sure that new business for the future is profitable. Pat, Luke, do yoiu have anything to weigh in?

A - Pat Callahan{BIO 1416552 <GO>}
And just a little other color commentary on Q1's growth. So half of the incredible new business growth we had was from conversion improvements and in the agency channel it's more like three quarters. So when you talk about how competitive our prices are on the street, that's a pretty good indication that even with some media pull back, we will continue to have strong competitive rates and with higher levels of ambient shopping, feel pretty good about continuing to grow the business.

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, what I always loved, and we've talked about this the other day in one of my meetings is, every time a situation like this happens and this has been such an incredibly volatile three years when you pull-back on advertising expenses you always learn something. So we try to take advantage of these times as well the learn something about our advertising and efficiency, et cetera. So we continue to do that as well, just as another comment.

A - John Peter Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
David, your question on catch-up versus forward-looking our pricing is always forward-looking. And as we mentioned in Tricia's introductory comments, clearly we're a little off in terms of severity for fixing cars coming into the year that obviously was dialed into our indications. We've seen additional data points as she mentioned we are dialing that into our future trends select.

There was also discussion around Manheim. Our projections around Mannheim, if you look back for it to come down more aggressively than it has, it has been car pricing in general has stayed higher than we had anticipated a while back, that all goes into our future trends selects. When we are doing our pricing indications we've obviously dial those up recently and that's where we've arrived at the conclusion that we need to get more aggressive on rate.

Q - David Motemaden{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Tracy your line is now open.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
Good morning. Since higher severity on auto physical damage was a key driver behind adverse development in the quarter, can you reconcile how you got comfortable lowering your view of auto physical damage loss trend this quarter to 15% versus 20% last year?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I can give you a color of why we believe there is to higher severity this quarter, and there's always a lot of noise in the quarter, but much of what you're seeing with the higher versus collision has to do with some older claims that are now working its way through our inbound subrogation. So if you think about claims at the height of ACV et cetera working through those. So that would be my point about that property damage severity trend.

I'm not sure if I answered your question.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
Yeah, in your Q or your K, you break-out all the components of loss trend, so within severity. I just noticed in the Q, auto physical damage was up 15%. I look at the 10-K, it was 20% last year. Directionally, it looks like it's down. It doesn't seem to reconcile with the comments made earlier on the call and adverse development taken in the quarter, so I just wanted to understand why you took down your view of loss trend within auto physical damage.

A - Pat Callahan{BIO 1416552 <GO>}
Thank you. Maybe a clarification. That's not our view of loss trend there that is a retrospective looking numbers. So that is simply saying physical damage severity this quarter versus last year first quarter. Similarly, when you looked at last year's numbers. So it's a consecutive retrospective metric. Does that help?

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
Okay. And so with 20% even be the right number to think about for last year, given all the adverse development you taken in that accident year or its not correlated?

A - Pat Callahan{BIO 1416552 <GO>}
So we corelate it with providing you a versus the previous period change in severity there. So we not only provide you the quarter and the year-to-date and so right now, we're up 15% versus previous quarter for property damage. So you mentioned physical damage, property damage is the third-party coverage for fixing cars.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Josh, your line is now open.

Q - Josh Shanker{BIO 5292022 <GO>}
Yes, thank you for taking my question. If you go back two years ago to this conference call after the 1Q 2021 10-Q, you announced that you were taking rate and when we saw May 2021 results, growth had just ground to a halt. You had very little regulatory approval at that point, very little premium written or earned at new rates and you were able to stop the growth almost immediately.

What were some of the skills that you had that you were able to do that before you were even taking the rate and what aren't you going to do this time compared to the urgency that you were able to stop the growth in 2021?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, we're going to use similar levers and that's what I tried to answer in my opening question-and-answer session. At that point, regulators, we were ahead of the curve, ahead of the competition. So regulators were still, I think, worried about the effects, did people give enough back with our COVID et cetera which I I'm very proud of all that we did with that. But very similar levers that we used last-time. I think also what we're seeing now though is that this is a very hard market. So I think both Pat and John talked about the rate increases that our competitors are taking, which is still causing some shopping. So even though we'll use similar levers we've been able to grow as like I gave you some of the stats first quarter. And so we believe that that may continue depending again on what competition does.

I think regulators started seeing way more companies come in with very similar data and they know that if they want to have available coverage for their constituents that we have to put through the system. It's just the bottomline what we're seeing from an inflationary trend.

Q - Josh Shanker{BIO 5292022 <GO>}
All right. And then in the 10-Q, you mentioned that the current year impact of HB 837 with less than a 100 basis-points on the quarter. Can I extrapolate that it was 200 or 300 basis-points for the month of March?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, you probably could, I haven't really done the math on that, but what we did is we looked at what we thought would be probable and estimable based on the thought of losses that happened in a short period of time before the Bill was signed. And again, that could evolve because some of those things may or may not actually happen. But yeah, that amount is probably pretty accurate. And again, that's something that will continue to evolve.

Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Yaron, your line is now open.

Q - Yaron Kinar{BIO 17146197 <GO>}
Thank you, good morning. My first question, looking at just the tremendous growth we've seen quarter-to-date, during [inaudible] weighting of Sam's Vans, Rites, Robinsons among those customers that were added and even among new applications like, are those roughly - is that distribution roughly in line with what you have in the in force books.

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah. I think we're out in the Q and Pat or John can weigh in on this I think we grew in all segments. I think we've increased in Robinsons from a auto home bundle. Sam's are going to be more likely to continue to shop. So there's always the PLA part of that, but I think we grew in again all segments.

A - Pat Callahan{BIO 1416552 <GO>}
Yeah, that's right. From an app perspective, we saw a positive growth in the quarter for new apps across all segments and our fastest growth was really in the Rites and Robinsons and Diane's also grew, and Sam's grew just a little slower, but they grew as well. From our PEF perspective, we also saw positive growth across all segments during the quarter. So faster in the segments that are not Sams, but.

A - John Peter Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
And just for those unfamiliar with our nomenclature. Rites are homeowners who don't bundle with us. So Robinsons as well-known I think by this audience, Rites are homeowners who have their auto insurer, perhaps some other products with us as well. And that's where we've actually grown the fastest and in the agency channel especially where we are limited to our, what we think it was our manufactured or underwritten property product, Progressive Home, we have been pulling back in a number of markets to revise our geographic footprint and it's encouraging to see that we are still growing with home owning households even though in a lot of markets where we're restricting the property piece of that portfolio. So we're still growing in Robinsons as well as Pat pointed out and Diane's as what we think of as renters who are stable in their ensuring habits. So growing more in the more stable sectors and growing homeowners considerably even without the bundle which is also encouraging to see.

Q - Yaron Kinar{BIO 17146197 <GO>}
Thank you. And then my next question, I guess goes back to I think several other versions of these questions that were asked on the call already and I'm just looking at the comments coming in to my email over the course of this call. It seems like there is still some lingering investor confusion around what I would say maybe is the sense of urgency and aggressiveness coming from you talking about kind of the need to take some corrective actions. And the year-to-date data that we're seeing, namely 95ish combined ratio when we take-out some of the reserve adjustments that we'd assume will not go forward. So I was hoping to maybe take another stab at this, give you another opportunity to maybe clarify some of that confusion.

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah, it's really all about our calendar year goal. So we appreciate the fact that we will look at our long-term growth as long as, as well as our short-term growth. But we've had a very long-stated goal for our long-term holders for our investment community that we will do everything we can treat your calendar year '96, and we're not there, or to 99, and so that's why we're taking aggressive action. The great part is, we have lots of levers that we can quickly move and our nimbleness specifically here Progressive will be the benefit.

So things turn-around dramatically in the next four months. Again the caveats are regulatory approval, weather, inflationary trends, we'll be able to put us on growth, but also and that's why I gave those stats at the beginning, the growth has been unbelievable. And we don't think it's going to come to a screeching halt. We know that there is a relationship between advertising and new business apps, but we're still feeling positive.

So I hope my letter, the Q and my comments didn't say this growth is going to come to a screeching halt. What I wanted to do is just say, hey, that that can very well happen when we reduce advertising and always has in the past. To what degree is very dependent on all those things, including competition.

Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi. Michael, your line is now open.

Q - Mike Ward{BIO 1495444 <GO>}
Thanks guys, good morning. I noticed policy life expectancies trended positively in the quarter. Just hoping you could help us understand what goes into that metric and how should we think about that trending now your raising prices again and have added a lot of new customers?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Well, it turned positive on a three of trailing three, it's still down on trailing 12, we think trailing three is more indicative of what's happening. Again that may and could change depending on the rate increases, that's usually what we see happen. The PLE is just our likelihood for our customer, the length of time our customers are likely to stay. So the trailing three is more recent activity. We'll have to continue to watch that trend trying to see if any of our rate actions affect that negatively.

Q - Mike Ward{BIO 1495444 <GO>}
Thanks very much. And then on the investment portfolio I was just hoping if you could provide some color on the strategy and CMBS. I know there is new disclosure in the Q, just specifically curious why you guys favor single property CMBS especially office? I'm wondering if you could sort of comment on the sales that you mentioned in the Q thus far.

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Absolutely. I'll have John Bauer weigh in, but I will say, we added the chart in on the Q for CMBS, this year, and I'll say that, John was ahead of the curve in terms of starting to reduce our risks in CMBS over a year ago. I'll let him walk through on why he did that and where we're headed from here, John.

A - John Peter Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Yes, thanks so much for the question, Michael. So just to take a step back and then I'll try to hit it specifically as possible. About the first quarter 2022, when we looked at the portfolio and we looked at the overall macro-environment, we thought that the portfolio we came into early 2022 didn't match our macro views going forward.

So several actions that we looked to take at that point. So first of all, on the interest rate side, we sort of ended January around three and an eighth on our interest-rate duration, we thought that was too high given the environment. So we allowed that to shift down throughout the year to about 275 by October and then look to move that back up again to three.

On the equity side, we thought overall, given what the Fed's actions likely to be that equities were likely to see more volatility than we've seen in the past, and therefore look to reduce our equity exposure, pretty much cut in half to what we are right now. And then we looked across our non sort of cash and treasury fixed-income portfolio and said if we hit a recession where is it that we think that we would be most uncomfortable and the three areas that we sort of identified to watch and that we want to whole taking any further credit risk was residential mortgage-backed securities, CLOs and commercial mortgage-backed securities. I would say in the 12 months since then as many of you witnessed the housing market has probably performed better than many thought and the same has been true within our residential mortgage-backed securities. So even though that shrunk as a portion of our portfolio, we think that housing market is better than we thought.

In terms of CLOs, we'd say it's still to-be-determined what the corporate default rate looks like going-forward, but feel very comfortable with our position there, even though it's smaller versus last year. And then it takes us to commercial mortgage-backed securities. In that portfolio as opposed to just not adding and allowing the run-off to happen, we prospectively looked at the portfolio and said if we were to hit a recession which are the securities in here that we think in a severe recession could get hit.

And with that, we looked over the last year to reduce out of those securities. And as you can see year-on year CMBS represented about 13% of the portfolio at the end-of-the first-quarter of 2022, it represents less than 8% of the portfolio right now. So what encompasses that, we felt like we wanted to give the disclosure.

On the office side, two major drivers of that portfolio. The first thing is trophy office. So these are offices that were built-in the last 10 years or so that our view was would have significant demand especially as different companies looked to shrink their footprint but looked to be in the best quality buildings. And then the second part of the portfolio is If it's not trophy office, we would it leased at least four to five years past maturity to incredibly strong investment-grade tenant, and so that makes up the core of the portfolio with a single-asset portfolio. It allows us to look and pick individual buildings that we would underwrite as opposed to a conduit type thing, where you have a lot of different type of quality of buildings that we think are a lot lesser than they are in the single-asset side. S

O with that and as we mentioned disclosure we have no delinquencies in the portfolio, we have about $350 million of maturities over the next year in the overall CMBS portfolio and we expect them even in this type of environment, all to be refinanced without a problem.

I don't know if that answers your question, but please let me know if I can give you any more specific.

Q - Mike Ward{BIO 1495444 <GO>}
Yeah, no, that was tremendously helpful. Maybe just on what you said it, recently, in recent quarters, [inaudible], California, Seattle.

A - John Peter Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Yeah, so I would take it a lot more broadly than that. Again for us, and this I would since we have the opportunity to talk to you, I would say this across our portfolio, not just in commercial real-estate, what we are constantly doing is looking and saying, are we getting paid for the risk that we're taking in this security or that one. For CMBS in particular, it was the first thing going back to February March of last year, is there any tenant rollover where we think this building could be vacant coming into their maturity. So get rid of that one. Is there any buildings where we don't think the owners are going to put the money into the building in order to get it to the quality to lease-up, get rid of that one.

And so what that left us with broadly across the portfolio was trophy real-estate and then ones that have really strong tenancy, five years or longer past the maturity. So I wouldn't focus geography-by-geography necessarily, a more on what's the quality of the building, what's the quality of the tenancy, and I think that's what left us with a portfolio with no delinquencies where we feel confidence and the next 12 months of maturities.

Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan your line is now open.

Q - Ryan Tunis{BIO 16502263 <GO>}
Yes, just a couple here, so I guess the first question on the 10 points of rate. So when we go back like a year ago I think it was on this call where you guys said you had done taking outsized rate increases. I guess since then you guys never stopped taking rate increases. I think since then you've gotten like 9 points in the aggregate. So I guess when I think about it like this extra 10 points that you're saying the need over the next three quarters and thinking about the fact you've actually taken almost that much. Like in the trailing four quarters, that really just doesn't seem like that much of a step-up versus what we're seeing. Just your comments on whether or not I'm thinking about that correctly.

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean what we prefer to do is, obviously, we want to be ahead of the rates to achieve our target profit margins. We prefer to take small bites of the apple, which we did in first quarter, but then we saw the data changed dramatically. And so for our future rate need we believe at this point that around 10 rates is sort of the neighborhood what we need on the private passenger auto side, so I think you're thinking about it, okay I mean what we said in the quarter is that we thought the largest rate increases are behind us. But this has been a really volatile time and so we're just reacting to what we're seeing right now.

A - John Peter Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
I would just add that.

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Hold on, John wanted to add a comment.

A - John Peter Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
I was just going to say, overtime, we have been very well-served analyzing the data very expeditiously and taking action as we see changes. So as Tricia mentioned if things don't play-out in terms of loss trend as we are expecting, we can always pullback we can always even take rate down. I would not be surprised if we do that, but we can certainly pull-back. But continually we find we are way better-off looking at the data, every single month and to the extent we think things have changed taking action expeditiously.

Q - Ryan Tunis{BIO 16502263 <GO>}
Got it and then I've got a couple of questions on just whether or not there might be like an adverse selection going on, if you could just comment on where you're seeing the loss trend the issues in the book, would you say it's disproportionately toward the new business that you put on or are you kind of talking about that broadly across the book?

A - Susan Patricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
No, I mean I think where adverse selection comments comes into play specifically, is for those companies that have industry-leading segmentation and we believe we have that. We believe we have that with our variables, with our UBI et cetera, so we actually feel good that we talked a little bit about the underlying loss costs. We feel pretty good about that. There just some trends that we're seeing that we need to get ahead of. Our goal, of course, is to rate accurately and be aggressive in getting the right rates at the right time on the street. And if you do that and you have segmentation like we do, adverse selection should happen but not to us. Hold on, Pat wants to make a comment.

A - Pat Callahan{BIO 1416552 <GO>}
The only thing I would add on the mix of business that we're getting in the quality is to the contrary, we feel very good about the quality of business we put on during fourth quarter and first quarter. We are constantly paranoid, we always watch and we look closely to ensure that the mix that's being shed by our competitors as they transfer market-share to us, we watch closely and we are seeing clean business we're seeing homeowner business as John mentioned, long prior insurance period, multicar. So it's exactly the business that we intend to grow with and we're pretty happy with what we're seeing contrary to any adverse selection.
