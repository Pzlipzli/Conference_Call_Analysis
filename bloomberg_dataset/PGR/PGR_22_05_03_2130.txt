Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Anniversaries are a natural time to look back on the past and since this is the first investor call of Progressives 85th year. I wanted to do just that. We have grown from a scrappy startup trying to find a foothold in the great depression to the 10th largest homeowners carrier. The third-largest personal auto carrier and the number one commercial auto carrier. In just the last five years our total company-wide written premium has nearly doubled.

Nowhere has growth been more remarkable than in commercial lines which just passed a major milestone of over $9 billion and written premiums on a trailing 12-month basis. We grew commercial auto premiums over 200% in the last five years. All while generally achieving a better than average industry profit margin and ended March just shy of $1 million commercial lines policies in force. It is truly been an incredible run with significant opportunity still waiting to be captured. Congratulations to the commercial lines team and thank you to all Progressive employees and customers who have made the last 85 years so, extraordinary.

Throughout our 85-year history, we've worked through many hard and soft markets and we continue to address the hard market we're in today. While some industry suggest the value of used vehicle is leveling or even beginning to decline used vehicle values are still significantly above those of early 2021. Study, but increasing trend in bodily injury severity has also contributed to the increase in lost cause we've experienced.

Further as a country emerge from the Omicron wave, we saw personal auto vehicle miles traveled recovered to fourth quarter 2021 levels which were in the 9 to 10% range below the pre-pandemic baseline. Our response to these trends have been to reduce marketing expenses, increase underwriting scrutiny limit bill plan options. Options and in the first quarter, we implemented rate increases of seven points and personal auto the cylinder in, which is an addition to the 8 points, we took in 2021. While we're making progress. We still have more work to do to ensure all of our state's reach rate adequacy. Our rate and non-rate actions have had the expected effect on personal auto-growth, while personalized lines PIF growth is still positive on a year-over-year basis.

Sequential PIF growth is negative new application are down year-over-year and a policy life expectancy is also declining. When we look across all the metrics we track, it seems likely that were ahead of our competitors and increasing rates which explains a large part of our slowdown in growth. As we look forward to the rest of 2022, we're optimistic, as more states reach rate adequacy. We expect to be able to increase marketing spend and re-engage the growth engine because of the advantages, we believe we have in the way we buy media, we can adjust marketing spend at the local and segment level and in such a way to ensure the new business, we write meets our economic goals. And since we believe, we are ahead of the competitors and taking the right actions. We hope to continue our long-term trend or writing more than our fair share of quotes. Even as we face these macroeconomic pressures. We have not slowed our pursuit of segmentation superiority.

Our U.S. Personal Auto product model is now available in over eight, and over half the states in the showing early promising results especially among more preferred segments. We have also further expanded the footprint of our 4.1 homeowners product into four additional states in the first quarter, bringing the total to 12. Our new normal since the onset of the pandemic has been disruptions in the economy that is buffeted our business. While there are many paths to future can take, I'm confident in our strategy and our people and believe our greatest successes are still to come in the next 85 years. Thank you. I'll take your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)

(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from J..P Morgan. Jimmy your line is open.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar{BIO 4278955 <GO>}
Hi. Good morning. So I had a question first just on the pricing environment and what your expectations are in terms of getting price hikes through all the states? Because I think some of the states like California has obviously been reluctant to raise -- to give permission to raise prices. Are you seeing any changes in that at all or do you expect changes over the next few months?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
We still have some challenges in a few states including the one you mentioned and we're working closely with regulators to get the rate that we need. Our desire is to be able to be more open to open up our billplan options to open up -- to loosen our underwriting restrictions. And once we get that rate, we can start to have that growth engine move. So we've got a couple states that we're still working with, a couple big states that we've had some success in and why we feel pretty optimistic about the future.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar{BIO 4278955 <GO>}
And the reluctance of California and some of the states that have been difficult is it just because of the strong results company has had in 2020 and early 21 or is there something else behind it?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Specifically California is a little bit how they look back versus perspective and so I think the data is showing that these are real trends -- inflationary trends and the need across the industry is very significant. And we want to be open for Californians and will work closely with the regulators to make that happen.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar{BIO 4278955 <GO>}
Okay. And then just on the claims trend in January and February. Do you think your business saw a benefit from the Omicron wave at all in the early parts of the first quarter?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I don't know if there's a huge benefit. Things opened up a little bit more, but still vehicle miles traveled and frequency is still below pre-pandemic levels. Would you want to add anything on that?

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
In January and February, we did see the vehicle miles traveled drop a little relative to the fourth quarter of 2021. We've seen that since return in March. So a very modest benefit if any at all.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar{BIO 4278955 <GO>}
Okay. And then just lastly, have you changed anything in terms of how you're investing in this environment? Any sort of major classes that you're de-emphasizing or conversely where you're seeing good value?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I'll talk a little bit about are investing guidelines and John Bowers [ph] on the phone. John if you want to add anything, let me know. We've had a long standing approach to our investing and that is we don't want to target a certain book yield or level of investment income for that matter. We want to earn the best risk adjusted rate of return on our portfolio and most importantly John's team, their most important job is to protect the balance sheet that way the operating company can grow as profitably and as fast as possible. John, do you want to add anything?

A - Unidentified Speaker
Yes. Thanks, Tricia. I would only add to that obviously the environment is pretty dynamic right now. And we continue to search out for good opportunities that would create long-term value for the portfolio, but always with a focus on number one, protecting the capital and then getting the best total return that we can in the portfolio.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar{BIO 4278955 <GO>}
Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Andrew, please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Kligerman{BIO 1551668 <GO>}
Hey. Thank you. Good morning. Regarding the underwriting restrictions that you mentioned, could you give a little color on what in particular you're doing there?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes, Andrew. First of all, I enjoyed your ride up last week, welcome to PNC insurance, and there are couple different underlying restrictions. So we look at gathering additional data possibly if we have more questions on a customer. So we call it pre-binding verification. So we may ask a little more specifics to make sure we have the garaging adjust right and things like that. Do you want to add anything Pat?

A - Patrick Callahan{BIO 19087798 <GO>}
No. I think that's exactly what we do is when we want to be certain, we've got all the underwriting characteristics accurately reported. We will have some additional follow-up questions for customers both at new business and then occasionally at renewal. Additionally, we will put restrictions on how open we are from a bill plan perspective and other things. Just as we look at overall profitability, we want to make sure we're getting the right rate for our new business customers at inception.

Q - Andrew Kligerman{BIO 1551668 <GO>}
And as a result of these initiatives, what percentage of your book ends up with a or has ended up with a rate change over the last quarter and maybe even the last 12 months as you've gone through these underwriting restrictions?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Well, I think it's more of a entering in and getting the right rate at inception. So we've had a higher percentage of customers that once we have the additional information, we have blocked and they likely gone somewhere else because we don't have the accurate information.

Q - Andrew Kligerman{BIO 1551668 <GO>}
I see. And any sense of proportion on that, Tricia, that you could give us, like how much of your book you're seeing that on?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Probably I would say of incoming close probably double-digit low.

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Low double-digits, which is up from sort of half that when we were more comfortable with underwriting margin. So what we're trying to do here is ensure that every piece of new business coming in the door is going to be profitable for us. We understand that there's a distribution on our pricing. So on the tail where we're less sure that we're going to make money that is we're going to ask a lot more questions and frequently those questions lead to the customer seeking insurance elsewhere. That is more frequently the outcome than an adjustment in the overall premium because frankly some customers are looking to achieve a lower premium by not answering the questions accurately. So some of these efforts are focused on that segment. By pushing that segment to our competitors, obviously, we ensure that we're profitable and to the extent our competitors do not employ such methods, it will affect our competitors adversely.

Q - Andrew Kligerman{BIO 1551668 <GO>}
Got it. And just lastly on commercial lines. You noted in the letter that it was a remarkable 63% growth. Is there optimism that you can continue to grow in the double-digits and what would give you that optimism?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Well, that growth was significant for a couple different reasons. So we did grow double-digits in all of our business marketing tiers and we still are growing significantly in FHT and for higher transportation based on, still a massive amount of goods being moved across the country since the pandemic. In addition to that, about half of that increase came from our transportation network renewal. So we had one of our partners, we went from 6 months to 12 months policy. So that obviously is significant. We increased our projected mileage, which is how we compute our premium. So that was part of the increase. We had rate increases to reflect the inflationary environment and fourth, we seeded last to our reinsures. So about half that increase was in TNC.

So all that said, even if on the commercial, the BMTs that we have now, the five on commercial, even if they slow down a little bit, the great part about what we've been doing and you wrote about this over the last several years is thinking about the future. So we just are getting going on our BOP, our business owners policy small business, continue to grow there. We have 37 new states being rolled out and three new states actually in this year. We have our fleet program where we've expanded the number of power units that we write from 10 to 40. We have the acquisition of Protective, so medium to larger fleet.

So how we think about really business in all -- at least horizon 1 and 2 for now and ultimately we'll do that in horizon 3 is how do we continue to have growth even if maybe one segment of that business may slowdown or may fluctuate based on macroeconomic conditions. So I'm excited about all the opportunities in commercial lines because we've spent the last 4, 5 years investing in the future.

Q - Andrew Kligerman{BIO 1551668 <GO>}
Thanks so much.

Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is open.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, I was hoping that you could quantify what percent of premiums the states represent or you think the majority of rate increase is behind you? And then associated with that question what gives you guys the confidence to make that statement about rate versus forward lost trend given there's just so much uncertainty still with both frequency and severity?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. I probably would dissect all the states. I would say that we feel pretty positive that one, we got ahead of competitors which we think is important and has been important in the past and we're watching trends closely. I don't -- the crystal ball I wish we had would help us, but we'll watch those trends. We still are watching labor rates and some other indicators that could make us need to take more rate. I think the beautiful part is we got out ahead of rate that our hope is that the rate we take if we need to in some states will be less, will be the smaller bites of the apple that we like to take. We obviously couldn't do it in this environment because the trends were so dramatically increased, but we think there's a few states we're working on.

We think that the majority of the rate actions are behind us and what we're really thinking about now is when we can pull the trigger on some of that growth. And Pat and John and I sit down with the controller from personal lines very frequently, to talk about return to profit and return to growth in that order. And what we're looking at is literally state-by-state channel-by-channel in the auto book and saying, okay, if April results come out here, could we reduce underwriting restrictions? Could we open up a little bit of the local marketing? And I talked in my opening comments about how we have the ability to do so in each segment and each market because of the way we buy medias. It's a complicated question and there's 50 shades of this and actually 100 because of the channels and that we're working closely to figure out when to do that. But we feel confident and of course we have that seven points to earn in. So more will come to the story, but we're watching things closely.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Okay. And then my second question, as we've gone through this kind of this environment have you guys noticed any change or just snapshot and the take-off on your UBI products? And then has there been any change in discounts that you guys have offered or the time period on that you guys are observing with your products?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. We saw initially a pretty big increase in the take rate and the agency channel, which has been a challenge with us. So right now, we sit at about 40% take rate on the direct channel, about 10% in the agency channel and this of course is excluding California, North Carolina where we're not -- we can't use telematics. So that blended amount is about 28% take rate. We continue -- we have surcharges and discounts and of course participation discounts and we continue to learn from those and really try to make sure that ultimately we try to price to the whole curve and that's what we'll continue to do as our snapshot evolves.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks for the color.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thanks, Elyse.

Operator
Our next question comes from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Q - Michael Phillips{BIO 21023048 <GO>}
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Speaking of evolving snapshot, can you talk about, I guess, earlier lessons learned from, I guess, it's been about a month end since you've gone continuous in one state, kind of take away from there, maybe what we can expect for that to be a national plan for you guys? When that could be the case? And then just what does that mean you? If you do go national for that, what does it mean? Is it more accurate pricing therefore better loss ratios that are (inaudible), just kind of talk about what that means for you.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. It's literally been in one state Oklahoma for 30 days. We'll have to answer that question of how it's going maybe next quarter, the quarter after that. We like continuous because especially as we thought about the pandemic, it's more responsive in changed to driving behavior. And we think we can -- the costs have gone down over time on both mobile and the dongle. And so we thought it was a good time and we have high hopes that Oklahoma will be successful and that we'll continue to roll that out once we have more data.

Q - Michael Phillips{BIO 21023048 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks. Second, totally unrelated question. What percent of your new customers when they come in the door start off by going online and than end up switching from online to actually using a call center for you guys? And I'm wondering is there any year-term opportunities you can take advantage of given some (inaudible) competitor what they're doing in their call centers.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. I think it's a pretty small percentage. It used to be much larger, but I think our technology has gotten so much more sophisticated that more people finish to buy online when they're -- it's a small percentage.

Q - Michael Phillips{BIO 21023048 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you so much.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thanks Mike.

Our next question comes from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Gary, please go ahead.

Q - Gary Ransom{BIO 3446828 <GO>}
Thank you and good morning. I wanted to ask about claims counts and claims personal. And you've had a lot of growth on the commercial side, maybe it's a little bit flattered. But I wondered if you -- a little bit flatter on the personal line side, but I wondered if you could talk to us about having the right people as things are changing rapidly and if there's any difficulty in getting the staffing right there.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
That's a great question. And over the years, we really spent a lot of time making sure that we think about centralization and consolidation having the right file with the right representative at the right time and we took advantage of the slowdown when frequency plummeted during the beginning of the pandemic to do the same thing on the commercial line side because there is such a different analog. And what I would say is turnover is up especially with new hires and we're seeing that using across the industry and across with entry level jobs. That said, we've had this recruiting machine that is just amazing and it has enabled us to really continue to hire at a rate that helps us to get out in front of our growth. So we want to make sure that people are not just here, but they're trained and can do the right thing on behalf of our customers.

I think one of the things that I'm most proud of that we didn't do was to reduce our claims for us during the pandemic. We were severely overstaffed for several months and Mike Sieger who was the Claims President at the time and I made a decision that we just couldn't do it. We knew that this was for the country, not for our company and that allowed us to have staff waiting and available when things picked up. So we're going to continue to hire and advance of need on both the claims and CRM side, make sure we have the right training in both the virtual and maybe sometimes in office environment. We also look at and this group reports to John Sauerland. Our internal audit group looks at the quality of the files and we have seen continued good results in there -- in that.

Q - Gary Ransom{BIO 3446828 <GO>}
Can I also follow up just going to snapshot? I know you've talked on other times about using snapshots and snapshot on the claims process as well. Is -- have you --

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
You cut out, but I think what you're saying is are you using that in the claims process. That's something we'll definitely consider as we think about continuous. We'll think about other services and claims could be one where we could actually help with the investigation should our customers have that snapshot device.

Q - Gary Ransom{BIO 3446828 <GO>}
So that's still a future I think you're looking at.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Correct.

Q - Gary Ransom{BIO 3446828 <GO>}
Nothing really happening now.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. We're testing all the time. That's what I would say.

Q - Gary Ransom{BIO 3446828 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you very much.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thanks, Gary.

Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Josh, your line is open.

Q - Josh Shanker{BIO 21718992 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you. During your re-pricing and marketing rationalization, the policy count growth in Progressive property was still fairly healthy. I'm going to guess that you're not terribly interested in ensuring someone's home they're not also going to give you the cars. Can you talk a little bit about the different Robinsons retaining Sam versus retaining Robinsons and getting new ones over the past nine months.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. I'll take a stab at that. So Sams are -- have always been to find as shoppers and so they're very rate sensitive. And so we know that our retention is going to be less when we crank up rates in the auto side and that has proven to be true. And we've had less of retention fall in the Robinsons side. From the home perspective, we've been clear on our desire to de-risk and to get more of our non-volatile storm states more in the two-thirds of our book versus the 50% it is now. This quarter, we'll start to non-renew the policies that we talked about in Florida about 60,000 policies over the next year. And we continue to try to do de-risk our portfolio. With property, it takes a little bit of time because there are 12 month policies and it's also reflective of industry pricing. So I think you know you've seen the storms that have happened in March and now again in April. So a lot of it has to do with growth could be that. Right now, it's still a competitive market because everyone's increasing rate, but we're going to continue to increase rates and try to stay ahead of that trend and to de-risk our book a bit.

Q - Josh Shanker{BIO 21718992 <GO>}
And so net-net with Florida non-renewals, obviously, you are growing in 47 other states with barely desirest appetite. Should we feel that the infant deceleration in policy count growth overall property or do you think that those two things neutralize each other and it will be hard for us from our perspective to be able to see that going through the numbers?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, our - desire is to grow in the non-volatile state. So we're taking action to do so with more agents that are able to sell our property book. So it's hard to say and again that will be relative to what our competitors do. And in addition, I talked a little bit in my opening comments about our increased use of deeper segmentation in the property product. We believe we have industry-leading segmentation on the auto side. Our R&D departments work closely together to get that same level of segmentation in homes. I think that would be really important. And in many of the states that we still have a decent amount of policies and we've been able to have higher deductibles, have cost sharing. And so that -- so it's not treated as a maintenance policy that -- just wait for that hail storm to come and we'll replace your roof. And so those are some of the other things that we've changed. I can't really look out into the future and know how we're going to grow in the non-volatile states, but that is our approach and I think it'll take some time.

Q - Josh Shanker{BIO 21718992 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you very much.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}

Our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open.

Q - Greg Peters{BIO 3111497 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone. So in your answers, you mentioned eventually getting returning to growth and I wanted to focus on the advertising piece of that. Your advertising spend is down in the quarter, down year-over-year and I'm just wondering whether you actually need the lowest price to win the customer or put it another way, does the brand of Progressive get you to a customer win even if you don't have the lowest price? And when will the advertising spigot be turned back on if your -- most of your rate increases have been -- are behind you?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. I do think our brand would have us win in the marketplace and doesn't always have to be this lowest rate especially for people that have had experiences with us. I remember years ago when I ran claims, we were really high NPS for those people that had claims because of the way we treated them when they needed us most. So yes, I think that makes sense. And when we look at the difference between agency and direct as far as like a PLE, we see that direct has gone down and we think that has to do with the brand. So what Pat and I talk about is really state by state and we'll do some sensitivity analysis of if we turn on local marketing by X amount, X plus, X plus what we think could happen to new apps, et cetera. We will only do that if we're sure we're in the position to start that growth spigot. So we are as anxious as anyone. We do not like having new business app negative. We want to grow. We want to grow as fast as we can. But again, profit is one of our core values and that will trump growth. But let me tell you these conversations are happening every day. And when we turn it on, we will feel pretty confident that we're in a good position to do so. Of course, things can change and will always be. We have to be nimble with those changes and we'll be able to do that based on the data that we look at literally daily.

Q - Greg Peters{BIO 3111497 <GO>}
Got it. And my second question, I wanted to pivot. You talked about rolling out the new homeowners product. Can you just step back and tell us a little bit about that product and what differentiates it from what you were offering before?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. I'll let Pat take that.

A - Patrick Callahan{BIO 19087798 <GO>}
Yes. Happy to talk about that. So part of the segmentation that we need to enhance in the property side of the business is on the age of the home and the age of the roof primarily. And we've just got better segmentation that we're bringing in as we expand that product over time. There's also some coverage expansion that agents have asked for, but primarily it's understanding the risk better and recognizing that the majority of our losses are coming from damage to the roof on that home and capturing both the age of the roof and/or the age of the home or in most cases both helps us better rate and better underwrite.

Q - Greg Peters{BIO 3111497 <GO>}
And just as a follow-up to that answer, does that mean that the older the roof that your -- is there a different -- is there a depreciation schedule that you're applying allowing the customer to buy up for roof replacement? I'm just trying to understand how that fits with what some of your competitors are offering in the marketplace.

A - Patrick Callahan{BIO 19087798 <GO>}
Yes. It certainly varies by state what we can offer. And when we talk about a market like Florida that limits our ability to price a depreciated roof accurately that's one of the challenges that we see in a market like Florida, but we do offer a depreciation or a effectively a roof depreciation schedule for customers. So they're not, I guess, incentivized to have that roof replaced when it's old and there's damage to it.

Q - Greg Peters{BIO 3111497 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks for the answers.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}

Q - David Motemaden{BIO 18818634 <GO>}
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Tricia you've said you believe that the major auto rate increases are behind you and obviously looking to turn on the growth. I guess, just saying that the major auto rate increases are behind you, we still have seven points of rate that's going to earn in over the course of the rest of the '22. How should we think about the auto loss ratio and when that will start to stabilize and eventually improve? Do you think that's a second half of '22 of how are you thinking about that?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Well, we just follow the data. So we watch as the rates earn into the loss ratio and we have a couple big states where we were able to get rate pretty quickly in namely Texas and Florida and so those are two big states for us. And so we'll watch those states closely to see when we think it's the right time to grow. And again, we're watching all the macroeconomic factors that are going into the inflationary pressure specifically with collision and property damage to make sure those don't continue to increase I think of labor rates and items like that. So we'll watch those closely to make sure we have the right amount of rates to start the growth.

Q - David Motemaden{BIO 18818634 <GO>}
Got it. Thanks. And then, I guess, just thinking about maybe on that last point, just some of the severity factors and trends that you're observing throughout the course of the first quarter and then also your outlook. Could you maybe breakdown how you guys are thinking about used car prices as well as labor is one that you mentioned and the outlook on those items as we move forward from here?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. So we've watched the Manheim index pretty closely and even though there's a couple data points that say it's flattened or maybe even gone down, it's still 35% higher than January of 2021. So there hasn't been a step function change and a drop in used car prices. In addition, we know accidents are happening at a higher rate of speed. So there's more damage. We know that parts are up over 12%. Labor has only been up a couple percentage points. We're watching that closely just because of watching the unemployment environment and how tough it is to hire in the industry and text in the industry. And then because of body shop capacity, we're also seeing rental car extensions of several days. And so all those things kind of go into play when we think about severity on both collision and PB and that's why they're higher.

I feel pretty good and pretty stable on the BI side. In the last four quarters, it's been in the 6% to 8% range. We'll continue to watch that. We've seen a little bit of attorney rep rate increase in some of the general damages, which are the non-medical damages increase. but we feel that at least stabilizes over four quarters, but we'll watch that of course. But those are the big drivers that go into the extreme sort of severity trends in collision and PD.

Q - David Motemaden{BIO 18818634 <GO>}
Got it. And as a follow-up, when you say that you're ready to move potentially to more growth and your rates -- you feel like most of them are behind you, what is the severity of you that you're baking into that statement?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
The severity view, I think we're just looking to see if we can -- the severity will be what it will be in terms of what's happening from an inflationary perspective. So we're just pricing to that. And when we believe we can make our calendar year and lifetime target mark, the profit margins will start to grow.

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
It's important to recognize a lot of these decisions are made locally. So we have product managers who are responsible for geography and products and they are obviously adjusting rates with their view and the pricing team's view of future loss trends. They take the rates up and while they're fairly confident that the projections are right, normally you're going to want to see some results come in before you open up the spigots on the new business side. That said, there are geographies now where we have done that, but there are also a lot of geographies where we have either not gotten the rate we need such as some of the large states we mentioned earlier or we're still a bit tentative on understanding if we have taken enough rate such that we can open up the spigots.

So it really is a day-to-day PM state geography level decision on when to turn advertising back on, when to loosen the underwriting. But again, I think one of the strengths we have is that team of product managers who are considering everything locally and making the best call again on a day-to-day basis. So it's not something we can predict at the sort of aggregate level. It's going to come down to state level decisions and we're confident we're going to be making right ones in each state at the right time.

Q - David Motemaden{BIO 18818634 <GO>}
Understood. Thank you so much for the color.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}

Our next question comes from the Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Q - Yaron Kinar{BIO 17146197 <GO>}
Thank you and good morning. I was just curious with the situation in the Eastern Europe and Russia. Seems like some of the European OEMs have had some last supply chain issues. Are you seeing that impact any of the U.S. manufacturers or prices -- cars, used cars parts and so on?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Not really. We see the same sort of bottlenecks in supply chain with chips that happened before what's happening in Russia and the Ukraine and followed. There's still some supply issues there especially with new cars and that has of course increased used car prices, but that was prior to this.

Q - Yaron Kinar{BIO 17146197 <GO>}
Okay. And then I think one of the comments you made around homeowners is that your ability to grow is going to depend on competitive -- the competitive environment. Can you maybe talk about how you see the competitive environment in homeowners outside of the southeast in Florida?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
That's also sort of state by state as well, because if you go out west, there's issues in terms of fires, et cetera. So I think we look at each stage, look at the proclivity to have major weather events understand our segmentation more deeply and then we look around the competition on both the direct and agency side. So we've got the -- not just the agency side where we sell Progressive home against some of the captives or bigger players, but we also have the direct side where we have the opportunity to have Progressive home as well as many unaffiliated partners. And so we have some advantage to get Robinsons that are not always on our paper as well. But we look at -- we look across the country, try to get -- we try to get to the more non-volatile states. We believe when we look at our results against the industry and non-weather in those states, we are very competitive.

And we have a great and broad distribution network in those non-volatile states that are quite committed to Progressive as a company. They use in their offices. So our independent agents across those non-volatile states ensure a lot of Robinsons. So we have access to a lot of that business and we're going to spend more time going after it. And I know you sort of excluded Florida and the southeast states in the question, but it's really important that there are solutions in those states that are viable for consumers and the industry.

And it has been very challenging in some of those environments and so we're working with regulators and legislators to find solutions because Florida specifically right now is a very disrupted market. Pat was talking about the reliability of depreciating a roof in Florida. You must offer full replacement value on your route from Florida. So it's very difficult to find solutions for homes that have older roofs that are not up to code. So we hope to obviously grow in the non-volatile states. We also hope for solutions in some of those cap prone states that are again amenable to both consumers and the industry.

Our next question is from the line of Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Tracy your line is open.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
Good morning. Before declaring victory on rate adequacy with the exception of you keep these, I'm wondering if you're seeing favorable seasonality in the first quarter like others are talking about. And if so have you taken that into account when you say the majority of your rate increases are behind you?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I think our seasonality has been relatively stable as it has been in the past. I'm not saying we're winning, Tracy. What we're saying is that we believe we have -- we got out in front of our competitors with rate from the data that we look at. We're watching trends very closely, a lot of caveats to that. All we're saying is that with the rate we have from last year and the rate that we have on the street, we believe we're well positioned, again lots of caveats on making sure that we have enough and that we can grow and turn on that local media. So I'll -- and then maybe in a quarter or two, we can have a different conversation hopefully. But right now, we're still tentative, but we wanted to just give some color on the fact that we're really proud of our rate making machine that we were able to get out in front of that despite a lot of headwinds.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
I hear optimism, but I'm also just wondering in some states are you just don't believe reaching your maximum limit? Do you think regulators will allow you to take or in theory if you're choosing to take more rate you could do so?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
We look at the data and we look at perspective rates in terms of what we're seeing in trends. And if we need more even in states where we have already increased rates several times, we will share the actuarial data to get the right rate to get to our profit target margin and that's how we've always worked. And I think regulators are thinking about their constituents because of all the other inflationary pressures, but this industry it's been very clear. Needs rate has needed rate for some time since last year and now we feel good that we're starting to get it in many of our larger states. So I'm just optimistic because we were able to have great conversations, great relationships in a couple key states and many states across the board with key regulators where they get it. They see the data. They understand it and they know the worst thing you can do is not give the rate because then you're not going to have insurance available for their constituents. And ultimately, you're going to have to get the rate. So it's going to be over time, there will be bigger rates in the future. So I think that's how it works and so I am very optimistic.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
Okay. And I know you make local decisions, but to any extent are you taking any cross state subsidies like higher rates in states where you have success to make up for rate inadequacies in states like California?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
No. We have a very specific goal of not subsidizing and to have every one of our products in the aggregate coming to our 96 combined ratio goal.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
Okay. And sorry, just real quick. You mentioned the 20% takeoff in telematics. Is that for new business only? If not, what percentage of your in force uses telematics?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
The 28% is in force -- no, new, I'm sorry, new. It's 40% new and direct. 10% new and agency, yes.

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
And we don't report the mix from (inaudible) --

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
Sorry, if that's the new. What would it be for your in force which is a lot larger than your new business?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I think we are saying that we don't share that.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
You don't share that. Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.

Next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian, your line is open.

Q - Brian Meredith{BIO 3108204 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks. John, first one for you. Just curious where do new money yields stand right now as of today versus your kind of book yield on your fixed income portfolio. And maybe perhaps you can give us just a general sense of how much your portfolio rolls every 12 months.

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Thanks. I'll take that one. So don't like to give too specifics, but I would think in broad swath if you look at March 2022 in terms of where investments were inclusive of treasuries, it was about 2.5% and taking that out on either side of 3%. Generally, as you think about a portfolio with a three year duration and our size, I would think about every 12 months anywhere from sort of $6 billion to $8 billion of that portfolio rolling up.

Q - Brian Meredith{BIO 3108204 <GO>}
Great really helpful. And then second question. I'm just curious, Tracy, would you would you care to speculate or tell us -- give us some sense of when you think California will actually start granting rate increases?

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
Brian, if I knew the answer to that, we're -- all I can say is we're working, yes, we're working with the regulators and doing all that we can because we want to be able to open up and we want to be able to have affordable available insurance for Californians. It's the most populous state. We'd love to grow there and we'll do what we can to do so.

Q - Brian Meredith{BIO 3108204 <GO>}
Great. I mean, is there -- I mean, just curious is there a matter of time that you're willing to wait to get those rate increases. Are you taking some pretty significant non-underwriting actions here to improve results right now?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. We're taking very significant non-rate actions because of the inability to get the rate. And obviously, we will work -- we'll work with the regulators to figure out the best thing to do for our mutual constituents and we just need to continue to do so.

Q - Brian Meredith{BIO 3108204 <GO>}
Great. Can I ask just one more quick? I'm just curious do you at least continue to kind of drop pretty significantly. Is that reflected of kind of a change in business mix or is that just the pricing environment? And just maybe remind us exactly kind of what that PLA reflects?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
It really does reflects the pricing environment and I talked a little bit about the difference in agency and direct with agency being a little bit more elastic. And when we look at PLEs ex Texas and Florida, they obviously don't drop as dramatically, which would tell you it's pricing, because we got out in those two big states pretty early. I think that that our holy grail is retention, but we also have to be priced right. And we also know that some consumers are trying to figure out can they change their coverages or do things differently or add snapshot and things like that to reduce their prices. So I know in our CRM organization, we continue to try to grow what we call our customer preservation team. So they call in and their challenge to pay their bill because of increases, can we work with them on bill plans on coverage to make sure they're obviously still covered, but to get them the right rate in order for them to stay, but it is reflective of the majority of with prices.

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
And just to reiterate a couple points made earlier in response to that question, we do see different elasticity by our consumer segments, so on the more preferred end, less elastic and the more non-standard or Sam and/or elastic. So that obviously plays itself through into the PLE change. Additionally, as Trisha noted earlier, we do see a difference by channel. So some of that's because our agents have access to other markets and might proactively shop, but we also think there's some brand benefits. So we do see less degradation in the direct channel than we do in the agency channel.

Q - Brian Meredith{BIO 3108204 <GO>}
Very helpful. Thank you.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}

Our next question is from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Alex, please go ahead with your question.

Q - Alex Scott{BIO 20003952 <GO>}
Thanks. First one I had is just on the personal auto NPW growth. I think high level when we try to triangulate the pit [ph] growth that you're getting in the rate, the NPW growth isn't sort of showing as much of the rate flowing through as I would have expected and just interested if there's any kind of mix shift or something affecting that or if there's any nuances to that that I should be considering.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. I would probably point to average written premium grows with the pricing increases coming in. And I think that's reflective of our new business growth and overall growth.

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Couple other comments on that. So we did mention we still have seven points of rate to earn in in our personal auto program. So some of the rate we've taken has not yet affected the policies. We report the written premium change. So the earnings will affect combined ratio more so down the road. But if you look at the change in new average written premium versus renewal, you'll see renewal is up significantly more. So as we take revisions that are predominately based for revisions, those will flow through directly to all our renewal customers. On the new business side, people shop. So we won't see all that average written premium benefit for new customers perhaps at any time when we are taking rates up. So there's some timing issues there, but we're also cognizant of the new renewal mix and how that flows through in terms of the total average premiums. So we think the rate we're taking is definitely earning into the book is being accepted by consumers actually at a little higher rate than we've seen historically, which is also reflective we think of the market conditions. So we think the actions we're taking are absolutely resulting in the outcomes we're expecting.

Q - Alex Scott{BIO 20003952 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you. And second one I had is just on competition. You talked about some of the advantages you have in your sophistication with the ad spend and I'm just interested if you've seen anything as we've kind of gone through the pandemic, which I think was a bit of a wake up call it to some of the more brick and mortar type distribution companies. Are you seeing more competition there or you're able to execute that strategy to the same degree you've been able to in the past even just thinking beyond like where pricing is at the moment and relative to peers near-term?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. And I would direct you back to our four strategic pillars that we talk about all the time and make sure that we invest in all the time and I have seen our strength there. So the first one is our people and our culture are most important competitive advantage. So during the pandemic, we have really made sure that we are connecting even if it's virtual to our employees continue to do every new hire class. I am on about virtually and now more in-person, but people and culture are really important. And it is important for people to feel good about being on a winning team. So second we've talked about a lot is our brand. So we're going to continue to invest in our brand and have some really great creative coming out end of this month or early June. And then of course competitive prices that's -- we've been talking about that for the last hour. We want to get to, where we are really competitive. So part of that is getting the right rates, but it's also that continuation of our superior segmentation and making sure that we care deeply about expenses. So we continue to create expense goals for the future.

And then lastly and John have brought this up is our broad coverage. So we're going to continue to be where, when and how customers want to shop and I think that's the key. So regardless of the people enter the independent agent channel or the directional, we've been in both for a long time. We appreciate both. We appreciate the fact that consumers have a choice of if they want to buy on their phone, their iPad, through an agent, through 1800 Progressive and we're going to be there as they change especially as we've invested more in business quote explore on the commercial side, home quote explore. So all those four strategic pillars really work hand in glove to make sure that we stay competitive. So I feel really great about our position in both channels and how we think about the future.

Q - Alex Scott{BIO 20003952 <GO>}

Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.

Q - Meyer Shields{BIO 4281064 <GO>}
Great. Thanks so much. Tricia, in response to an earlier question you talked about the return to profit preceding the return to growth in conversations with controller. Is that true on a monthly basis or is that a full year? In other words, if your priced adequately, but haven't earned it in all the rate increases that are in the market now, will that constrain grow?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. We'll look at timing of when to start, when to ramp-up some local advertising. Remember, we haven't showed off our national advertising. So it's not like our brand isn't out there. So we still have some ability to grow. But yes, we'll look at the kind of pivotal time, right time of when we should start that growth making sure that the rates in each particular state are adequate for us to reach our target profit margins.

Q - Meyer Shields{BIO 4281064 <GO>}
Okay. So there's some monthly combined ratio pressure because lower rate that's not an impediment to growth.

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
No. We are obviously managing to our calendar year '96 or better. So we have that as an objective function for sure as to the product managers. But if they've taken rates up to where they think the lifetime combined ratio for new customers their writing is adequate, they will likely air towards growing more. There is the consideration of the calendar year combined ratio for sure as well. But generally, if they think the new business customers their writing today are adequately priced over their lifetime, they will be happy to go for growth.

Q - Meyer Shields{BIO 4281064 <GO>}
Okay. Perfect. Thanks. I apologize for not expressing the question well. Second question on price sensitivity. Is that heightened across areas customer segments when overall inflation outside of car insurance is elevated?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. I'm not really sure if we know that. But I think what John was saying to in terms of elasticity, our renewals are improving on the elasticity side, which tells us that and we do sort of histogram on decreases or increases as to a certain percentage. We use buckets of percentages and we're seeing more people. Even if they're shopping, they're staying when they get their renewal which likely means they can't find a better rate. So that's the only thing we can look at within data, but it's hard to say with all the economic things going on in the country.

Q - Meyer Shields{BIO 4281064 <GO>}
Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}

Our next question is Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Ryan, please go ahead.

Q - Ryan Tunis{BIO 16502263 <GO>}
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I just had a question on, I guess, operating within Progressive's constraints. So the plan historically has always been doing 96 or better and grow as fast as you can and the vast majority of the time growth is easy because you're usually close to the 96. But whatever you've gotten kind of close to the 96 like the second half of last year, it's been focused on re-underwriting, focused less on growth, all that. I guess, I'm just curious and you did that before you even had a 96 to avoid getting there. So after having gone through the first quarter when you did and again somewhere around a 94 on a group basis and above a 96 and personal auto. Is it safe to say that sort of you have the same risk appetite that you did later in '20 -- later last year?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, I think our standard and our operating philosophy hasn't changed. And remember if we're reporting a 94.5, we're still looking at perspective rates and we're looking at trends that will be future over 96 as if we don't do something. So the data is in a moment in time. We're looking at rate need ahead of time to make sure that we put that good business on the books for both the calendar year 96 and a lifetime 96. I think those constraints as you call them, I mean, I think I'd call them just our operating philosophy have worked well over the years. In fact, the first time we talked about 96 was in our annual report in 1971 when we went public and it's worked really well for us.

If you look at our long-term trend, it's nice to have that governor. It helps keep us disciplined around our pricing. It helps keep us disciplined around our expense philosophy and it has built us to the number three personal auto carrier. And I can tell you when I started in 1988, we were nowhere there. So we will continue with that and of course 96 is in the aggregate. So it doesn't mean that obviously our -- new business on the direct side wouldn't come in at 96 and there's other areas where we aggregate up to the 96 and I think it's been a great winning business model.

Q - Ryan Tunis{BIO 16502263 <GO>}
Got it. That's clear. And then my follow-up was just on retention. So retention has continued to actually hold up a lot better than I would have expected and just seeing how much weight you implemented in the first quarter. Yes, I was just maybe wanting some clarity on of what you've implemented how much is actually been showing to the customer. Was that mainly a first quarter? And I'm just kind of trying to think of like maybe that might be somewhat of a tailwind in the second quarter.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Well, I think if you -- it depends on if you're looking at the trailing 3 or trailing 12. I think trailing 3 is more responsive to our rate increases. And so I started to say before we saw early results with our intention in some of the states where we took increases more quickly. We could still see a little bit of degradation. Again, a lot of that is relative to what our competition is doing. So if you're getting your renewal and you're shopping and rates are going up and again that's why we try to get ahead of rate because if we can be stable, which is what consumers want and they go to shop and now it's much more increased in with our competitors, they're going to stay with us and then of course the new we've been talking about for a while. So we keep a close eye on retention especially because we've been really proud of the work we've done to-date over the many, many years. But we'll watch that closely and do everything in our power to keep our customers that we've taken so much to acquire.
