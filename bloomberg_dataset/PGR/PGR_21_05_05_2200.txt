Presentation
Operator
Welcome to the Progressive Corporation's First Quarter Investor Event. The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website, although CEO Tricia Griffith will make a brief statement.

The company will then use the remainder of the event to respond to questions. Acting as moderator for the event will be Progressive Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine. At this time, I'll turn the event over to Mr. Constantine.

Doug Constantine{BIO 22182643 <GO>}
Thank you, [ph]De Tamara and good morning. Although our quarterly investor relations events typically includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. The dial-in instructions can may be found at investors.progressive.com/events.

As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as supplemented by our 10-Q report for the first quarter of 2021. We will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business. Safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face.

Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith will make some introductory comments. Tricia.

Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thanks, Doug. Good morning and welcome to Progressive's first quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. During our fourth quarter call, we took the opportunity to reflect on 2020 and the emotional toll the pandemic and social unrest. Now with the first quarter of 2021 behind us, we look forward with the optimism that the vaccine rollout spring and the hope of a return to normalcy.

Our people are showing tremendous resilience in the face of hardships and a willingness to react to whatever comes next for the positive attitude, which allow us to continue to deliver fantastic results. This quarter our net premiums written growth was 19% and we report a healthy combined ratio of $89.3 million. All lines were profitable with the exception of property where catastrophic weather losses added 30.6 points to the combined ratio.

Policies in force growth continues to be strong at 12%. And I'm most excited to report that we passed the milestones of 17 million personal auto PIF, 5 million special line PIF, and 25 million company-wide PIFs during the first quarter.

I also want to point out that this is the first time since the second quarter of 2004, that we reported double-digit growth in personal auto, special lines, and commercial lines policies in force. We couldn't be prouder there's so many people trust Progressive to protect some of their most important assets.

I'd like to take some time to address the effect the pandemic will have on our year-over-year comparative results for the next several months. March was the first month where we saw the effect of the pandemic in our previous year's results. So it feels like a good time to give some further insight into our March 2021 results and remind everyone of the actions that we took in 2020 that could affect our year-over-year comparison.

This quarter we reported 14% new app growth in personal lines and 29% new app growth in Commercial lines. The year-over-year growth reflects two items. The effect of the stimulus package and the denominator that includes the onset of the pandemic in which shopping virtually stopped. Even considering the effects of the pandemic growth is robust. We've often said that PIF growth is our preferred measure of growth. This is a great example why since the denominator was only nominally affected by the pandemic.

Last year's new business metrics continue to be affected by the pandemic well into the summer of 2020, so not always negatively. In mid-April 2020, the first wave of stimulus checks were released which restarted new business shopping. We expect the uptick in shopping last year will affect our second quarter 2021 year-over-year new business growth.

Also starting in April of last year, we took actions to support our customers, including our Apron Relief Program, which we believe will have an impact on many key metrics including our expense ratio.

At the end of April and May of 2020, our personal auto customers received monthly premium credits of 20%, which provided substantial financial assistance to our customers but also increased our expense ratio.

In addition, as part of the Apron Relief Program, we initiated payment and billing leniency, which temporarily increased our bad debt expense, but also increased our positive retention. Both policy enforce counts and retention metrics were effected by billing leniency.

In commercial lines, our TNC business saw a sudden and dramatic decrease in miles driven and estimated future miles to be driven in March of 2020, which contributed to the significant commercial lines net premiums written increase in March of 2021 as noted in our March release. Miles driven in those premiums slowly recovered over the course of 2020, so we anticipate the effect on the denominator will decrease over the remainder of 2021.

Our property results continue to be rocked by catastrophic losses. In the first quarter, which is normally a relatively quiet quarter for cat losses, property business suffered significant losses. Further the hailstorms in Texas and Oklahoma that occurred in late April appeared to be another large event.

While it's too early to assess our ultimate exposure, I'll take this opportunity to remind everyone that we have an $80 million retention threshold from a single storm under our occurrence excess of loss reinsurance program. We'll have more details on the late April events in our April release, which is currently scheduled for May 19th.

I'd also like to take a moment to thank everyone who participated in the perception study we commissioned at the beginning of the year. It was encouraging to see all the positive comments we received and it helpful to receive feedback on ways we can improve. One opportunity we heard loud and clear was a desire to return to the quarterly call format we had before the pandemic. One in which senior managers from around the organization were present on various aspects of the business. We intend to return to this format during at least two of the calls each year starting with the obvious call, where we will highlight commercial lines.

Looking forward into the rest of 2021, I'm filled with a sense of optimism. While the pandemic is far from over and we still have many challenges ahead of us. I think pride in the strength of our business, the resilience of our people and have confidence that the plans we have in place will likely continue to deliver great results in the coming quarters. Thank you.

And I'm ready to take the first question, [ph]De Tammara.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Your first response is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the frequency disclosure in the 10-Q. The frequency was down for all coverages except collision in the first quarter. I was just interested in knowing why by stating more color on what was going on?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes, we are actually assessing that right now. When we look at the gap in PD inclusion at least one other competitor had similar results. We believe in part. It is due to our CWP rates being different PD inclusion. So, right now at least for having Gary Traicoff Group and our Claims Control Group dig in a little bit deeper, the reporting is similar CWP rate is different, so we're trying to discern exactly what that is.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of direct, you saw some pretty strong new at growth on there and you also saw strong renewal growth as well. So I guess my question is the new business, I don't see significant and is it being masked by the increase that you're also seeing within your renewal business as well.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I think whenever we get acquire new business, we're obviously going to spend more for it. In terms of both advertising which you saw increased 25% on the direct side in commission. So I don't know that penalty is extraordinary journey, you can weigh in a little bit on that. The renewal, one we're proud of our service and our rates so we know that some of the retention gains are likely due to what has happened during the pandemic in terms of non-cancellation et cetera, but I wouldn't say that there is a big penalty.

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
I would agree. The new business growth is certainly a function of denominator. We all recognize that, but it's also a function of 25% more advertising spend and we always like to reiterate that we are only spending when we believe it to be efficient, but in terms of a penalty the mix in terms of policies and premium new to renewal is fairly stable even when you're growing new business a lot. The business as mature as our businesses are.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
And then just one quick follow-up on my first question. When you said CWP. I just want to make sure that is that claims with payments when you were discussing on the collusion question, I had dark?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I'm sorry about that. At least we have a lot of acronyms here it's claims without payment. So claims that come in and then we close them, because we no longer seen exposure.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you.

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
I was just to clarify the trend for close without payments for collision has been going down. It's actually predates the pandemic and for property damage it's been going up. So that obviously affects the total frequency. So our next question.

Operator
Your next response is from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Q - Greg Peters{BIO 3111497 <GO>}
Good morning. My first question will be on commission rates. I know some of your competitors have lightened up on the commissions they pay their agents this is happened in the auto business, but we're also in the property business, a lot of the regional carriers have been slammed with high combined ratios and underwriting losses and we're also hearing them apply pressure on commission rates. Can you talk to us about your view on commission rates? Give us synopsis of the history. And then what do you think it's going to happen in '21?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I mean the history of our commission rates we try to look at an aggregate right around 10% and 10.5%. And then it's different depending on the type of customer that comes in, if things are bundled, we obviously have several thousand platinum agents to get a higher commission because they are bundling the auto and home those Robinsons customers. And so, if you bring in a group of customers that we believe are going to be their short-term, the commission might be less. Again the aggregate is we try to keep around 10% and 10.5%, and we also do have some preferred programs and bonuses for agents depending on their loss performance. It's not across the board it's with specific agents. Do you want to add anything? John?

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Yes, the 10.5%, the Tricia citing is generally where we run in our auto business. On the property side, we have a higher commission rates, but the overarching objective here is to ensure we have competitive prices that means we have that competitive commissions as well as competitive other cost what we call non-acquisition expense ratio or cost. And so really it's the combination of go-to-market in terms of having a competitive aggregate expense ratio, both those come into play and obviously a commission at which we think our agents will thrive.

So there has been downward movement from competitors. You're right. I think we have seen some positives to that to some degree, because our commissions are more or like competitors these days than perhaps they were previously, but we couldn't really tease out any specific impact of that, that's where it get going.

Q - Greg Peters{BIO 3111497 <GO>}
Thank you for that answer. My next question will focus on the property business, because it does stand out for its underwriting result which is very on Progressive like. I'm wondering if the view on the Property business at this point in time is more of a loss leader to drive retention in the Robinsons, and so you're willing to sacrifice your margins in order to drive up retention. Or alternatively do you also have this overarching objective to eventually get that business down to. I think your corporate target is 96% combined ratio maybe it's lower because this property, but some color there would be helpful.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. No we do not want to be a loss leader. We -- profit is one of our core values. We have a very specific target margin for our property business that as you stated rolls up to our 96%. We've just been riddled with a lot of catastrophes. It's also a fairly newer business in term for us in terms of segmentation. So if you look at over the years, how much we've improved and continued to improved at a really quick rate our segmentation in auto. We anticipate, we'll do that in home. So we have a new product models.

We have our R&D group working on the right product models, which could be in our Europe roof and we've also have some restrictions for customers and the hail prone states to have them by relatively higher deductibles for wins in hell, because we've seen that that really causes a lot. In addition, we have done a lot of rate increases. So in 2020, we took about 11.5 points. Another close to 1.5 points in Q1 and we have another 4.2 points expected in quarter two. So we continue to raise rates to ultimately get to that goal. Now, what we're happy with and I wrote in my letter is the fact that we are getting a high percentage of bundled customer on both the direct and agency side.

And what we know on the agency side is without having a property product. We would not have gotten a likely have not gotten most of those autos. So we want those, but we want to make our target margins across the board period. So that's what we're working towards. We really have -- along with the industry been rocks with catastrophes and of course we also have heavily re-insurance on the property side to protect the downside, but nowhere we're not thrilled with those results. And we're going to continue to chip away to get to our ultimate goal.

Q - Greg Peters{BIO 3111497 <GO>}
Thank you for the answer.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thank you, Greg.

Operator
Thank you. Your next response is from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Phillips{BIO 22084844 <GO>}
Thanks. Thank you. Good morning everybody. First question on Telematics and outside of pricing. We've seen some competitors talk about increasing Telematics and claims. And I guess I'm curious, if you could talk about any -- can you just give me any value that you're currently getting from snapshot in claims. And then related, is there any opportunities maybe outside of pricing segmentation for Snapshot. So I guess to extend the period of time that you collect data from Snapshot to help in other areas besides pricing segmentation.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thanks, Michael. We've been looking into claims and Snapshot understanding the facts of loss, fraud, other things for quite some time. I think we have about 150,000 customers that are currently -- that we currently have access to claims information should they have a loss, and we'll have more to come on that. We've been working on that for a while, but we think it is an important next step for these in our Telematics.

And we've talked onto about, do we have continuous monitoring, would that help not only with understanding the likelihood of changing driving behavior, but also could help with other necessary things the customers have grown accustomed to in terms of added services like tows and gas stations and things like that. So that is on our list as well.

Currently, obviously during the pandemic, our big effort was to try to understand vehicle miles driven and how that relates to work from home versus not work from home et cetera, as well as some of the other items we've talked about the Apron Relief. I've talked about in terms of actually shorter monitoring period to give people who believe that they're driving last the ability to improve that through data and give them a lesser rate, but we've been on the UBI bandwagon for a couple of decades, will continue to do so. We do so on both the personal auto and the commercial auto side, really happy with our Smart Haul results, very successful and the program is very profitable on the commercial auto side, because that's a big expense for truckers. But I mean all those things are on our agenda. And we continue to invest a lot of this area.

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
The other thing, I don't know if we call it Telematics earn out that is evolving is dashcam video. So, especially in the commercial space. Those devices are frequently one in the same and with the higher limits in the commercial space, if you a video it can be extremely helpful in resolving claims, because some of those vehicles are targeted because of the limits, and if you have video that clearly shows it was stage, it resolves the claims very quickly. So Telematics is certainly a benefit the profitability, and at rating side as Tricia mentioned evolving for claims from personal and evolving for commercial as well including dashcam video.

Q - Michael Phillips{BIO 22084844 <GO>}
Okay, great. Thank you guys. Second question, you got this included with this weekend from the friends in Omaha on your lead you have in Telematics and risk-based pricing. But I guess if we look at and they said they're going to start to do more. So I would think that gap could narrow possibly if we combine that with, if we look at some states where the use of credit score and use of Telematics has been limited, if not all about bands and these are small states math New York as an example. There the lead from that competitor is pretty significant overview in terms of share gains.

So I guess if we combine those two things in credit score may starts to fade away in other states and then their use of Telematics may start to pick up. How do you think about that competitive dynamic between you and them in states as the overall market shifts away from credit and they start to shift more towards Telematics?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes, Great question. I'll just, I'll use key [ph]word, so yes GEICO did, Berkshire talked a lot about it. There are formidable competitor and we like the competition, because it makes us better and it's better for customers. Here's how we think about segmentation. We have -- we've had an edge on a lot of our competitors for many, many years now and we're not going to stop. And we believe rates at risk has a lot to do with many different variables, insurance credit scores being one of them. Usage based insurance being one of them, but there are a lot of other variables. We will comply with the regulators. We believe they help to match rate to risk in their correlated to ultimate losses, which is really important for all consumers to keep their rates competitive.

And so, I'm not surprised that they're going to spend more money on that. We are also will be spending more money on continuation of our many, many billion miles of Snapshot data on both the auto side and the commercial auto side. So we like the competition. We think it's great and now, 10-years ago I might have said this, but now we have head-to-head brands. So you may like or you may not, but you know who flow is and we're very proud of flow, the network and all the different characters. So I think going head-to-head and all those things is a good thing I've always been competitive and we like that. I think it makes us better and it makes sure that you don't just rest on your moral. So we will react to whatever we need to react and continue to invest in segmentation, especially and usage based insurance, but other segmentation variables as well as our brand, our broad coverage and people on culture at Progressive and we think all those together are really winning formula.

Q - Michael Phillips{BIO 22084844 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you, Tricia. I appreciate it.

Operator
Thank you. Your next response is from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.

Q - David Motemaden{BIO 18818634 <GO>}
Hi, good morning. I had a question, Tricia in your letter you spoke about Robinson PIF growth up 20% in the direct channel and up 16% in the agency channel. I guess I'm wondering if you could just sort of level set us here and just think about what percent of the book now is bundled customers and also maybe just talk a bit about margin differential and policy life expectancy differential where that stands today?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes. So we're very happy about the increase in Robinson, and that's really what our goal has been to have those bundled customers. We've added some platinum agents on the agency side. I would say, our total book of Robinsons right now is right around 10% which is much higher than it was many years ago. So we continue to kind of gain that momentum in Robinsons and what is the other part of your question?

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Profitability.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Profitability. Yes, they are preferred customers. So we believe there are more profitable. And on the retention side, the retention is dramatically different. Not just on the Robinsons side, but as you have more and more policies with us. So that's why it's so important for us to continue to give people a reason to stay for decades and decades to be able to have products that cannot come from the same care, whether or not we write it on our paper or not so. Yes, so that's the preferred customer and we want wider margins there and the retention is longer.

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Our target. Just for clarification, across the customer segments for auto is pretty on a lifetime basis is consistent. So obviously the loss costs vary at times and frankly during the pandemic, more preferred customers who have the ability to work from home have been driving less than other customers whose professions require them to drive to the office. So while we might have different margins by segment in the near-term due to extenuating circumstances. Our target margin across those customer segments is consistent (inaudible).

Q - David Motemaden{BIO 18818634 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just switching gears a little bit just over to the severity side of the equation, we're just thinking about loss cost. It didn't look like you saw a big increase in severity this quarter, property damage severity was flattish collision up a little bit, but you obviously hearing a lot about supply shortages, chip shortages. Just wondering how you're thinking about severity as we go forward combined with the mix of maybe claims coming back a little bit. So the mix of claims might be somewhat of a tailwind for severity, where you have a bit more fender benders and that could potentially bring it down. But sort of just maybe at a high level just want to get your take in terms of where you expect severity to go just given everything that we're seeing in the macro-environment right now.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I wish I knew the answer to that question, that is such as top-line. We are seeing some losses come back, especially now and it makes sense on the special line side, we'll watch that closely. We haven't been affected yet from the semiconductor shortage. We watch those things, closely and some other severity, we'll look at in terms of our average premium is down a little bit. And we've had a lot of cat losses. So all those things play into it.

And then of course, it really does like you said it plays into it in terms of what do people do as different states open. So will there be more highway travel, because you pack them to kids, grandma and grandpa on that cause less volatile accidents, we've been seeing obviously the congestion is less in the pandemic then it will be. So we're watching all of those things closely, and we're going to be able to react to those and we've never been in this situation. So we were watch closely with not just our EBIT data, but some other data that we're starting to gleam in terms of understanding when more people are starting to work from the office and so we have some occupations in some data shows some people are already there. Some people are there a little bit more often, and we're going to continue to watch that because we think that that could creep up pretty quickly and we want to be on top of that.

Q - David Motemaden{BIO 18818634 <GO>}
Thank you. That makes sense. And maybe just following-up on that point. Was any of that just sort of I guess caution and uncertainty, did that come through. Because it looks like you guys after decreasing rates last year, it looks like you increased rates in auto obviously not a little bit by a little bit 100%, but did that have any influence on that rate change?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
When we look at all the trends in terms of what we do. So we went after we took credits, then we looked across the board and we look at state-by-state, product-by-product, channel-by-channel. And our goal is always to take small bites of the apple, because our customers we know they want rate stability and so we felt great at the end of this year.

And now we're doing the same thing. We're taking a look and different states have very different attributes in terms of increases in frequency and severity and driving behavior. So that less than 1% is just based on us. Looking to the data and making tweaks and we'll do that the rest of this year as we see things unfold. So it's really using the data and then saying okay, we need a little bit more on is product in the state in this channel. And that's why I think the way we're set up is so good, because we're a machine that can react pretty quickly to those trends as they unfold.

Q - Michael Phillips{BIO 22084844 <GO>}

Your next response is from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Q - Josh Shanker{BIO 5292022 <GO>}
Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a clarification please on the [ph]March 17 Shopping Day, the biggest shopping day you've seen when people got their stimulus check. Are these stands with discontinuous coverage who've come back into the insured population along those lines, I mean. Yes, I know you are certainly rate that business, but it obviously doesn't have a lot of persistency. I'm just trying to understand the surge related to the stimulus and what that means for April and May.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thanks Josh. And actually for years, if you go back, we presented this in a IR meeting probably maybe seven or eight years ago. We saw that shopping when people get their earn income tax stimulus from the government and it is largely Sam's. It is other people that I think other concessions that have lost their insurance or couldn't afford to it, but in the large part Sam's and our theory on Sam's we grew up with them. We love them as long as we can make our target margins.

So the stimulus just exacerbated that. These are people that are trying to do the right thing and maybe loss coverage and want to get back in the game and be legal and do the right things. So we see this and other stimulus that started and will continue to be something where will increase shopping behavior for the industry as a whole. But yes, a large part of it is predominantly Sam's.

Q - Josh Shanker{BIO 5292022 <GO>}
Okay. And then just following on David's severity question. We've obviously heard a lot about lumber prices going up. And we've heard about rental car issues and whatnot. Those issues are seems very, very close to what might be a severity inflation related issue for Progressive. In your current pricing are the inflation issues that are sort of kitchen table issues that everybody knows about it that captured in how you're pricing right now or is that going to contribute to future rate?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
We look at all the macroeconomics that are going on and react to that on severity basis. I would say on the rental coverage, especially for our first party, we have contracts in place to minimize the amount that you pay per day on a rental. So if we feel good about that. We also believe on the rental side that if you get out there and see the car customers want their car back in their driveway.

So we really do try to compress the time with which to get the car back into at or better shape than before the accident. So we've always pride ourselves on the actual time that that takes, which of course the fixed rental. On Lumber, we will start to see that unfold and if we believe that it is a piece of the severity, we will price that in future rate increases.

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Yes Josh, as you know, insurance is an interesting product, because you truly don't know the cost of goods sold until a year from now, in case of home. But in rate indications is what we call them forward-looking process to say what should our price level will be over the coming 12 to 18 whatever months we are selecting trends for frequency and severity, and they are informed as Tricia said by macro and economical views, but also a little more specific views such as the cost of Lumber, but obviously that is a near-term spike over the long-term. We're not sure where that goes. And we would have taken a little more holistic approach to selecting in that case the severity trend for the price level going forward.

Q - Josh Shanker{BIO 5292022 <GO>}
All right. Well, this is a lot to digest in there and I appreciate the answers.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Thanks Josh.

Operator
Thank you. Your next response is from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.

Q - Gary Ransom{BIO 3446828 <GO>}
Good morning. I wanted to ask about quoting and conversion. I think I see your conversion is up a lot. That's probably is explained by accurate matching of price and risk, but on the quote side, you're doing something powerful that gets people in the funnel in the first place. And you have a big flow of customers. So if I'm sitting at home, whether I have a stimulus check or not. Maybe -- I'm a Robinson and at some point, I decide I'm going to go shopping. Just wondering what sort of the key ingredients of being successful at getting that customer into get a Progressive quotes.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes, Gary. I think a lot of it is our brand. So we started out -- I started out one of the answers with 10 years ago, 11 years ago, our brand would be different. It's about awareness and people know who Progressive is they know our brand, it's a solid brand, it's a reputable brand. So that's kind of awareness get you on the shortlist and then when you're on the shortlist and you shop our competitive prices and our broad coverage gets you in the door.

So we believe that we've obviously spent a lot more on brand another 25% increase in this quarter, and again we were spending a lot in expanding our broad coverage. So if you're sitting on the couch in your Robinson and you want to buy an auto and home on your phone or your iPad or you want to call in or you want to go to your agent. We tried to be where, when and how you want to shop. Just to make it easy for our customers and those -- then you have competitive prices. So I think that is really important and that goes of course into our segmentation and understanding rate to risk.

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Gary to that I would add, a much of our advertising is mass media, but a massive portion of our advertising spend is in digital media and that can be sort of display stuff, but it is increasingly what we call digital auctions and there are multiple digital auctions, marketplaces on the web these days and I would give huge kudos to our Digital Media Group, because they use the analytical powers that are inherent in Progressive people and make great real time decisions, meaning where should we spend more, where should we spend less. They also do it and recognizing the lifetime value of the prospects that are looking to quote.

So you can imagine if we have a longer retaining customer owns direct we can spend more, if it's shorter, you get the whole concept there. So I think we are pretty good in that space and that has been a space that has been growing for us a lot for a number of years now. The other important thing to do is once you get the person in the front door, you got to get them to the price and that is not as simple as you might assume. There are multiple avenues where customers can decide to quit quoting process and we optimize continuously to make that funnels that starts at the top of the flow as you said, get as efficient as possible to get them a quote and then obviously to translate their quote to buy. So I think a lot of this is our great people, great analytical skills, massive datasets. And I think we're doing some impressive things there.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
And the only thing I would say. This is a little bit off, but once they're in and you do have an incident or accident. I believe we have industry-leading claim service. We're out there. We care. We're there when you need us most, I talked about that a lot when there's caps that we can't control the weather. All we can control is how we treat you as a customer. And we've always gotten really high marks on that. Did you have another question, Gary?

Q - Gary Ransom{BIO 3446828 <GO>}
Yes, I was just going to follow-up on the 25% ad spend to, based on what you said is that -- is it reasonable to assume that a lot of that growth was more in the digital space?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes, when we look over the years and we look to take the last 10, 15 years we look when people bought on phones now when they're buying digital it is the highest rate of growth.

Q - Gary Ransom{BIO 3446828 <GO>}
Yes. Just one little more on the same topic. Just is, if I look at the body of science that you're putting into this in terms of the quoting process and all of that and kind of compare it to the body of science you have for matching price and risk. Are they both just as robust?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I think so. I mean I think when you look at our ability to continue to have new product models coming out where we can even more accurately price rates are risk can get to that preferred customer. We just continue to excel on that. And then on the buying analytical side, I'll concur with John. We have an incredible team. We do a lot of our buying and how. So it's proprietary to us. We have an incredible team that understands both the art and science around branding and then getting in our customers at or below our allowable costs. So both are highly analytical teams of people that we continue to invest in.

Q - Gary Ransom{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

Thank you. Your next response is from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Please go ahead.

Q - Adam Klauber{BIO 1494359 <GO>}
Thanks, good morning. Excuse me. The commercial auto is clearly growing price comparisons, but I think you called out that the for hire is growing rapidly and to get that makes sense with the economy kicking up, but I guess what are you doing different in that line of business and in particular is more of that business being distributed through the direct and digital.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes, I think we were ready not intentionally, but when the pandemic happened and more truck drivers decided to go from big firms to their own by their own tractor-trailer, because spot rate coverage went up. So we were ready and we priced well and we look at that very closely, because we've grown substantially, both on the direct side and the agency side. For many years, we saw the majority of all of our commercial auto on the agency side. But again, we want to be where, when and how our customers want to shop.

So there was for commercial auto overall, not necessarily for hire trucking. The highest growth in the direct commercial auto ever came in March of this year and that's where we normalized for our four or five week month, only best by January of this year and then August of last year. So we were ready kind of make hay when the sun shines, we are ready for when this happened. We feel great about the trends and the underlying cost. We also are careful about that, because it is high limit coverage. And so we have selected a 12% severity trend making us very comfortable with our reserves. I think we are in the right place at the right time. We feel like we're more than adequately reserved and we're excited about this new business on both the direct and agency.

Q - Adam Klauber{BIO 1494359 <GO>}
Great. Okay and then my follow-up in your letter, you mentioned that VMT is down 8% to 10% versus prior years through the end of March in the first week of April. You say that frequency of claims compared to last year is coming up, but in end of March, early April. But as frequency of claims, how does frequency of claims in the end of March early April compared to say 2017 through 2019.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Okay. Comparing it, let's come first and compare it to what's happening now so VMTs were down about 10% to 12% in March, early April. Then it went down to 8% to 10 %, it's back up to 10% to 12%. Our claims has not caught up yet. We are starting just in really recent data starting to see features grow, hasn't caught up yet. I'm not surprising. Compared to 2017 through 2019. What would you say, John?

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Well, so we don't actually provide our raw frequency numbers. So I'm sure you're trying to do that math yourself. And we don't give you the exact data port. Recognize as well that overall frequency trends for a number of years now have been negative, obviously with the pandemic it took a step function down. We look at the frequency, we look at a lot of things not only versus '19, but sort of a range of '17 to '19 and frequency is still down from we'll call that generally that area were recognized as well that before the pandemic frequency was dropping.

So I'm sure we're trying to do a look through to what is April, May, June, et cetera. Look like ahead it -- it's even difficult for us to know, but I wouldn't forget those long-term frequency trends for a lot of reasons. I have been negative and of course over the longer-term offset more than offset by severity and that's why the industry has been growing, but I would think through that when you're trying to project that what frequency is going to look like for the rest of the year.

Thank you. Your next response is from Tracy Benguigui of Barclays. Please go ahead.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
Thank you. Just a follow-up on loss trends. Are you anticipating any delays in seeing claims as the economy reopened? I'm thinking about medical procedures that might have been delayed during a pandemic. I mean you booking extra IBNR for that possibility?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Well, when we get an injury claim or a PIP claim or a medical claim or specifically injury. We are -- we have an estimate on what we believe will be the cost depending again how long that claim is open and what actually happened. And then the adjusters can come in and see if they believe it's less or more and it can be influenced by data as it unfolds. I think early on, we saw sort of a stall, not necessarily in treatments. But more importantly I think surgeries and of course there is not a huge amount of surgeries (inaudible). A lot of our injuries are soft tissue injuries and so on a lot of this can even heal on their own. What we did see was a closure of course and so we can see that open up as well, but I don't, but that data that we have years-and-years worth should already be priced in.

Q - Tracy Benguigui{BIO 21808177 <GO>}
Got it. Also, in your view what is the quality of drivers in the for-hire space as folks are looking for employment.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I think that varies. I think that really varies. We feel great about the business that we are putting on our books. We watch that very closely. I think a lot of it depends just like an auto on driver maturity. And right now with the driver shortage, we can see -- you could see that changing. Overall, the industry, we have not seen that. But we'll watch that closely to make sure again that we price rate to risks for so that segment.

Thank you. Your next response is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Meyer Shields{BIO 4281064 <GO>}
Thanks. I know it was, you've talked in the past about how severity is reasonably predictable in auto and frequency less so. So you have to respond to that. I was hoping you could talk about how you view that in the context of the property book where policies are 12 months rather than six?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes, I think we -- largely in property. We look at the age of the structure, the age of the roof, the location is in a hail prone state et cetera and that's right now. We're going to continue to understand deeper segmentation in the property space. And so I think that will change over time and we'll have more variables that we look at even on the property side. Really the property, the outcome, the CR has been really solely on catastrophes and freely a lot in Texas. I mean there has been several things in Texas that have happened, but we look at that and because of that -- I talked about the rate increases, we put into place last year and next year. We will also look at making sure that we have certain restrictions where we believe we may or may not want to grow. Do you want to add anything John to that?

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
No, I think it's very similar and obviously the models use what we call a trend-to date with those trends that take into account duration to policies. You mentioned property is being 12 months. The commercial business is predominantly 12 months as well and we have, I think it's close to 10% now of our agency book and put my policy somewhere around there. So it's the same process, it's just a further out trend to generally.

Q - Meyer Shields{BIO 4281064 <GO>}
Okay, that's helpful. If you can switch quickly to the small, I guess the [ph]bauxite of commercial. Does the current competitive environment change, the timeline for Progressive ramping up there?

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Well, when the pandemic initially started, we rolled out up in a few states and we kind took a pause to reassess not whether we're going to go in, but just reassess sort of what states we want to do audit, our computer system et cetera. And we are now rolling out very quickly many, many states. We're very excited about it.

Remember, when we think about small business, we think about employees of 20 or less almost micro businesses that is growing very rapidly, albeit on a very small base. But we're excited about what we're learning. We feel good about where we're at from a rate perspective. So we are and can talk about this more in August. I mean, have here comps. I know there's a lot of questions on commercial. I don't have our outline where we're at on all the BMT and especially (inaudible) and small business and fleet. but we are very excited to continue to roll that out aggressively.

Q - Meyer Shields{BIO 4281064 <GO>}
Okay, great. Thank you very much.

(Operator Instructions). Your next response is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Brian Meredith{BIO 3108204 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, good morning Tricia.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Good morning Brian.

Q - Brian Meredith{BIO 3108204 <GO>}
Quick question here for you. Could we -- to rate or the average written premium per policy decline a little bit here. How much of that is rate driven the minus 3% versus how much is just rising deductibles or changes in coverage. Is that the customers have been implementing during the economic downturn?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
I would say the majority is our rates, our reduction rates. We had several customers call in sometimes they were delaying payments, but not huge changes in coverages. I would say rate would be the primary reason behind our reduction average written premium.

Q - Brian Meredith{BIO 3108204 <GO>}
Great, that's helpful. And then my second question, I'm just curious. So I know a lot of homeowners and policies have will call it inflation cards are inflation-protected in them that are built in that kind of gradually raise your premiums over time to account for inflation, does your auto insurance policies carry that as well, does have potential offset here if we do see some rising in severity?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
We have some things that we had in place for years that actually take a factor into place every month for inflation on the auto side.

A - John Sauerland{BIO 15055737 <GO>}
Yes, it's degree that transpires in home generally in the home is driven predominantly by the replacement cost inflation. So something like lumber would be factored into how we would assess your replacement cost at year renewal. On the auto side, we have built in what we call monthly rating factors. So this is just an acknowledgment that generally speaking over time trend in average losses is positive and so we baked that in to the pricing algorithm, so that every month we see modest increases in premiums in those states. We don't have those in all states. It's not a huge impact on average premium and it does help ensure all else equal a positive trend in average premium and auto.

Q - Brian Meredith{BIO 3108204 <GO>}
Great, thank you. I appreciate it.

Thank you, your next response is from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Q - Josh Shanker{BIO 5292022 <GO>}
Thank you for taking more than one question from me. I appreciate it. I noticed that our sequential policy count growth in property was the best in March 2021, since I guess going back to September 2018. I know there's a lot of new housing starts and not people moving houses and whatnot. But also there is the amount of appetite debt, Progressive might have for wanting those risks. It does seem that your growth in property slowed down in the last few years and validating right now. Can we talk a little about appetite, how it relates both to your desire to convert to Robinsons and in general, how it relates to CAT aggregation and what not is the funnel opening up for property compared to where it was a year-ago?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes, I think it depends on the stage acts. So a couple of things, one, we've invested a lot direct side with our HomeQuote Explorer, so having Progressive Property and other third-party not affiliate companies we work with. So we've continued to do that and continue to have more and more of those companies have a buyback, which makes it really easy to be able to combine the Auto Home and buy it online.

On the agency side, we've increased our Platinum agents have a little bit over 4,000 platinum agents now. So again more ability to bide us. We want to make money on the property side, and so we have been, I think we're in 47 states now, we want to go across the country and for years we were, we had a lot of density in Texas, Florida that area and we continued to, but we also want to grow out of those and do the right thing in terms of segmentation.

So our appetite is we want to grow as fast as we can, but our other part of that of course is we want to make our target profit margins. So we look at those states, we look at ex-CAT to try to understand where we believe the underlying, our price is accurate and as I said we're increasing rates and trying to understand segmentation, a little bit more deeply. So we want to grow that, we want to grow Robinsons that's one of the reasons why we've made so many big investments, but we need to make money on that product.

Q - Josh Shanker{BIO 5292022 <GO>}
Can you give us any sense about how the percentage of auto policy, if you have that are bundled whether by a Progressive property policy or HomeQuote Explorer balance sheet?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes, the HomeQuote Explorer. So I would say overall in Robinsons take that were about 10%.

Q - Josh Shanker{BIO 5292022 <GO>}
10% of your auto market shares, Rob at this point.

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}

Hi, thanks for taking another question from me, Tricia, I just wanted to just maybe talk about the Road Test offering in a bit more detail and just see where that stands if you have plans to roll it out on a broader scale and how much, how traction has been there?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
We've been, we continue to be challenged a little bit with the economics on Road Test, so we're redefining some of the metrics and I would say on that more to come. We continue to develop there but we need to make the economics work.

Q - David Motemaden{BIO 18818634 <GO>}
Got it. And what is it about the economics maybe flush that out a little bit like what is the sticking point that you see that make it hard for the economics to work there?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
There are several different things. I'd rather have us outline exactly what's working, what is working and hopefully that will be soon.

Thank you, your next response is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Hi, thanks. My first question on, obviously just announced the Protective acquisition and I recognize you're waiting kind of so that closes to give us more details there. But just as you broadly think about additional M&A from here. I know obviously Progressive has often shied away from M&A except in a couple of unique circumstances. So can you just provide us kind of your current view on anything that might cause you additional transactions down the road?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
We have corporate development department that is under Andrew Quigg in our Strategy Group, he always kind of like searches the landscape to see things, acquisitions are hard and it's hard for us, specifically I think because of our culture and that's why the limited number that we've done, we have felt have great products, great culture fit with us and could be cumulative.

So I've talked a few times about the AFI acquisition, we didn't have the ability to bundle customers in agency channel that gives us that, we talked a little bit about the Protective and thank you for allowing us to talk more about that after the transaction closes. So I'll always look at what does it bring to Progressive that we can't grow organically or that will help us get to market faster. And that's kind of how I see it and we're always taking a look. But again, I want to be able to does that give us access to customers, access to technology or the ability to get to market faster is kind of how I look at acquisitions.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Great. And then my second question, you had mentioned that Snapshot Apron Relief product last quarter and then there was a little bit of color within your letter in the Q, but I'm just wondering, it seems like it's still early, but are there any like observations that you noted kind of some switching right that shorter on driving period relative to other products just in general observation?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes, so we have it in 43 states and we again like you said early. So could unfold. We sent out communications to about 14 million customers and about 40,000 of those enrolled. So to have that 30 days, so far, 9,400 have reached that 30 day point and a pretty small percentage about 4% have called us to join the program.

And we still feel very proud of the fact that we did that because it does allow people to reduce their rates, if they're driving less or their behavior of driving differs. So again, we still have some time before all the customers rollout but a relatively small percentage has actually joined in the Snapshot program.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
Is the idea to keep this going like obviously with tied right to the pandemic and the impact that that's had on driving behavior. But the idea to keep an option of a shorter driving monitor period available indefinitely or is there kind of you only might have this for a certain time period?

A - Tricia Griffith{BIO 5482375 <GO>}
Yes, we have this program in place till July of this year.

Q - Elyse Greenspan{BIO 17263315 <GO>}
