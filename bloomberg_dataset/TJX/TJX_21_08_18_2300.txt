Ernie L. Herrman{BIO 6943642 <GO>}
Good morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is Scott Goldenberg. I'd like to start our call today by once again, thanking all of our global associates for their continued hard work and dedication to TJX. We are especially grateful for their efforts over the past 18 months and for their commitment to the health and safety of our associates and customers.

Now to an overview of our second quarter results. First, I am extremely pleased that our overall open-only comp store-sales, when compared to our fiscal year 2020 or calendar year 2019 increased an outstanding 20% which well exceeded our plans. Comp growth in home continue to be excellent, and we also saw a very strong low-teens comp increase in apparel, as that category continued its upward trend this quarter. We were particularly pleased with the strong execution we saw across each of our divisions, which all drove double-digit open-only comp sales growth versus fiscal 2020. Clearly, our branded mix and great values continue to resonate with consumers in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia.

Next, overall sales were $12.1 billion over $2 billion more than the second quarter of fiscal 2020, and overall segment profit increased more than $300 million over the same period. We're convinced that our sales growth and profit in the second quarter demonstrate that we are capturing profitable market share. We are confident that many of our loyal customers have returned to our stores and are shopping with us more frequently and that we are attracting new shoppers with our marketing and exciting treasure-hunt shopping experience.

Third, I am very pleased with the sequential improvement of our pre-tax margin versus the first quarter. Our strong sales growth and merchandise margin increase more than offset the persistent expense headwinds we have been facing. The buying environment has been excellent and our teams have done a terrific job sourcing the right mix of goods and getting them to our stores to satisfy the strong customer demand.

Lastly, second quarter earnings per share are $0.64 were also well above our plans. As a reminder, this includes a negative $0.15 impact from a debt extinguishment charge and the impact from our temporary store closures. Our strong earnings per share in the second quarter were over EPS of $0.62 in fiscal 2020.

Now, I'll turn it over to Scott to cover more of our second quarter financial results in more detail.

Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
Thanks, Ernie. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Ernie's comments and thank all of our global associates for their hard work and continued commitment to our business.

I'll start with some additional details of our second quarter results. As Ernie mentioned, overall open-only comp store sales increased 20% over fiscal '20, well above our plans and segment profit was very strong. In the second quarter, we continued to see an increase in our average of basket across all divisions, driven by customers putting more items into their carts.

Overall, average ticket was down slightly versus fiscal '20, but improved significantly compared to the first quarter, primarily due to the improved strength in apparel. Further, average ticket improved each month of the quarter and was up in July. Overall customer traffic in the United States, where we were open the entire quarter with minimal occupancy restrictions was up mid-single digits versus fiscal '20.

Across each of our divisions' second quarter open-only comp store sales growth was also excellent and exceeded our plans. At Marmaxx open-only comp store sales increased an outstanding 18% and profit dollars were up 19% versus fiscal '20. Marmaxx's home business continued its excellent performance and once again, posted a comp increase in line with HomeGoods. Apparel comps were up mid-teens and improved significantly versus the first quarter. Further, sales were strong across all geographies and by age of store.

At HomeGoods open-only comps increased a phenomenal 36% with consistent strength across all major categories and geographic regions for HomeGoods and HomeSense. We are also very pleased with HomeGoods' profit dollars which were up 42% versus fiscal '20. As a reminder, HomeGoods margin is disproportionately impacted by freight increases due to its product mix and further pressured by supply chain costs related to its new distribution center and wages. When looking at our HomeGoods, Marmaxx and HomeGoods divisions combined versus fiscal '20, total open-only comp store sales for the US increased 21% and profit dollars were up 22%.

During the second quarter, Canada, Europe and Australia each faces -- each faced challenges with temporary store closures and occupancy restrictions. Despite these limitations, we saw a very healthy sales when we were open with TJX's Canada second quarter open-only comp store sales increasing 18%; and TJX's international comp sales increasing 12%. Moving on, overall sales increased 22% over the second quarter of fiscal '20.

As we detailed in our press release this morning, we estimate that sales were negatively impacted by about $300 million to $350 million, due to the temporary closing of our stores for about 3% of the quarter. Pre-tax margin for the second quarter was 8.7%. This includes 200 basis point negative impacts due to a debt extinguishment charge and an estimated 60 basis points negative impact from the temporary store closures. Net COVID costs, moderated significantly versus the first quarter and negatively impacted pre-tax margin by only 30 basis points in the second quarter. Again, we are extremely pleased with our improved pre-tax margin in the second quarter. Our very strong sales and excellent merchandise margin increase more than offset the 150 basis points of incremental freight expense, the substantial supply chain and wage costs, and higher incentive compensation of accruals.

Moving to the bottom line, second quarter earnings per share were $0.64 and well above our plans. Second quarter EPS includes $0.15 negative impact due to the debt extinguishment charge and an estimated $0.05 to $0.07 negative impact from the temporary store closures. Again, EPS in the second quarter of fiscal '20 was $0.62 per share. As for balance sheet inventory, it was down 3% on a constant currency basis versus the second quarter of fiscal '20. Store inventories were down, but essentially where we want them to be. And our distribution incentives, inventory was lower as we have less pack away and more goods on order and in transit. Our buyers are doing a great job sourcing merchandise and have been able to chase the goods we need to satisfy the current strong consumer demand. To reiterate, the availability of merchandise is excellent.

Moving on to our cash flow and liquidity. During the second quarter, we generated $1.4 billion and operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $7.1 billion in cash. In June, we completed the make-whole calls for $2 billion of principal outstanding notes which resulted in a pre-tax debt extinguishment charge of $242 million. As a result of these actions, we have reduced our outstanding debt by $2.75 billion this year and lowered our annual interest expense by over $90 million.

As for the shareholder distributions, in the second quarter, we've returned $614 million to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs. For the full year, we have increased our stock buyback by 250 million and now expect to repurchase 1.25 billion to 1.5 billion of TGX stock.

Now, I will turn it back to Ernie.

Ernie L. Herrman{BIO 6943642 <GO>}
Thanks, Scott. Looking ahead, I'd like to highlight the opportunities that we believe will allow us to drive sales and traffic in the second half of the year. First, we are convinced that our relentless focus on value is a tremendous advantage. In an inflationary environment we believe even more consumers will be seeking out value. We are confident that our value position will be a very attractive option for consumers looking to stretch their dollars without sacrificing on quality and brands.

Second, we are excited about our store and online merchandising plans for the back half of the year, especially the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. The marketplace is loaded with a great selection of apparel and home merchandise across good, better, and best brands. We have enormous confidence that our teams will execute on these initiatives to bring consumers the right brands and fashions at the right values every day.

Next, we are planning exciting marketing campaigns for television and digital media for the fall and holiday season. We believe these campaigns will help us continue to attract new shoppers and stay top of mind with our existing customers. Each of our divisions will showcase are differentiated shopping experience by reinforcing our value leadership, while also highlighting discovery, fashion and quality. Further, and then ever evolving media landscape, we continue to learn and adapt to new digital outlets, so that we can broaden our consumer reach and ensure we are connecting with shoppers on the platforms, where they are spending their time.

Additionally, our research tells us that overall our marketing campaigns and great assortment of values continue to attract new shoppers of all ages into our stores, including an outsized number of Gen Z and millennial shoppers. We are also encouraged by our strong overall customer satisfaction scores. Lastly, while most of our European and Canadian stores were open in the second quarter, many of them were still operating with stringent COVID related occupancy restrictions. Many of these restrictions have eased and assuming this trend continues, we expect overall sales and customer traffic to improve in the second half of the year in these regions. Further, with a significant number of permanent retail closures in these geographies over the last 18 months, we see a great opportunity to capture a bigger share of consumers' wallets going forward.

As to e-commerce, we continue to be pleased with the sales at our US and UK online businesses. We are excited to launch e-commerce on homegoods.com in the third quarter. We believe, this is something our existing customers have been waiting for and is another way for us to attract new shoppers. Similar to our other online businesses, homegoods.com will be complementary to our physical stores and allow customers to shop our great values 24 hours a day, 7 days, a week.

Beyond this year, we are convinced that we are set up extremely well to significantly grow our market share and improve our profitability. Let me take a moment and share the characteristics of our business that we believe, will continue to draw consumers to our retail banners going forward.

First, we are confident that the appeal of our treasure hunt shopping experience will continue to resonate with consumers. Our merchandise assortments are constantly changing. So there's always something new to surprise, excite, and inspire shoppers in our stores and online. Further, we offer great value every day. So our customers know they are getting excellent deals every time they visit and they don't have to think about coupons or promotions.

Second, we believe our stores offer consumers a much more eclectic assortment of merchandise versus traditional department in specialty stores. Our more than 1,100 global buyers are in the marketplace every week sourcing fresh exciting merchandise from a universe of about 21,000 vendors around the world. Our planning and allocation teams curate these goods to create a differentiated store-by-store mix that we believe no one else is offering.

Next, we locate our stores in convenient easy to access locations to make it easy for shoppers to visit our stores in a timely and efficient way. For example, in the U.S., we estimate that we have a T.J. Maxx or a Marshal store within 10 miles of approximately 80% of the population. Our retail banners are located across urban, suburban and rural markets, which allows us to reach consumers across a very wide customer demographic. Lastly, the flexibility of our business model allows us to adjust our buying, store formats, and distribution to take advantage of hot categories and brands, and adapt to changing consumer preferences.

In terms of profitability. I want to emphasize that we are highly focused on improving our pre-tax margin profile next year and beyond. Clearly, our ability to keep gaining market share and drive outsize sales is our best opportunity. In addition, we feel great about the opportunities we are pursuing that we believe, will help offset the margin pressures that we have seen over the last several years. One of these is to surgically look for opportunities to adjust retails in select areas, while maintaining our great values to our shoppers. Just as we have throughout our history. Scott, will discuss this in more detail in a moment.

Now, I would like to share some information about corporate responsibility at TJX. For our nearly 45 year history, our mission has been consistent to deliver great value every day. And similarly, since the very beginning, we have also committed to acting as a responsible corporate citizen. Throughout the pandemic, the health and safety of our associates and our customers has been a top priority and remain so today. Simultaneously, over the past year and a half, important issues like equity and racial justice and climate change have become even more critical. To be clear, these are areas that we have been committed to for many years and are proud of the actions we have taken recently to make additional progress.

Let me share a few key points on these. In terms of equity and racial justice, for our 45-year history, we have been committed to making TJX an inclusive workplace. In June, we shared with our associates and on TJX.com the most recent steps that we are taking to help us become a more inclusive and diverse organization at all levels. These efforts include initiatives related to recruitment practices associate education, training and development, and an expanded focus on our process and programs to support an inclusive work environment. We know we have work to do and are committed to improving in this important area. As to the increasing importance of environmental sustainability, we have made progress working towards the goal we set last June, for a science-based greenhouse gas emissions target mapped to the Paris climate agreement 1.5 degrees Celsius guidelines. In the coming weeks, we'll make our annual update to the environmental sustainability portion of TJX.com, including information about our climate and energy strategy along with waste and chemicals management.

These are just a few of our initiatives. We recognize there is an increasing interest in our efforts related to environmental, social, and governance or ESG practices. And we look forward to keeping you update on our progress. Our commitment to corporate responsibility is as important as ever. And as always, there was a lot of information on TJX.com. In closing, I want to again, thank each of our associates around the globe who stepped up to support the business and helped us achieve outstanding second quarter results. I could not be prouder of the collective efforts of our associates over the past 18 months and their commitment to working as one TJX throughout this health crisis.

I am extremely pleased with our excellent top and bottom line performance in the second quarter and I am optimistic on the remainder of the year. As an off-price leader, and every country we operate in. I'm convinced that TJX is set up extremely well to gain market share for many years to come. I am confident, that our sales and traffic initiatives as well as our global store growth plans will draw even more shoppers to our retail banners.

In terms of the bottom line, we are very confident in the opportunities we see to drive higher profit margins beyond this year. I truly believe the characteristics of our off-price business model will continue to be a winning retail formula and that TJX is on its way to becoming $60 billion plus revenue company.

Now, I'll turn the call back to Scott for a few additional comments, and then we'll open it up for questions.

Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
Thanks again, Ernie, and just a few brief notes before we move to Q&A. In terms of the third quarter, we are very pleased that overall open-only comp store sales trends are up very strongly to start the quarter at the mid-teens level. This is despite what we believe is a negative sales impact from the Delta variant that we've seen since the last week of July. Currently all of our stores in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, are open and approximately 40 of our Australian stores are closed. While we are not planning for overall store closures in the third quarter to be significant, sales could also be negatively impacted if new COVID related regulations are put in place.

As we mentioned in the press release, due to continued uncertainty with COVID, we're not providing guidance for the third quarter or the second half of the year today. Lastly, I want to pick up on Ernie's point about improving our margin profile next year and beyond, as we pursue opportunities both on the macro level and within our business.

First, while we expect the combination of freight, supply chain, and wage costs to be higher in the back half of the year. We do not envision freight and wage beginning -- we do envision freight and wage beginning to moderate as we move through next year.

Second to the extent, we can drive outsized comps, that is the easiest way for us to improve our margin going forward. Further, we will remain focused on continuing to buy even better and opening more vendors. Also we are seeing a less promotional environment and rising inflation, as well as stronger sales in our apparel categories. We see all of these factors as opportunities for higher retails. At the same time, we remain laser focused on continuing to offer consumers great values, just as we have throughout our 45 year history.

In closing, we feel great about the strength of the business both operationally and financially and we are confident that we are capturing market share. We are extremely pleased to be in a strong financial position to make important investments in our business and return significant value to our shareholders through both our share buyback and dividend programs. Now, we're happy to take your questions, as we do every quarter. We are going to ask that you please limit your questions to one per person and one part to each question. We respectfully ask that everyone stick with this request, both to keep the con schedule and so that we can answer questions from as many analysts as we can.

Thanks, and now, we'll open it up for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Lorraine Hutchinson. Your line is open.

Q - Lorraine Hutchinson{BIO 4433440 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning. Ernie, you made a -- and, Scott, you made a few references toward adjusting retails and I was just curious, was that specifically for HomeGoods or was that across the entire portfolio of brands of brands, and how do you balance increasing your prices with also providing great value to the customer?

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
Sure, Lorraine. Great question. First of all, when we refer to, we are talking about all of the businesses. We believe, perhaps there might be a little bit more opportunity that we're seeing in the home [ph] area, but we are in effect talking about all of the banners. We also have seen that, we started the -- a big change from the first quarter when we had talked about this as we want a more wait and see what happens around us. As you would have expected with the inflation the cost pressures that I think all the other retailers are receiving we're observing that there is less promotion as well as more pockets than we saw a quarter ago quarter ago in terms of ability to raise retail surgically and selectively in certain areas of the store. Again, that applies not just in the HomeArea. Even though, I think, go HomeArea is disproportionately a place where we'll -- do more of that.

We also think that -- the freight that is hit everybody, by the way is created fright in wage, which is -- we all knew this could be an unusual time to see this opportunity. First quarter again, when we talked about this. We were going to be looking hard at it. We have just seen the ability to do that more than we -- were thinking we could do before. I'm sorry, the second, what was your second part of the question?

Q - Lorraine Hutchinson{BIO 4433440 <GO>}
Just how you think about raising prices, but also still provide (Multiple Speakers)

A - Ernie L. Herrman{BIO 6943642 <GO>}
The maintaining value I think, what you were questioning, right? So, we mentioned, I mentioned in the script, but we bought them up this strategy it's a little like we used to talk to on our average ticket and we'd say, our ticket was down or whatever, although, that's been moderating and a nice direction. We're feeling good about that upside as we move forward, but our buyers drive where the retail adjustment opportunities are, it is not top-down driven as far as what items we do that on. The first mission as always, and again, in the script, I mentioned this a couple times as we've done in our 40 plus year history. We're always making sure our retail adjustment is providing still a tremendous GAAP and value for us versus the out the door retails of competition.

So, buyers do not do that unless we are still showing a great value. So if it wasn't for the fact that the retails around us are up a little bit or less promotional, we wouldn't be able to do what we're doing there to the degree that we think we can do it and by the way, to the degree, which we think will be able to do it going forward.

We also feel the another cost pressure we have been dealing with for the last handful of years was the ticket lowering and in this environment what we're starting to see now is that moderating. Again, what Scott and I have looked at it with the teams as we look at next year. Really, as we get to fourth quarter into next year, I think we really start seeing the, really start seeing more opportunity to do more of what we just talked about, because we've just started this mission. I think we are in a great position to surgically look at the way we're retailing goods. Really throughout the whole corporation over the next couple of years. I think that's going that's going to bode well for us, but great questions.

Q - Lorraine Hutchinson{BIO 4433440 <GO>}
Thank you.

Operator
Next, we will hear from Matthew Boss. Your line is open.

Q - Matthew Boss{BIO 17343314 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, and congrats on a really nice quarter.

A - Ernie L. Herrman{BIO 6943642 <GO>}
Thank you, Matt.

Q - Matthew Boss{BIO 17343314 <GO>}
So Ernie, you cited material market share opportunity remaining, where are you the most excited from here? Scott, maybe just a follow-up on margins. Is there a way to rank the opportunities that you cited to improve profitability in the medium term and I guess what? I'm really trying to figure out is, is their opportunity to close the international. Profit margin gap or any structural constraints that would prevent Marmaxx from returning to that 13% to 14 %, operating margin profile as we think about it.

A - Ernie L. Herrman{BIO 6943642 <GO>}
Yes, so Matt. I will go first and then Scott will bat cleanup as they say. The market saw a market share demand we see it on a lot of fronts. Clearly the most obvious one is the HomeArea which we've talked about and in the script. We -- truly phenomenal results in our HomeArea. Yes. We see that as they continued strength in that we are so different.

You know this, our HomeArea is very fashion-driven, extremely fast-turning, its eclectic with great value, great brands, all the different categories in the world you would want and it's probably our most impulsive-oriented right form of shopping banner that we have. So when a customer walks in and let's talk, we didn't talk much about it earlier in the script about the entertainment treasure-hunt value in a HomeGoods. It is off the charts as we know, which is why we are having these just amazing outsize comps there. Just so, the home business throughout the corporation of the full family store.

So whether that's in Maxx or Marshalls the same thing applies. Our home businesses there are just as healthy and when we look at international, also very healthy. I would say the number one market share thing will continue to be home. However, as we mention in the call our apparel and some other areas of the store, which I don't want to put out there specifically right now, has been extremely healthy across men's, ladies, kids.

As those start to kick in as you know when our business that helps us with our average ticket, but it also helps us I think with continued market share gain, because based on a lot of store closures around us. A lot of them were branded apparel retailers where certain boxes have closed. I think this presents an unusual usual opportunity for us to continue to gain more market share because of our branded content being really second to none. I think in terms of also doing good, better and best which is another advantage we have when you look at some of our competition they tend to be a little narrower and there are scope of goods. They don't trade up as quite as high. I think that range for us will allow us to continue to gain. That's why I'm so excited about it.

Before I hand it over to Scott. The other thing I would like to say, is on the margins. That -- what we're seeing here is another plus is all of these areas just like Lorraine had asked me are presenting opportunities for us to either raise our ticket in total or adjust our retail surgically on select amount of goods -- and doing that in the need that in the right way, but I think that's going to kind of play out as we move forward next year. It does allow us a goal [ph]. You were asking Scott about the margins overall internationally et cetera, but we're feeling pretty bullish about really starting to get back to those double-digit margins as we look out to next year or getting very close and I'm sure Scott will and I'm talking in total, but I'm sure he will get into more of that international that you asked about.

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
Yes. So I think, Ernie. The setup is that we think we can do this across all divisions. I think we wouldn't be looking for any one division to get better. We're really looking for all divisions to get better than and getting not necessarily, it's not, I think as Ernie said, it's going to be a paced.

We have to see what, we want to we want to make sure we're doing this prudently, and do it right. But, it would be over the course of time. I think the first thing is, we get up to those double digits is, once we get there and go beyond is that we would be looked. I think it's mostly going to be through a strong merchandise margin, offsetting a lot of the cost pressures, but I think Ernie alluded to the higher average retail or the moderation in the retail I think then resulting in a higher average retail, will -- some of those expenses will moderate on the store and distribution and freight line as we get a higher average retail.

To be determined on the pace of that but it -- it could be two-thirds merchandize margin, one third on the expenses because you do get a significant benefit but a lot of that will be the pace and we'll have to see as we move through the fourth quarter into next year as we start buying and get this benefit that's when we would expect more EBIT [ph] to happen is next year.

I think the other point that Ernie was making is that once we get to those levels for the -- first point is get to a point where are -- we can leverage on a we'd be flat or better on a low, the three-four type of comp and that's what our expectations would be, in the longer-term of getting to that level. Once we get to that, then I think we'll be talking about higher overall pre-tax levels. But first, for many, many years we've been delivering [ph] on the slightly -- on some strong comps. I think now, would be how do we get to a point and we feel confident that we can do it that we can stop that bleeding but on a low to mid-single comp.

Q - Matthew Boss{BIO 17343314 <GO>}
That's great color. Best of luck.

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Michael Binetti. Your line is open.

Q - Michael Binetti{BIO 20477904 <GO>}
Hey guys, thanks for -- thanks for all the help -- they're on the AURs and the margins. I wanted to follow up with -- a question on SG&A. Scott, I think, we just run right [ph] out the SG&A in the quarter -- it could be trending $1.5 billion or even $2 billion in dollars higher than Calendar '19. I know there's -- but there were some COVID cost in there in the first quarter, but I don't think that was much of a -- an explanation in 2Q you gave us the 30 basis points. Could maybe you talk about what's in that base of dollars this year that sticks -- what becomes more leverageable? What's an investment this year? What are you investing in -- but what becomes more leverageable as you look out to 2022? I know a lot of the focus in your prior answer was on the shift in retail that you spoke about.

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
Yes. Let me unpack Q2 a little better because it's not straight. As you know, there is a lot of noise quarter-to-quarter and some there are things that are different quarter-to-quarter.

When you just look at the surface on our 28% overall growth in SG&A compared to the 23%, you say on the surface -- not that great and accounting for -- deleverage of -- the 70 basis points, but if you exclude then look at a per store base, just the COVID costs, which we don't believe will be hopefully around next year, -- we had proximately a 21% per store growth and about a 19% after stripping out COVID growth, leveraged a bit [ph] there.

There was one line item that we don't think will be as it was more of a catch-up due to the strong sales growth over our own plans in profit both in the first and second quarter made us do a bit of a catch-up on a lot of line items on the incentive accruals. It's a bit, just the way when things are either lower than plan or underwater and then all of a sudden a catch-up, we had a bit of that. When you strip out the incentive accruals this quarter, we had approximately 6% growth per store on a 10% comp growth when you look at it over two years.

Remember a lot of these are over a two-year period. I would say that we feel pretty good and when you look to the third quarter, although, not giving guidance that incentive accruals will be some of it, but much, much, much less. The level of deleverage, if there is deleverage will be less than what it is this quarter. So when you strip out, a just two line items, which we don't think are comparable and not necessarily go forward. We feel pretty good about that.

In terms of long-term goal going forward, little hard to say that will depend on the level of sales, and the level of what Ernie said, on the growth on the average ticket, so too early to call. But, don't see anything in the SG&A that's unusual other than the same level of minimum wage growth that we would expect to see, going forward.

A - Ernie L. Herrman{BIO 6943642 <GO>}
So if I -- if I try to orient that to the past, you think about a three comp, was it -- 3%,inflation on SG&A, was about normal, maybe a little higher per store, per foot; however, you want to measure it and then put in the past more of the comp was driven by unit volume that came with a lot of AUC cost. I think AURs and the surgicals flow through at a much higher rate. So if more the growth (multiple speakers)

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
That one. That would (multiple speakers) Exactly. And we have to see that level of growth is on the AUR exactly.

Our next question will come from Kimberly Greenberger. Your line is open.

Q - Kimberly Greenberger{BIO 3277763 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Thanks so much. So nice to see the momentum here in the business. I wanted to sort of tackle, the unpacking the operating margin in the slightly different way, but if we could just start with the 150 basis points that you called out in incremental freight expense as well as supply chain and wage costs. Scott, could you break down the 150 and is the incentive comp in that 150 as well?

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
No, then sorry, I -- I already noticed that a few people. I thought, obviously, we weren't as clear as we thought we were. The 150 is just freight. We had other deleveraged in terms of supply chain and wage as well then, obviously, we called out the impact from the store closure. The 150 was just freight and that's a combination of both freight, which is inbound and outbound, but also our ocean freight.

Ocean freight is probably the bigger sticky one for at least the near-term. The rates increases have been up on both intermodal and on trucking in the ocean freight and that's why we talked and put in. We believe the costs are still going up higher in the back half as ocean freight rates have in some cases gone up 200% which we would expect in the third quarter and fourth quarter. We don't think this level of freight deleverage which will be more than that 150 basis points -- at least what we're seeing now.

We'll be at the sustained levels if they are, that means the sales levels are going to continue because that means there's a tremendous demand. We would expect those to moderate to some degree and hopefully a lot as we move through next year. On top of the 150 basis points, we had deleverage, from wage, we also had the bonus accruals which was a substantial amount and some supply chain. Again the strong leverage on the 20 comp and the strong merchandise margin more than offset all that.

Q - Kimberly Greenberger{BIO 3277763 <GO>}
Okay. Got it. As I think about just sort of your drawing the bridge from your operating margin in the quarter 8.7%, add that two points were debt extinguishment, 50 basis points for closures; 30 basis points for COVID. Then we get to like, 11.6%. If you were to get all the freight back next year that would, that would suggest like a 13%[ph] or so margin. Obviously, you probably not going to get all of that back next year, but it sounds like that 13% sort of adjusted result this year. You think that there were still some higher cost in there with supply chain wages and incentive compensation. And those would be leverageable in future years. (multiple speakers) am I hearing you correctly?

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
Yes. Again to the extent, it's not just that linear like that. Overall, correct we also the merchandize margin was extremely -- you get a lot of benefit from -- on the markdown line that might not be at the same level because of the '20 comp. But overall, we see more positives than negative, but I just can't add up all the positives and take out all the negatives to your point because it may, we still going to, we still may have some incremental increases off of this year just at a moderating rate.

Q - Kimberly Greenberger{BIO 3277763 <GO>}
Right. Okay. Great. (multiple speakers)

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
(multiple speakers) would be higher, it's the question of how high. You just can't add it all back in the end.

A - Ernie L. Herrman{BIO 6943642 <GO>}
We don't know that, Kimberly, it's a good discussion, but we don't know of the freight necessarily go significantly down as a rate next year which you are saying, I mean that would be great -- I mean, certainly, add to our bullishness on those double-digit margins but --

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
Yeah. Another way to look at it though would be, we'd like to think you can run double digit comps forever, but you might not be able to. You have to also back down what happens if you go to a more normalized comp -- you'll have less leverage, but then you'll have also less expense. It -- I think there's a lot of moving factors. I think what Ernie said is as you approach and be double digits when you get to a lower comp, that we think it's about being not deleveraging and over time leveraging on that lower comp.

Q - Kimberly Greenberger{BIO 3277763 <GO>}
Yes, in order to deliver those higher margins over time. That's interesting. Thank you so much.

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
That's right. Exactly.

A - Ernie L. Herrman{BIO 6943642 <GO>}
Right. Yes.

Our next question will come from Paul Lejuez. Your line is open.

Q - Paul Lejuez{BIO 6299659 <GO>}
Scott, I am sorry if I missed it. But did you say what - merchant [ph] margin was up this quarter this quarter -- and if you could provide any color by segment, and then just longer-term question for Ernie. Just talk about that $60 billion opportunity. I'm curious if you could talk about international growth and the role that plays in getting to that level. Maybe talk about the store opportunity in each of the markets that you operate in today versus new markets. Just how you thinking about that long-term? Thanks.

A - Ernie L. Herrman{BIO 6943642 <GO>}
Absolutely. So, I think I'll go first and then Scott will come back to you on the merchandize margin. Longer term, also great question Paul because we're looking at this all the times in terms of the growth because obviously we have a higher growth opportunity, international as a growth rate not necessarily in dollars. But we are -- you could see from the results of very pleased with our Open-only results in Canada. Europe, Australia has been absolutely terrific. We are also looking, we didn't get into it on that question a couple minutes ago, but we are looking at making some positive margin improvements in those divisions also over the next 18 months.

We feel there's opportunity there, regardless of what happens with exchange rates. We would love to see the exchange rate obviously going the right direction since we buy so much in US dollars specifically for Canada and Europe, but regardless of that, we're feeling very bullish on the market share opportunities.

Many store closures, Paul, in the UK and in Canada continue, and Canada is one of our most dominant market shares that we're already in. We have a higher market share there than we even do in the states, so, very bullish. I think more opportunity in terms of pure growth rate in Europe, in terms of new stores.

I think you mentioned new store opportunity. What we did there and you see in the cycle as when things got more challenging there, in terms of Brexit, margin, exchange rate, and then what was going on obviously with COVID, we pulled back on on-store openings there. But now we are we looking that at that and ramping it up to a more of a selectively obviously, because we have to look at the right sites that make sense for us in the different countries such as in Germany, where we still had a tremendous amount of new store opportunities and still do.

We're probably pretty bullish on that and obviously Poland and Austria and Netherlands -- all have performed well. Pretty bullish on margins and sales, overseas improving. One thing I would like to mention it ties-in with the new stores there as well as here is overall we are pretty -- we have a remodel program which we moderated recently during COVID. But now that as we can see, how strong were coming out of this and how well we're starting to -- so good about leveraging going forward, Scott and I have been looking at really ramping up our remodel program and all the divisions to continue with this market share. And that would apply to Europe and Canada in or not as much Australia because those are all relatively new. HomeGoods in Marmaxx specifically, because we're capturing all these new customers along with the existing customers and one of the best ways to invest cash and the use of our cash is to invest in the business and we feel remodels given what's going on for us right now, are a great return on investment in terms of maintaining our new customer shopper. I know you didn't kind of asked about that, but it does relate to I think our international opportunities as well.

And I'll turn it back to Scott as far as the merchandize margin.

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
Yes. Paul so --

Q - Paul Lejuez{BIO 6299659 <GO>}
Thanks.

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
Probably what you would expect given that, I said that we had freight pressures of all in approximately a 150 basis points, which included both our ocean freight and our -- all of our other domestic and inbound freight. We are up over -- we are up 70 basis points after including that freight. Approximately, 220 basis points up prior to freight.

We've really broken down half between mark-down and marks downs, markdowns and mark-on. Again, the markdowns was a function, some of it was a -- we had a little over accrual in some of our European business when we were closed, but it's just strong markdown performance across board and then, mark-on again was very strong as well. Again that's -- very pleased with that similar type of performance we had in the first quarter on that as well. The one thing we would say is that freight line feels to be pressured as we move at least move through the third and fourth quarter.

Q - Paul Lejuez{BIO 6299659 <GO>}
Thanks. Any breakdown by segment on merchant to margin?

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
No, breakdown.

Our next question will come from Omar Saad. Your line is open.

Q - Omar Saad{BIO 5302683 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question. Great job this quarter. You guys mentioned homegoods.com which is going to be launching in the third quarter. I'd love to get a little bit more of an update and some color around that. Is it going to be a similar strategy to what you've used in the Marmaxx division in terms of separate customers, separate inventory, kind of a separate -- differentiated experience versus what's going on in the stores?

I also -- and is there any opportunity to kind of create a more integrated experience in the home category versus some of your traditional categories, where you could have connected inventory between stores and online? Also Scott, if you don't mind, could you clarify the comment? I think you said, you've seen some Delta impact, from the Delta variant since late July. I'm assuming you mean Europe and Australia, but if you just clarify that? Thanks.

A - Ernie L. Herrman{BIO 6943642 <GO>}
All right, Omar, I'll go first. First of all, very excited about HomeGoods.com. As you know, boy, with some of our most passionate customers I think, you and I have talked about this in the past, right? Our home goods, customers are so passionate.

So with that, there was a little tweak in the strategy, and I think we've talked about this briefly, but you're asking for a little bit more color, which I'm happy to provide here. It is a little different in the approach than Marmaxx is for a couple of reasons. I think I mean I'm going to answer both of your questions at the same time because your second part of the question was is there any opportunities to have it a little more connected. We would say, yes. As opposed to having a different buying organization, completely which is we have at -- Maxx and Marshalls.

HomeGoods is our fastest turning most eclectic business that we have out there. So by a natural nature of the beast, even our HomeGoods stores tend to vary more from store to store. They turn so fast and there's so many SKUs. We've approached the HomeGoods online business to try to get the best of both worlds. We have, we are really leveraging actually our merchant organization in HomeGoods and we are really peeling off goods from our HomeGoods inventory and using that to create the site and the eventual shipping, but really using our merchants and our planning organizations are more joined together in HomeGoods than they are in are in Marmaxx.

The way we're buying, we have more point people at HomeGoods, but we're really buying the similar mix, which is I think what you were asking about. The other benefit is when you want to get multiple purchases, we tend to ship some things is not in complete sets, we ship a sets, but when they're in the store the customer could buy two of something and leave two chairs et cetera. This is where our homegoods.com business should be extremely complimentary, because that allows as a customer to be more connected like you were asking.

So, if somebody see something in the store and online, they can almost execute a buy -- a complimentary word all kind of goes together. You could really outfit a room or a whole look a little easier by kind of supplementing your in-store purchases with your online purchases with HomeGoods. And that's why it's been a bit of a different strategy on the way we're buying it, which by the which by the way, should leverage profit for our faster.

We don't have as much overhead as we do in the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls online as we do there, this is much leaner set up and we are currently playing with a shipping strategy on how we're going to ask the customer to pay for shipping. That might be a little different, but I won't get into that here. It's just what you need to know is it. It -- we believe, it's really set up to supplement in a very conducive way where we should get multiple purchases and it should actually help our store and online at the same time. A great question, though, the way you asked us because it is going to be executed differently. Now, I will have Scott.

Q - Omar Saad{BIO 5302683 <GO>}
Thanks Ernie.

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
The question I think was about the COVID in the -- as we moved started the third quarter. First, it was a-- you're right. We do have stores closed in Australia, wasn't real -- that really wasn't the really, what our comment was about that we put in there in the release and the script. It was more that we pretty much in the U.S. and in Canada, we had seen a slowdown.

I use the word, it because -- with the sells are still very strong and they're strong both in apparel and in home versus the as we moved into the last week of July in the first two weeks of August. The basket has remained strong or traffic is still up but -- the other thing I also would say is that as a reminder, the Q3 of FY'20 that we're reporting and going against also had a higher comp both in the overall third quarter than the second quarter and also was higher in the beginning of the third quarter as well. So that's probably a piece of that when you look at it on a two-year stack.

Q - Omar Saad{BIO 5302683 <GO>}
Thanks for the color, gentlemen. Thanks.

The final question of the day comes from Adrienne Yih. Your line is open.

Q - Adrienne Yih{BIO 5303791 <GO>}
Great. Thank you very much. Ernie, I agree with your comment toward the end of your prepared remarks about being set up extraordinary well for '22. One of my question for you is the inventory is always a topic and I know you guys talked about the availability of it. But if we straight look at the balance sheet inventory $5.1 billion now to $5.1 billion two-years ago on the Dublin [ph] and extra sales. How are you doing that? What is the efficiency that's gained there? Can you sustain that, because you're comfortable with that position?

And then my second question for -- my one question for Scott. What are we going to get back to that that 4% non-comp or new store growth, is that going to be next year? I'm sure you're working on your plans now. Thank you very much and great, great quarter.

A - Ernie L. Herrman{BIO 6943642 <GO>}
Yes. (multiple speakers) You have thrown up a loop Adrienne, usually I go first then he -- go ahead Scott.

A - Scott Goldenberg{BIO 21870549 <GO>}
(multiple speakers) Just to be clear on the inventory at the end of the second quarter was in the similar position on an average per store compared to '20, both quarters both in the stores. Overall on the DC, we had a lot of in-transit inventory at the end of the first quarter, a lot of in transit inventory at the end of the second quarter obviously, we didn't specifically say but we certainly have a lot on a quarter. As talk about our ability to availability has been great.

The inventory position like we said, compared to two years ago. We have less store inventory structurally -- the way the store is from a shop ability and all that, we have less fixtures and all that. Approximately 10% is just do at the store level due to that. We have, we're turning faster, almost one turn faster both in the first and second quarter due to having the lower inventory. It's paid dividends in terms of the mark-downs. We feel good about that. The other thing is part of it which is hard to we have less packaway inventory. So that's a bit of the piece of it in our DCs.

The last thing is, particularly in the first quarter and in the second quarter, the trends, we were buying to better trends, clearly, we saw the home trends were up, but the apparel trends have gone also up. We're chasing more than we typically would have been compared to two years ago.

A - Ernie L. Herrman{BIO 6943642 <GO>}
Adrienne, let me give you a little more color also on how it's made. Well, first, I'd like to do is give credit to our teams because they have really -- all the teams. When I say that the buyers, our logistics teams, our distribution services teams, the stores getting the goods out, so what we -- what we've done here is, every functional areas had to really execute a little differently and it varies by category, but I'm very proud of all of them because they've been -- as you alluded to, it's been a -- it's a strange market out there and the inventories are points in times have been up and down, but a couple of things that have been happening.

The buyers, when -- if they're in a category where things are, were things are a little light, they've been pulling the trigger a little sooner and buying with longer lead times than we typically would versus as there are out there, there are many categories that were extremely loaded and they'll buy it even closer hand-to-mouth. I really give them a lot of credit. The logistics teams have been securing the freight capacity we need to get the goods store DCs and stores to meet our strong demand and we're paying more when we need to do.

As always, and I know we talked to you and others about this. We do that because we think we will figure out as witnessed by what we're talking about today. We'll figure out later, how to offset the cost, but we want to continue to gain the market share and gain customers for the future. Again, the best thing for our business, for the next couple of years is to continue to grab this outpaced market share pace -- market share opportunity that we're on right now.

Here's the here's the ironic thing, I believe the disruption in the supply chain is going to create a future buying opportunity for us. So, when you look out at the end of this year, here's what I think. We've talked about these margin opportunities for next year, but we haven't factored in these lows are really more based on retail adjustments, average ticket going up -- what we're not factoring in is -- if the supply chain continues to be choppy, which it has been, we will be, this is going to be classic off-price textbook execution where there will be more uneasiness out there, which in my eyes, typically creates even more opportunity, buying opportunities.

So, in that case, we probably get the buy goods a little bit better. So then, you're getting it out of the cost and open your merchandize margin on the other side. I'm just kind of pretty excited about what's going on right now, on right now, but I'm glad you asked that, because it really is there's a lot going on, on that front right now in terms of inventory and supply chains et cetera.

Q - Adrienne Yih{BIO 5303791 <GO>}
Ernie, very well said, and it just underscores the flexing [ph] the model just tremendous. Great job and best of luck.
