Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
Thanks, Kevin, and thank you for joining KLA's earnings call today. KLA's March quarter results demonstrate continued momentum in our business. We delivered strong 27% year-over-year revenue growth, non-GAAP gross and operating profit rose 30% and 48% year-over-year respectively. And free cash flow grew 47% to a record level. We accomplished these by executing our strategic vision amidst a dynamic business environment.

Year-to-date, we've seen a sharp increase in business levels across each of our major markets. This is primarily due to the secular demand trends driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications such as 5G and cloud computing. Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to address these growth markets while continuing investment and leading-edge R&D efforts. Against this backdrop of strong demand, we continue to navigate evolving customer requirements and dynamic supply chain challenges. Still high level delivering on our commitments to partners, customers and shareholders, the impossible without the extraordinary contributions of our talented global teams who always rise to the challenges of meeting our customers needs in an increasingly complex global business environment.

Three key things enabled KLA's record results and momentum. One, successful innovation and market leadership. Two, the resourcefulness and talent of our global workforce and three, the strength in resiliency of the KLA operating model. Before we discuss this further, let me begin by touching on how we see the industry demand environment now. Strong secular demand trends continue to shape multiple markets and are fueled by the increasing digitization of end markets and industries.

In addition, there is a heightened focus on the strategic nature of our customers investments around both leading edge development, optimizing facility utilization and regionalization. As a result, our WFE forecast has improved even further from January reflecting the strength of demand we are experiencing over the past couple of months, with momentum continuing into calendar 2022.

In this environment KLA is experiencing a sharp increase in customer demand for systems and support for 2021 deliveries and our expectations for KLA revenue growth have increased from our initial assessment in January. This momentum in customer investment is happening against a backdrop, where process control intensity maintains its momentum and KLA continues to drive market leadership at levels approximately 4x the nearest competitor.

Propelled by the upside we're experiencing in the underlying WFE markets, KLA market leadership, increasing long-term process control intensity, our broader reach into electronics ecosystem and the contributions of our large and growing service business, KLA is on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of our original expectations.

KLA's market leadership results from the ongoing successful execution of fixing a high level of R&D to drive differentiation with a unique portfolio of products, technologies and (Technical Difficulty), we're pleased to continue to see the success of our efforts being validated by our customer's purchasing decisions.

There are some recent success stories to illustrate the point. The most recently published Gartner data shows that in 2020 the total optical inspection market grew at a rate, double that of the growth rate of the overall WFE market to approximately $1.9 billion with KLA maintaining our strong market leadership and 83% share of this critical market for process control.

Many already know the KLA is participating in the automotive electronics through our semiconductor packaging and PCB product lines. We're excited by near-term plans to launch new versions of our process control products, tailors the automotive industry. This quarter, expect to hear more about how KLA has positioned our wafer inspection portfolio to help customers drive higher reliability, quality and yield in automotive applications in both 200 millimeter and 300 millimeter production, which will help address some of the reported automotive semiconductor shortage just going forward.

Calendar year 2021 is positioned to be the sixth consecutive year of revenue growth for KLA, demonstrating strong through cycle growth, the success of our diversification strategies and our market leadership in process control and a large and growing contribution from our services business. Let's briefly cover the top five highlights from the March quarter results. First, we saw continued strength in breadth in foundry, logic demand in the quarter, as expected memory demand also grew as memory customers plan for growth in the equipment investment in 2021 to be improving end demand.

We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in March across major end markets. The strength in demand we are seeing reflects KLA's interest in future technology nodes. Second Gartner's recent market share reported for 2020 sized KLA's share of process control over 53% for the year. KLA's market share of process control has maintained a steady growth trajectory over the past 10 years.

Highlights of the 2020 Report show KLA continuing to strengthen our core franchise and optical inspection and strong momentum in gains, e-beam inspection and optical metrology, increasing investment in leading edge foundry, logic accelerated adoption of EUV continues to be major factors driving equipment spending. KLA's market leadership once again demonstrated in the success of our portfolio approach to solving complex customer requirements at the leading edge.

Third, our services revenue was $428 million in the March quarter or 24% of total sales, with over 75% of services revenue in our semiconductor process control segment resulting from recurring contract agreements. Services is on track for another strong double-digit growth here, driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group.

Our semi process control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the installed base, growing approximately 2.8 times faster over the last five years. Fourth, this was another growth quarter for Electronics Packaging and Components or EPC group highlighted by record quarterly bookings for the semiconductor -- the specialty semiconductor business. Growth was driven by automotive, 5G wireless connectivity and advanced packaging applications across various end markets.

With the EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broad product portfolio across fast growing new markets in the electronics value chain such as RF, automotive semiconductors and advanced packaging. As it relates to EPCs opportunities and advanced packaging markets, KLA is strengthening our engagement with the top 5 semiconductor market leaders in packaging and we're expanding our reach with those sets.

KLA is ramping our investment in advanced packaging market to drive adoption of new technologies in this exciting growth market in addition to new inspection products for high level production and assembly. Finally in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the March quarter, we repurchased $273 million of our common stock and paid $139 million in dividends, for a total capital return of $412 million or 71% of free cash flow of $585 million which was also a record.

Last July KLA's Board of Directors authorized the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since its inception in 2006 KLA's dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. We believe KLA's track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders.

Before Bren gets into greater details of our financial highlights, let me recap, KLA's March 2021 results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA's products and services and enabling the digital transformation of our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation.

KLA is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet the demanding customer requirements balancing sensitivity and throughput. Semiconductor and electronics landscape is constantly changing, we're seeing broadening customer interest driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge.

We believe there are multiple secular factors driving industry demand and KLA will continue to benefit from and position us to exceed our 2023 financial targets reached earlier than anticipated. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide robust cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to our shareholders.

And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren.

Bren Higgins{BIO 18108981 <GO>}
Thank you, Rick. Results this quarter highlighted the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation.

Total revenue in the March quarter was $1.8 billion at the top of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9%, above the midpoint of the guided range with stronger revenue and favorable product mix drove upside in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85 at the upper end of the guided range, GAAP EPS was $3.66.

Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $407 million including $239 million of R&D expense and a $168 million of SG&A. At KLA technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A and was $42 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense of technical applications represents about 70% and as a percentage of revenue it was very strong at 40.4%.

Given higher revenue expectations for the remaining three quarters of 2021 product development requirements, particularly in program supporting next generation reticle inspection capabilities, regionalization of additional customer engagement resources and increased investment in our infrastructure globally, particularly in expanding our manufacturing footprint and completing our new HQ2 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

We expect operating expenses to be approximately $412 million in the June quarter. We are budgeting quarterly operating expenses to increase sequentially $3 million to $5 million a quarter over the near-term horizon. Given top line expectations for 2021 and fueled by double-digit growth over the past two years, we expect that the business will continue to outperform our target operating model both in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage.

Non-GAAP net income was $598 million, GAAP net income was $567 million, cash flow from operations was $646 million and free cash flow was $585 million. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of over 32%. Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our semiconductor process control business, the EPC group delivered results mostly in line with our model heading into the quarter.

Revenue for the semiconductor process control segment, including its associated service business was $1.51 billion, sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 28% compared with March of last year. The approximate semiconductor customer mix was as follows. Foundry/logic was strong as expected at 69% and memory was 31%. In memory, the business was split, roughly 55% NAND and 45% DRAM.

Revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment in March was $92 million up 1% sequentially and up 8% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, power and advanced packaging. PCB Display and Component Inspection revenue was $205 million up 14% sequentially and up 28% year over year but mobility market is driving strength in advanced PCB and finished component inspection.

Revenue by major product category and region are both broken out in the shareholder letter and slides. From a balance sheet perspective, KLA ended the quarter with $2.4 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three agencies.

In terms of cash flow and capital returns, Rick already covered the highlights. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. While circumstances can change, our current expectation is that our capital returns profile for calendar '21 will exceed 85% of the expected free cash flow. As it relates to guidance, our overall semiconductor demand at WFE outlook is expanded further from our view in January. While we characterize the WFE market to grow in the low teens, plus or minus a few points, we are revising up our view for WFE market to grow on a percentage basis in the low to mid '20s, with a bias to the upside in calendar '21 from approximately $61 billion in 2020 reflecting the strengthening of demand we have experienced over the past couple of months across all segments.

Also at earnings in January, we provided a high level outlook of business levels being roughly flat quarter-to-quarter for calendar year '21. As we look ahead, based on the strength of our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters, along with expected product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenues to continue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year.

With the second half growing versus the first half, as more KLA manufacturing capacity comes online to support this robust customer demand environment. This growth is fueled principally by our semiconductor processor business. This business is positioned well in terms of expected performance in 2021 relative to the overall WFE market.

Our June quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.855 billion plus or minus $100 million, foundry/logic is forecasted to be about 68% and memory is expected to be approximately 32% of semi-process controlled systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix.

We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 63% as product mix expectations normalize in the June quarter. Based on increased revenue volume and product mix expectations for 2021, we are now modeling gross margin to be between 62% to 62.5% for the calendar year. While in any given quarter the mix of our business will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends both in terms of product cost and product positioning remain compelling in our sustainable tailwinds going forward.

Other model assumptions include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $412 million, interest and other expense of approximately $40 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.20 to $4.08 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $3.47 to $4.35.

The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $154.5 million shares. In closing, the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the strength of the leading indicators of our business and our customers multi-year plans for continued investment.

KLA is executing well and we have continued confidence that we are on track to both exceed our 2023 financial targets and achieve them sooner than anticipated on the strength of higher industry demand. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our strategic plans and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership deep competitive moat, strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders.

With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin?

Kevin Kessel{BIO 16743902 <GO>}
Thanks Bren. Priscilla, we're ready to queue for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) We'll now take our first question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.

Q - Krish Sankar{BIO 16151788 <GO>}
Hi, thank you taking my question and congrats on a really strong results. Rick or Bren, the first question I had was you're guiding to WFE, obviously uptick since three months ago somewhere in the mid 20 range. I'm kind of curious if I look at some of your peers, they're talking about 30% range, but either way from your vantage point, how do you think KLA if any process control revenues are going to do relative to your mid 20s WFE growth on a calendar '21 basis? And then I have a follow-up.

A - Bren Higgins{BIO 18108981 <GO>}
Hey Krish. Thanks for the comments. I'll start here, but you have to remember that everybody uses a different baseline. So that's why we put the baseline in there, so I said that against the baseline of 2020, at $61 billion we saw a -- we see growth from there in the low to mid 20s percentile and with bias to the upside. So I think that as we see it, you do the math on that puts you in that sort of $75 billion plus range of WFE and certainly, the momentum that we saw over the course of the quarter has increased pretty substantially, really across all segments.

So we feel, we feel pretty good not only about the growth of the overall industry, but the positioning of the semi process control segment against that industry growth expectation. So I think that it sets up well for us. We have to execute over the remainder of the year, but I think it sets up well for us in terms of relative performance against the industry.

Q - Krish Sankar{BIO 16151788 <GO>}
Got it, got it. Super helpful, Bren. And then, as a follow-up, and thanks for the color on the market share from last year, I'm just looking more if we look -- looking ahead, can you talk a little bit the market share dynamics and obviously a large US competitor has spoken about traction in process control, introducing new optical inspection tool with the e-beam combo along with AI?

So, I'm kind of curious, are you seeing the impact of your share, especially in foundry and logic? or how do you kind of contrive that especially given that you are obviously the leader in this space today?

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
Yeah, Krish. Thanks for the question. I think that there is no question that the demand for process control continues to be strong as Bren said. And we view process control in 2021 as outgrowing the overall market based on those drivers. From a competitive standpoint, we also expect to be able to continue the plan we laid out in 2019, which is to increase our overall position of process control as we have in the last couple of years and we think that continues, based on the strength of our product portfolio and the engagement we have with our existing customers.

There is no question that there is always going to be competition out there, but if you look at the history of the Gartner data, as we've highlighted, over time KLA has consistently been successful in leveraging our strategies to build on our market position and gain share and we don't see anything about the current competitive environment that will change that. We do have some major products to deliver in terms of -- in areas like reticle inspection, but -- and that's happening this year. But we're very pleased with the performance of our optical inspection and we're also very encouraged by the recent success of our e-beam offerings that we've really got back in those segments in the last year or so.

So, we feel good about our competitive position and as you might imagine, it kind of shows up in our gross margin in terms of the strength of our business and our competitive position that we're able to continue to have the kind of margin profile that we have despite the fact that we've added EPC which overall at a corporate level, you know was dilutive to the margins that KLA had prior to that. So I think that should be evidence of our strength.

Q - Krish Sankar{BIO 16151788 <GO>}
Got it. Very helpful, thank you, Rick.

Operator
And we will move next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.

Q - John Pitzer{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Yeah, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Bren, just first on the gross margin in the March quarter, what drove the upside. And I guess, importantly, as you look at June and full calendar year guide, what are the assumptions that you're making for kind of mix and to what extent are you above target because of cyclical -- because of mix or should we just start thinking about 62 plus is being cut of the new target?

A - Bren Higgins{BIO 18108981 <GO>}
Yeah, John, thanks for the question. So when you look back at the March quarter, most of the growth sequentially in the quarter came from the semi process control business and as Rick just mentioned, that's a richer business for us overall. So, that combined with the upside in the quarter in terms of incremental revenue is what drove the margins up to where they were. So a little bit lower as we look at June quarter, it is still in line with the kind of guidance that we've been providing at 62% plus or minus. So we're mostly in line with that as we look at quarter-to-quarter, we do have some sequential growth in EPC and so that's dilutive from that standpoint.

But in general, I think that the margin drivers structurally are all pretty solid. We're seeing nice leverage overall in the business from the activities, the strength of the business and the activities in our factory, so we're seeing good efficiencies. And then over the course of the year, I think just given directionally where it's moving, as I mentioned last quarter, I thought it was 61.5% to 62% for the year. Certainly the stronger outlook in terms of topline, but also just the drivers underneath in terms of what we're expecting from certain products. I think we're in line with that sort of 62% to 62.5% that I talked about in prepared remarks. And given the strength in the business overall probably more bias to the upper end of that range.

So I think that there is sustainable traction in these areas, particularly around certain products. We talked about the inflection in growth and optical inspection. So, anytime you see products like that inflecting that's going to drive to a richer mix overall for the -- for the overall business.

Q - John Pitzer{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
That's helpful. And then Rick as my follow-up. Going back to kind of the market share question which I think is one of the key investor concerns out there. I think the concern that some investors have is that as we hit this inflection from optical to more exotic light sources like e-beam and X-ray, there is sort of a view that the incumbency advantage kind of goes away and perhaps we're all kind of know estimating that inflection to happen more quickly than it will. Can you help me better understand the 4x market share advantage that you have in the optical world, how does that position you as we start moving to these new technologies?

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks John. I think the -- I'm not certain of this. But I think the fastest growing product in metrology and inspection are pretty certain was our Gen-5, over the last couple of years. And then the strength of that is driven by its ability to satisfy the needs that we have for inspection measurement with EUV.

So there is nothing that we're seeing that indicates the percent of inspection and metrology budget is dramatically increasing toward e-beam. In fact, if anything, it's always been the challenge to drive the optical at a higher rate, because the price performance is so much higher. I'd also say that the people that are closest to having a multi-beam e beam solution are KLA. We're the ones that have it that we're developing and introducing in the reticle space, which is I think where it's needed the most.

So, we don't really see any inflection, we don't see a change in the market share dynamic and if anything, the challenge that we're in and the operations team have is satisfying the increased demand around the optical portfolio that we have specifically GEN5 but also GEN4, which has slowed down, so I don't -- I don't buy the thesis that this is a transition. It hasn't been for years and the reason is because optical keeps getting better and it's really difficult to make an e-beam tool that is fast enough to satisfy most of the inspection requirements. In terms of pointing e-beam, pointing optical with e-beam that's not a new idea that's been around quite a while and KLA we introduced that concept when we introduced our e-beam inspection tool. I talked about it at our Analyst Day, that just allows those tools to be functional and it continues to provide value. So I don't think that transition is happening.

A - Bren Higgins{BIO 18108981 <GO>}
John, just to add to it. (Multiple Speakers) I think just in terms of overall growth rates, right. So we talked about the accelerated growth relative to market in 2020 and I would expect this business to grow faster in the market again in 2021. So I think that the good thing about the complementary nature of our e-beam solutions with our optical is driving higher relevancy in use case application across the optical inspection, which is the large market.

Right. That's the market that's $2 billion plus in terms of opportunities. So that will give you some perspective on the strategy overall, but there is an inflection here that's validating and I think the relevancy of optical inspection in a lot of different ways.

Q - John Pitzer{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
And Rick, is the incumbency advantage you enjoy in optical transferable as the world starts to move to e-beam?

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
Yeah it's John. I can, I don't think the world is going to move, large scale the e-beam. I mean, we're well positioned, if it does, but I just don't think that the -- I think there is going to be a mix and match in the percent of layers that could be inspected by e-beam has never going to be as high as what could be expected by optical. Especially since Gen 5 is still in the early iterations, we have more capability to add to Gen 5, we've been adding for a while added AI capability to that. So I think in general, yes, we have a good e-beam solution, but our modeling doesn't show that that's going to be the increased percentage of the use case because optical can satisfy especially Gen 5 and satisfy the needs that are going to be through the 2020 even past, when we get the high NA, EUV, and remember, that's only as a percentage of the layers that are going to be subject to that.

So I don't think we're going to see this transition to e-beam, I think incumbency for KLA has really been based on our ability to keep delivering new capability to the market, not so much because we've been there, but our newest products, which is why we invest so heavily in R&D and the application support for our customers.

So, I don't think it's going to transition, we'd be fine if it did, but I think it's a better price performance for our customers to have as many layers be done optically as possible because the throughput capabilities, just so much better and optical than it is in any form of view.

Q - John Pitzer{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Great color, thank you.

Operator
We will take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.

Q - C.J. Muse
Yeah, good afternoon and thank you for taking the question, I guess first question, Rick, I wanted to go back to your earlier comment around process control outgrowing WFE and to me logically when we're adding meaningful capacity, I would think process tools would outperform and process control would underperform. No, not any hint to you but just where you fit in terms of the order of spending. And here, you've outlined mid 20s kind of growth for the industry. Whereas we've heard 37% growth from (inaudible) we've got 30 plus percent growth of Lam. How in that world does process control outperform, is it Intel coming back, is it mask inspection spend from China, what are the moving parts like that can allow that to happen.

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
Yeah, I'll give some color and then Bren can fill in some of the details, but if you, if we assume the market is, let's say just pick it over 22% WFE growth this year. What we are loaded right now and what we're modeling that we need to do, just based on the orders and the conversations we're having with customers daily is we'll significantly outgrow that. I don't know, it will be 38% and it will probably start with a three. In terms of what it is now, we don't know what WFE is going to actually be this year, but if that's what process control -- that's just based on the conversations we're having right now. Ahmad Khan, who runs that business is in calls almost three times a week talking about slots and support for customers across the portfolio.

I get pulled in them occasionally, but that's the conversation, is how can we support that and when we model it, we look at that business and we think it's going to be very strong grower this year. Could the WFE numbers change, yes, of course, what's it driven on your other question, CJ. It's of course it's driven by the increased investment that people have in the AS design rules. It's not a secret that TSM has talked about (inaudible) publicly, but it's not just that, we're seeing increased commitment and conversation from the memory manufacturers who want that capability too.

So I think the difference between the process control intensity and foundry/logic is still there, but it is narrowing a bit as people push harder on the advanced nodes for specifically for the advanced DRAM work that's going, but also some NAND work too. Bren, maybe you can fill in.

A - Bren Higgins{BIO 18108981 <GO>}
Yeah C.J. I always struggle a little bit with these questions, just because everybody uses different baselines. I don't know what the baselines were for the different companies and sometimes you don't even share on, so you don't really know when you're thinking about percentages. So I tried to show our work here and let you know how we're thinking about it. If you look at 2020, KLA's performance was pretty much in line with the market, if you went to$52 billion to $53 billion in 2019 to 2020 at $61 billion, that's about 16% overall.

And if you look at semi PC equipment, it was in that ballpark. So as we look at this year, as I said earlier, if you're looking at $75 billion plus. I think that's where the industry is against the 61 baseline, then you're like in the mid 20s to our prepared remarks. And against that backdrop, I would expect process control to do very well, and so we'll see how it goes. I'm not going to guide the second half, certainly we would expect the second half to be stronger in that business overall.

And I think the drivers are pretty compelling and pretty broad based. So we'll see how it goes As we move forward here. But that's I think that's how I see it at this point.

Q - C.J. Muse
Very helpful, very helpful, as my follow-up, you alluded to supply constraints or adding on additional capacity. Would love to hear -- you guys typically run your business to roughly 7 backlog has that extended and I guess what, how should we be thinking about the timing of bringing on capacity implications to the model either gross margins or OpEx, if at all and if your lead times are extending beyond that kind of 7 months timeframe, do you have visibility now into the first half of 2022. Thank you.

A - Bren Higgins{BIO 18108981 <GO>}
Well, we prefer to operate right around six months where we can. Now our products do vary, some have very long lead times, where you're looking at some of our high-end systems, the timing to procure and optical components and the Polish and grind optics, it can take some time. So for some of those products that won't lead times are significantly longer. I'd say today if you aggregated across the company, we're a little bit longer than we'd like to be, so we'd like to target somewhere in that five to six and we'll probably somewhere in that seven to eight range as we look at it today and capacity is coming online, really across the board, we're adding people into all of our factories worldwide, we've been doing that since we started to see the business inflect in November in a meaningful way.

We're adding capacity in terms of space at all of our major factories around the world and we're working very closely with our suppliers. Suppliers have been great in supporting our ramp so far, they are adding and investing and we're investing in them in a lot of cases. So I would expect that given the guidance, the growth we're expecting in the second half will happen as a result of incremental capacity and we can continue to work that, so I think given the expectations around six months in terms of our lead time we can continue to add to what we have to support whatever environment we're facing.

At the end of the day KLA doesn't lose business because we can deliver, so we also will move things around as needed to be able to support our customers and we do a lot from a tactical point of view to try to shorten cycle times, adding shifts all the little things you can do to pull in and cut days out of out of a lead-time. So all those activities are ongoing and I think that as we execute against that into the second half, I think it creates opportunities for us to deliver to the expectation we have right now, but also to support upside if it presents itself.

Q - C.J. Muse
Thanks, Bren.

A - Bren Higgins{BIO 18108981 <GO>}
And I don't see any reason why it seems to be sustaining even as we move beyond right in terms of, I don't see anything falling off anytime soon.

We will take our next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open.

Q - Harlan Sur{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Hi, good afternoon. And great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. In foundry and most of the discussion has been focused on leading edge, but there is significant wafer tightness on lagging edge CMOS technologies 16, 28, 40 nanometer and higher. I know your sweet spot is advanced technologies, but there is some part of the demand strength in process control coming from these edge processes as capacity gets built out. So, what percentage of your business and process control is exposed to mature technology nodes.

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
So, in China all the business in China classifies as mature and most of that is pretty foundry weighted this year there is some wafer investment that's happening and there is some memory investment. But I'd still say it's probably greater than 60% to 65% foundry. I don't have a front of me. And so you've got that plus you've got other activity. I would say probably somewhere in the semi process control equipment, if I just look at the equipment part of the business, it's probably somewhere around 25% of our revenue. I would call 28 nanometer and above, 25% to 30%.

A - Bren Higgins{BIO 18108981 <GO>}
Yeah Harlan, just to add to it, it's not just tight there as you know it's tight everywhere and so you do remember years ago if you think back to when there was one product transition and the next product and (inaudible) reuse capabilities. That's really not an option now. And so when you get is that heavily utilization that benefits sales, but also we see that in service, that's what's part of what's driving the higher levels of our growth in service.

Q - Harlan Sur{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Great, good insights there and then as a follow on, I mean on the EPC business with again with the chip tightness on mature technologies, especially automotive and industrial focus and tightness in advanced packaging and substrates. I will assume that this would be driving strong demand for EPCs portfolio of products because they are focused on specialty processes, advanced packaging and PCB. And I think last call, I think your view was that ex-display that EPC would grow 15% this year, but just given the strong demand for analog, RF, power transistors, those have a new view of EPC growth for this year?

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
Yeah, we do, I think you hit it. And again, if you take out the Display piece, which has its own dynamics as you know, I'd say that we were being powered by and we talked about this in the past, Harlan, 5G largely if you think about it. Most of 2020 and early, now the thing that we have counted on early in terms of the deal thesis was automotive.

And as you know, and everybody knows they hit the brakes hard last year when the view of the overall economy was tough. Largely, I'd say that and some other factors have contributed to this chip shortage and so now they're back on, and you're right, that's definitely driving EPC, SPTS is being driven by that dynamic as well. So now it's really firing on all cylinders. And so we're seeing really, really strong growth across EPC in terms of supporting both the continued momentum in 5G, but also now automotive and I mentioned in my comments that we're going to talk more about some of the new offerings we're having to support our automotive customers, which we hope will not just help in terms of solving some of their problems, but alleviate some of these shortages as we help them with yield, which is really the near term the best leverage they have in terms of providing more output is higher yield.

A - Bren Higgins{BIO 18108981 <GO>}
Yeah Harlan. One of the things I'm encouraged by with everything that Rick said is including display now, I would say that our expectations about for EPC is in the mid teens. So that reflects some of the growth drivers and growth that we're seeing in the business that Rick mentioned. We'll see how it plays out half to half but I think it'll be reasonably balanced. We are doing ERP integration on one of those businesses and so that could drive some revenue across quarters a little bit as you prepare for that, but pretty consistent level of business and as I said, overall for the entire group growth expectations that are kind of mean 15 for the year. So we feel pretty good about where we're with those businesses and particularly on that growth. I think with all the synergy work we've been doing across the company in those -- in that group, really pleased with the operating leverage as well.

Q - Harlan Sur{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Great insights. Thank you.

Operator
And we'll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.

Q - Joe Moore{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Great, thank you. You mentioned China and the activity is mostly foundry. Can you give us an update on how big you see the China sovereign business. How much growth you see coming this year and how fragmented it is, how many different customers that you are seeing that are kind of spread out across that WFE?

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
It will probably grow mostly in line with the overall market I would think and very fragmented, lots of customers.

Q - Joe Moore{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay, great.

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
And also included in that, Joe -- Joe, also included in that is also some of the wafer activity that's happening where -- and mask where there is some investment in infrastructure to support the broader ecosystem.

Q - Joe Moore{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. And then as it pertains to regulation, whether it's the chips act or export controls reform that's kind of going through, I guess, do you feel like the equipment industry and KLA specifically has kind of a voice in the government in terms of the direction of these things and is, or is it kind of more dictated by the semiconductor customers. Just how big is the lobbying Kind of government affairs efforts from the equipment companies these days?

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
So, I think what's really happened is, there has been an openness in general to understand the dynamics. I think that a fear that many of us had was that there might have been unilateral action if you go back a year or so and it doesn't feel like there's going to be that now. It's going to be multilateral, it's going to be thoughtful and we're all in favor of free trade and nobody wants IP or other factors to be compromised. So I do feel like there is a constructive dialog around that and it's not just the semiconductor guys, it's also the equipment companies and we feel really good about where that conversation is.

Q - Joe Moore{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Great, thank you very much.

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
Thank you.

Operator
We'll move now to Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.

Q - Joe Quatrochi{BIO 18961101 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks for taking the question. On EUV, I was just curious, you talked a lot about process control intensity clearly benefiting from EUV, but I guess at three nanometer, we're starting to see a big step up in the number of EUV layers. Is that something we should think about it as maybe an incremental driver for you guys?

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
Yeah, Joe, for sure. I mean we're having. As you know, the development work. There's a lot of process control work that goes on early on what we're doing R&D and development for our customers and there is definitely an increased sensitivity to the number of layers that they have to (inaudible) drives multiple markets, but obviously ensuring the quality of the reticles and when they're printed the high quality is there. Now it's across more layers, so that drives adoption of GEN5, also just more sensitivity to smaller defects. So in general that shifts the dynamic if you thought about a blend between GEN4 and GEN5, which GEN4, is still very active as a product line. This will shift it more in those advanced nodes to a higher percentage of those tools being GEN5 tools and the next generation or iterations on GEN5, as we move forward.

I think we mentioned in the past GEN5 is very early in its product life cycle and there are a number of additional capabilities that will be added to it to support advanced. So those are just two areas, there'll be others in terms of the metrology challenges. But in general the process control challenges, as we move forward, especially on advanced design rules will increase and we're seeing that play out right now in development.

A - Bren Higgins{BIO 18108981 <GO>}
And Joe, one other factor to keep in mind that now you have these technical drivers and these node transitions that force customers to have to think about incremental capability and those requirements and so the ability to reuse, a lot of the capacity they might have purchased in a prior node is hard because you've got stronger end market adoption that's clearly happening today, particularly the 5-nanometer node but then also the technical drivers up even if they could use, the tool doesn't meet the technical requirements.

So that's another factor that drives intensity that that's pretty important to our overall business.

Q - Joe Quatrochi{BIO 18961101 <GO>}
That's helpful. And then maybe one for Bren, on the capacity increasing for your manufacturing footprint. I mean how do we think about your planning in terms of supporting overall WFE, because I think in the prepared remarks you talked about sustained growth looking even into next year?

A - Bren Higgins{BIO 18108981 <GO>}
Yeah Look, I don't think we're capacity constrained within the window that we talk about just in general that we think that we -- there is no upper limit right. We'll continue to work and we continue to invest. Certainly there is some time to some of the lead time on of parts, but whether it's facilities. We'd like to think about people parts of space of KLA are typically our long pulls around -- parts around some of the components we talked about.

So we're going to continue to add capacity and send strong signal into supply chain to drive the investments that are required and will -- based on customer readiness and customer expectations in 2021. So I'm really worried with the challenge to do this and we'll continue to make the investments that are required to get the capacity to support the environment we're in.

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
Thanks Joe.

Q - Joe Quatrochi{BIO 18961101 <GO>}
Perfect. Thank you.

Operator
And we will move next to Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open.

Q - Patrick Ho{BIO 5499707 <GO>}
Thank you very much and congrats. Rick, not to make you sad at all but you've been in this industry for a while. Given that you've seen previous cycles and how they've acted in terms of these first volumes where you've had to accelerate capacity, Bren just mentioned that he is not particularly worried about meeting customer demand.

But as we get into the secular change in terms of the industry where we may have sustained and elevated spending. How do you look at, I guess, meeting the challenges of supply, as well as meeting customer demand particularly for both for new tools for their needs. How do you manage potentially an extended period of spending at very elevated levels?

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
Thanks for not making me feel ill. Every cycle has I'm sure you've heard is different. One of the things that we learned early on is, is to look at the -- all of the money and figure out how profitable your customers are and what is sustainable and I go back to periods, where I remember companies that we're spending 2x their CapEx was twice the size of their revenue and I knew that couldn't last, right.

So when we look at the supply chain, now one of the leading indicators, we always look at is profitability of our customers and it's universally good. I mean there are some examples where customers are investing and we see this in China, where they don't have a revenue base to support the investment, but those are viewed as strategic investments, but the percent of that -- that's in the industry right now is really low, and so it's the growth of the semiconductor industry broadly, with all the different drivers.

The number of players that have maintained their profitability through these cycles and the fact that that gives us confidence in the sustainability. I don't think we're going to see growth rate, that's 25%, 30%. We're talking about what it might be this year. That's not going to be the long-term growth rate. I think there is a step-up to get to support these new drivers and I would imagine it resumes its growth at a more reasonable upper single digit kind of level for the equipment industry as we kind of model, but the step-up is consistent with the multiple drivers. As Bren mentioned, we have a lot of leverage in terms of being able to utilize our facilities, but even that, given that we're investing right now and to make sure we've got additional people, parts, and as Bren said, so that we could support the ramps that we're seeing.

I do think this is a step-up, I think we've seen it in the past and I think that the business is sustainable, I don't think 30% growth will happen for several years in a row. But if we did, we'd be there to support it. So we feel really good about where we are. And more importantly the investments we're making in our capability are the key to our continued success is to make sure we're staying relevant.

Q - Patrick Ho{BIO 5499707 <GO>}
And to make you feel younger, Rick, I'll ask you follow-up as well, as we look forward and I know process control does get, I guess, a good look at a lot of next-generation process technologies and manufacturing. You mentioned about EUV increasing layers in the adoption of GEN5. As you look forward to foundry/logic you have EUV increasing layers, but you also have in a few nodes, the transition to gate all around to nanowires, nanoribbon's. Qualitatively from a process control standpoint, I know it's very early, which do you see out of the EUV increasing layers and the transition to new transition structures, which do you see as a larger incremental opportunity for KLA?

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
Yeah, I think it's a great question: just so you know, we do have a group inside of KLA that models out the advanced technology designs. We have some really talented people that we think about that years in advance to think about what are the solutions that will be necessary. Gate-All-Around is an interesting one, because they are -- it's actually an adaptation of Gen 4 that's going to be most relevant to solving some of those problems based on the contrast of that those devices.

So we think that will be incremental. As I mentioned in the earlier question, if you think about more EUV layers that just drives the overall expectation of higher sensitivity across the portfolio. The increase for more, more inspection overall and at a higher level of sensitivity. I tip it towards the advanced nodes, driving more intensity than the new structures, but the new structures can be discounted because if we can't make them successful then you're not going to be able to ramp those -- there nodes. So, but I'd say probably 60-40 maybe even 65-35 that it will be the advanced design rules that drive it more, and it's not just going to be in foundry/logic, because we're also seeing even though it seems like they're always almost out of gas.

DRAM keeps pushing as well to drive the next capability improvements, so that they can have competitive advantage and I don't think that abates anytime soon.

Q - Patrick Ho{BIO 5499707 <GO>}
Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.

We will move next to Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open.

Q - Timothy Arcuri{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Hi, thanks. Thanks a lot. I guess I had the first question was on the whole e-beam versus optical thing. Applied launched the lighting tool in March and the idea that you combine optical and e-beam and you use inferencing to sort of determine what defects matter. You guys talked about that a lot back in the back half of 2019 with the eSL10. So I guess conceptually, it's not new, but they have a pretty strong e-beam review presence.

So I guess in theory that could provide kind of a better input for the AI algorithm. But can you sort of talk about just this general idea and maybe sort of whether it can change the impact the e-beam could have on the market and your position?

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
Yeah. Tim, thank you for remembering what we said in 2019, I could go back even further when we introduced that same spec back years and years ago and the idea, it was a pointer for optical back then. And that was in the '90s. So this idea of e-beam directing optical is an old idea. The idea that -- the problem that it has in general and this is interesting question is do you have systemic defects, can you really can you actually point that, AI has helped solve some of those problems, but there is still this basic question about coverage and can you cover enough of the wafers to see enough of the errors. If you look at modern wafer in a leading fab, they don't -- how many defects. I mean there are very few. So you need to cover a lot of area and that's what optical is really good at.

The e-beam ends up being the most valuable in debugging of a new process at the very front-end, which is why it's mostly been in R&D, and that's what we're continuing to see. AI has been added to the products we've been doing that for a number of years, whatever your definition is, increasing the intelligence, the algorithm that's been KLA's sweet spot for years and we continue to do that. So I don't think that -- I don't think that the announcement of 2-1/2 year-old technology earlier this year was really anything revolutionary other than kind of an announcement.

It's not new. And I don't think that the relevancy of what we're doing changes as ML and the AI across all the products for KLA and others as well. So I think that's an area we're all taking advantage of and that will help increase the capability in the learning that the industry has in general to be able to move forward, but I don't -- this was not in just location, that was not anything new for customers, it might have been new for other communities, but the disclosures in the conversations are not due to customers.

Q - Timothy Arcuri{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Thanks, Rick. And then I guess just last, but I think for me, so service, obviously it's a lower portion of your total rather than your peers. I know that you're never going to be like films guys given the nature of their technology some of their tools eat themselves. So obviously it's sort of like apples and oranges there, but some of them also were sort of guaranteeing performance and metrics like that and they're sort of selling that and I'm wondering what sort of new things you're bringing to bear in service to maybe help your service business start to grow a little faster? Thanks.

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
Yeah, Tim, I mean we -- I think one of the things and service for us is that we have the ability to really customize our offerings for customers, both in terms of response times, in terms of stocking levels, in terms of uptime commitments and things like that and then given that and given the nature of the contract that we structure and it's pretty important for bringing customers buy process control.

They buy what they need and then have contracts to ensure that the tools are running full out all the time and they are willing to invest in a contract structure to ensure that we can keep them up and make sure that they match and all those sorts of things. So it's a little bit different business, customers because they don't have as many they have 10s instead of 100s, as they were in a process tool. They don't necessarily have the ability to build the capability, internally to be able to do self-service and so that's a unique aspect of our service business.

There is also the complexity of what we offer relative to process tools, which is far different. So for all those reasons, it does drive a different service experience for customers and as I said we customized to meet their operating expense requirements and what they are looking to get out of their fab and it does drive this 75% plus contract revenue stream.

I think there is always what happens with the new tools in terms of our ability to sell and support services on new tools, I think, where we've seen a lot more engagement with customers and the trailing edge where you're seeing higher reliability and quality requirements particularly let's say for example, in areas like automotive or customers weren't as focused on the process control outcomes as much as they are today with the growth that we're seeing in the increase in reliability that's required and given the margin structure in that industry for example. It's pretty important that you don't underkill, right because of the cost of recall and so on but then there's also overkill too. So there's a lot more process control engagement that's happening through our service business with those customers to support the installed base at a greater level. So you don't see tools falling off, you've seen them seen in service and that's what is probably the unique growth driver that we're seeing today as products are living longer and some of these other markets are inflecting.

Q - Timothy Arcuri{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Thanks.

And we have time for one more question. We'll take our final question today from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.

A - Vivek Arya{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question. You will be at your 2023 target model this year basically two years ahead, but that seems to have been driven a lot more by market growth rather than I think in your target model you had penciled in one to two points of share gains. And I know, Rick, you highlighted a third party survey that had your share kind of slipping a little bit last year. I'm just curious, when do you think we should start expecting share gains for you over the next few years. And will that be driven by the launch of new products or will that be driven by share in a like to like category, will that be driven by spending being more foundry/logic based, just how do we think about what you had thought about share gains at the Analyst Day versus what you have seen so far and how we should think about this share shift over the next one to two years.

A - Rick Wallace{BIO 3540990 <GO>}
Yeah, I'll take the first part and let Bren talked up model. We actually are ahead of our share projections that we laid out in the Analyst Day 2019, we gained 3.3% share and that got 0.7 down is what the surveys but we had modeled 2.5% over the four years and we've gained 2.3% over two years and we believe that this year will be another strong year. So, I mean these things move annually. It's kind of hard because there are puts and takes. But competitively, we're actually ahead of plan and largely that's driven by the success mainly of Gen5 and what we're seeing in the optical inspection portfolio that's been the bigger gains.

We have new products coming out that will add to that, but our expectation of share growth is actually higher than it was at the time when we did the analyst meeting, based on the success that we've had to date and then Bren can talk more about.

A - Bren Higgins{BIO 18108981 <GO>}
Yeah, from a top line point of view, you're right, it's been what's driven it mostly has been, yes, we had some incremental share improvement relative to the plan we were on, but just stronger industry growth. We talked a lot in part of our theme was if you will, back for our Investor Day was to talk a lot about opportunities related to EUV and increasing memory opportunities, to drive incremental adoption of process control and KLA solutions.

We talked about reticle inspection requirements for EUV that would affect that reticle inspection tools, but also the wafer inspection tools. We also talked about new markets like e-beam that we were re entering and then finally opportunities and memory metrology. So those, in some ways we're going to create incremental revenue almost irrespective of the WFE level.

If we look at where we are today, most of it's been industry growth in the, I'll call it the normal products or the regular products and share opportunity has driven our performance relative to the overall plant. The contributions from those products are still to come, we talked a lot about '20 and '21 being opportunities to engage with customers to see the markets and that we would start to see more steady state contributions in 2023 from those products.

So we're still in that same page regarding those and in some cases COVID has made it a little bit harder to engage with customers out in the field to support new products and to drive new markets, but I think that's still to come. So we've got a higher industry environment that's driven us to where we are today, but those contributions are still to come in over the next couple of years and so we're excited about that. And then on the leverage part, anytime you have revenue that's grown, what we saw in '20 -- in calendar '20 where we are up 15% as a company and the growth expectations we now have for 2021 given the industry commentary earlier. Anytime you drive revenue like that you're going to drive more leverage through the model. So yeah, we're outperforming our public model by about 4 points in operating margin today, do I think that that's sustainable at four points, probably not, but do I think there's a couple of points for sure sustainability there, I do just given the strength of the products and the expected mix going forward.

So yeah, we're -- I think in a pretty good place relative to the overall model, we have to execute of course over the next year or so and we'll have more to say about the future in the coming months and quarters.

A - Vivek Arya{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
If I can squeeze in a quick one, automotive from your perspective, when do you think the automotive industry is able to address all these supply shortages that it's seeing from the semiconductors?

A - Bren Higgins{BIO 18108981 <GO>}
I think we're not the right people to answer that question. We're going to do everything we can to help them, but it's hard to understand exactly how they got so out of line with the demand, but I know that there have been contributing factors, and you've heard of, some of them projects that were started fires that happened and the reluctance to invest earlier than retrospect was needed plus a strong demand. So we're going to do everything we can to help them, but you are the best people ask for that.
