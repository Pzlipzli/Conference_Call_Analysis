Presentation
Operator
Good morning, my name is Sarah, and I will be your conference facilitator for today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.

Roderick Green{BIO 22231050 <GO>}
Thank you, Sarah. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website.

Before we begin please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statements on Slide 2. I will now turn it over to Mike.

Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Thank you, Roderick, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We continue to see a challenging and dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Current events highlight the importance of balancing economic prosperity, energy security, and environmental protection. In line with these three imperatives, Chevron remains focused on our objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon. During the third quarter, we continued to make progress by delivering a return on capital employed in the mid-20s, returning more than $5 billion to shareholders for the second quarter in a row, and investing to grow both our traditional and new energy businesses.

Earlier this week we released our methane report with specific disclosures about our aim to be a leader in methane emissions, management. Our goal is simple, methane in the pipe. I encourage you to read our report available on chevron.com. Our strategy remains clear and consistent. Our results keep getting better. While future market conditions are uncertain we're well-positioned to deliver value to our shareholders in any environment.

With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre.

Pierre R. Breber{BIO 18332161 <GO>}
Thanks, Mike. Third quarter financial results were strong. Included in the quarter were $177 million of pension settlement costs and positive foreign currency exchange effects of $624 million. The appendix of this presentation contains a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. We repurchased shares at the high-end of our guidance range and ended the quarter with a net debt ratio under 5%. Cash CapEx was $3 billion, up over 50% from last year. For the sixth consecutive quarter, Chevron's free cash flow exceeded $5 billion. We're on track to be 2021's free cash flow record. Adjusted third quarter earnings were up more than $5 billion versus last year. Adjusted Upstream earnings increased mainly on higher realizations, partially offset by inventory timing impacts.

In other, tax benefits are more than offset by higher operating expenses and other costs. Adjusted Downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining margins and favorable inventory timing impact. The planned turnaround at our Richmond Refinery was a driver of higher OpEx and lower volumes for the period. In other, lower chemicals earnings were partly offset by higher trading gains. Compared with last quarter adjusted earnings were down modestly. Adjusted Upstream earnings increased primarily on higher liftings and tax benefits partially offset by higher charges for abandonment accruals and exploration leases.

Adjusted Downstream earnings decreased primarily on lower refining margins and lower volumes and higher OpEx due to the Richmond plant turnaround partially offsetting is a favorable swing and timing effects. Third quarter oil equivalent production was flat compared to a year ago. Growth in the Permian along with the absence of turnarounds and Hurricane Ida impacts were offset by the expiration of our contracts in Thailand and Indonesia and the sale of our Eagle Ford assets.

Now looking ahead, in the fourth quarter we expect a modest turnaround. After producing a record number of LNG cargoes in the third quarter we expect fewer spot cargos out of Australia due to maintenance and summer temperatures. In the third quarter, we received a dividend from Angola LNG. In the fourth quarter, we expect dividends from TCO and Angola LNG and we expect to end 2022 at the top-end of our full-year guidance for affiliate dividends.

As a reminder, Chevron pays a 15% withholding tax on TCL dividends that lowers earnings and cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we will pay over $700 million associated with the early termination of a long-term LNG re-gas contract at Sabine Pass. This payment was accrued previously through working capital. Also, we expect to buyback shares at the top-end of our guidance range.

In closing the third quarter showed again how Chevron's higher returns, lower carbon objective creates value for all of our stakeholders. Back to you, Roderick.

Roderick Green{BIO 22231050 <GO>}
That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow. We will do our best to get all your questions answered. Sarah, please open the lines.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Good morning, Jeanine.

Operator
Jeanine, your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Jeanine Wai{BIO 16974257 <GO>}
Hello.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Jeanine?

Q - Jeanine Wai{BIO 16974257 <GO>}
Yes, can you hear me now?

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
I can. Yeah. Go ahead.

Q - Jeanine Wai{BIO 16974257 <GO>}
Okay, perfect. Sorry about that. In case you think I have that right by now. Well, good morning, again thank you for taking our questions. My first question is on US production growth. So either Mike or Pierre, the Permian was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter averaged a little under 700,000 a day so far this year. Given the industry dynamics and supply-chain challenges can you provide an update on how operations are going and I guess what we notice is that with only one quarter left in the -- left for the year it looks like you'll be closer to the lower-end of the 700,000 to 750,000 guidance range and so we're just wondering if that's by design or if there's external factors driving that because we also noticed this morning one of your integrated peers in the Permian lower their '22 growth expectations?

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Yeah, Jeanine my never say year-to-date Permian production was a little over 700,000 barrels a day, up about 15% from the first three quarters of last year, which was just a touch over 600, so we're seeing good growth. And for the quarter itself, production was up about 10% at 780,000 barrels a day versus 646 in the same quarter last year. I think the thing that some people may miss is during the pandemic drilled but uncompleted well inventories really grew, and rightfully so we didn't need to frank wells and bring them on online when there was declining demand for the production, aand we have some drilling going. So that inventory grew.

As we went back to work the first thing we did was send completion crews out and started to bring the DUC online and you saw that through the back half of last year. And certainly, the first part of this year which may have misled a little bit in terms of the rate of growth because this was this kind of surge capacity, we're back to factory drilling now our DUC inventory is kind of in-line with what our plan would suggest it would be and so we're seeing production level out at a growth rate that is more of the kind of underlying rates that you should see. So we likely will be towards the lower end of the range. We get some non-ratable bookings from our non-operated joint ventures. We give you a range because we expect to be in the range but we don't always hit the high-end of the range so, in this case, we will be towards the lower end but we're not changing guidance for this year, or our forward guidance.

A - Pierre R. Breber{BIO 18332161 <GO>}
And Jeanine I'll just add that low end of the range represents 15% year-on-year growth. So that's very strong growth.

Q - Jeanine Wai{BIO 16974257 <GO>}
Great. Thank you for that clarification. Maybe, Pierre just sticking with you here. In terms of your comments earlier this morning, I think I caught it in an article that '23 CapEx would be at the top-end of the 15 and 17 plan medium-term guidance range. We know there's a lot of moving pieces and I don't know if you're going to talk about this because you visit it in a month or so but the most obvious moving pieces that we see next year are that TCO spend is starting to roll-off and some of that will be absorbed by the Permian which we know is going to garner some more capital next year. So our question is, is capital trending to the higher end of that range, is that more of a reflection of Chevron responding to the macro-environment, or was that always part of the plan and, maybe just some inflation is pushing the capital a little higher? Thank you.

A - Pierre R. Breber{BIO 18332161 <GO>}
It was always part of the plan for us to increase investment coming out of COVID as Mike just spoke about. We're in the final stages of approving our business plan and our capital budget and as you said will announce that in December. You should expect it to be near the top-end of the range again consistent with what our plans have been. We are going to increase in the Permian and in other locations. We do have some cost inflation that is also will contribute to that and we will share all those details when we announce in December and that's about a 20% increase and next year relative to where we think we'll end up this year so year-to-date we're a little bit below our capital budget on an organic basis, and so that will result in about a 20% increase, which is very again in line with our guidance and consistent with increasing investment and growing energy supplies.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Thanks, Jeanine.

Operator
And our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Neil Mehta{BIO 16213187 <GO>}
Good morning Mike, Pierre, team, thank you. The first question was around Kazakhstan and Mike would just love your perspective on how you're viewing the assets out there, both the development of Tengiz and then as you think through vacating barrels at the CPC pipeline.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Sure. So I'll start with the project. We're on track to complete bulk construction by the end of this year. No change to our cost or schedule guidance we're 97% complete on construction right now. There's still a lot of work to be done but the risk and uncertainty are certainly narrowing and the remaining risks tend to be smaller in scale and potential impact. So we're moving into commissioning systems, testing, and startup activities. We built a new integrated operations control center that I've visited, which is fully operational with systems online. Our drilling program is complete, the final metering station is online. So very good progress on the construction side and, we'll continue to update you as we progress toward WPMP, the pressure management startup indicated right now for second half of 2023, and then the future growth project in '24.

On the CPC and the pipeline, there are no constraints on our ability to move barrels on that line. We've slowed everything out that we've been producing and, you've probably seen the media reports that a couple of the single-point moorings are offline right now for some repairs to the buoyancy system, those repairs are underway and expected to be completed shortly. So at this point, everything flowing and it looks like, we'll continue to do so.

Q - Neil Mehta{BIO 16213187 <GO>}
Thanks, Mike. And Mike you spent many years as a downstreamer as well and have a great perspective on the global refining system. I don't think I ever thought that just the cracks would be up here. Pierre, love your perspective on where we are in terms of the refining market, how do we work our way through the bottlenecks that seem to be existing in the system, and what that means for your Downstream business.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Sure. Yeah, it's been an interesting couple of years in the refining sector, Neil. With COVID we actually saw through that period of time some refineries shut down around the world that maybe at a rate greater than we would have expected before as the economics really collapsed as demand collapsed. There were some refineries in the US that have been taken offline after storm damage or operating incidents that are not coming back. We see others being converted to renewable diesel and so you had a constraint or reduction in refining capacity that occurred over the last couple of years in a way we really haven't seen previously.

And the other thing that happened is some of the new-builds that are in various stages of development, primarily in the Middle East or Asia slowed down during COVID and a lot of the industry slowed activity until we had a better view on how we are going to come through that period of time. I think those will come back into development and eventually online, which will ease some of these global constraints but the systems are tight right now, and what you see is when you have some maintenance that runs along, some unplanned events as we've seen on the West Coast or when you see things like the strike that we've seen in France here recently markets tighten up really quickly and that sends a price signal to try to bring supplies in from further away and so the entire refining complex right now is a little more tightly balanced than it historically has been and I think in the short term if you want to call that the next year plus or minus, probably stays that way maybe a little bit longer to some degree and then I think as you see some of this new capacity come online, we get back into a situation where it's not quite as finely balanced as it is today but no doubt we're in a market that we really haven't seen probably in my career in terms of the overall tightness on supply and demand.

Q - Neil Mehta{BIO 16213187 <GO>}
Excellent.

And our next question will come from John Boyle with JPMorgan.

Q - John Royall{BIO 17723205 <GO>}
Hey, guys, good morning, thanks for taking my question.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Good morning, John.

Q - John Royall{BIO 17723205 <GO>}
Just thinking about your buyback range $5 to $15 billion. 3Q was a strong quarter from a fundamental perspective but maybe feels more repeatable to me as an upside case in 2Q did. In 3Q you still generated free cash flow well in excess of both your dividend and the buyback at the top-end of the range. So my question is do you think you could go further than the $15 billion at the top-end given you still have a good amount of deleveraging happening at this point in the cycle there doesn't seem quite as extraordinary as 2Q did?

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Yeah John we've actually increased our rate of buybacks three times this year. We announced the first one at the end of last year, but we've we have steadily moved the range up and the rate of re-purchases up and so we're at an all-time high in terms of the rate of share repurchases and you're right we've got strong cash flow right now, which allows us to support all of our financial priorities and maintain a strong balance sheet. I think the thing I just would reemphasize is we want to maintain the buyback program throughout the cycle and we're not pro-cyclical, we're not countercyclical, we want to operate across the cycle, so our shareholders see consistency out of us in, and that they can count on that. And so we're positioned in a way where we're confident we can maintain that and we regularly reassess it is our view as our business and commodity markets continue to evolve and so we'll continue to do that in a price you of anything further. Pierre do you want to add anything to that?

A - Pierre R. Breber{BIO 18332161 <GO>}
I'll just point out that we increased our dividend 6% earlier this year, we've been growing our dividend at a compounded annual growth rate of 6% for 15 years and that is our first financial priority. So there's a lot of attention on the buyback but it's clear our fourth priority after sustaining and growing the dividend, investing to grow both traditional and new energy businesses, maintaining a strong balance sheet and as Mike said we intend to do it across the cycle for multiple years.

Q - John Royall{BIO 17723205 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. And then just looking at your bridge for International Upstream and I think Pierre may have mentioned in his remarks as well. You have this tailwind, about $300 million from tax. Is that an impact from country mix or are there other moving pieces we should think about there and should we think about this as sustainable?

A - Pierre R. Breber{BIO 18332161 <GO>}
In terms of International Upstream, the benefit in the third quarter is primarily around record LNG cargoes out of Australia, I think Gorgon and Wheatstone, so we're, very happy to see that was a time when the world needed the energy and again a lot of that is under long-term contracts, but that included cargoes in the spot market which we know are at high prices. So we signaled that we expect fewer LNG cargoes in the fourth quarter because during the summer temperatures in in the Southern Hemisphere it's just how you just produce less and then we do have a pit stop that is planned for one of our facilities. In terms of tax items those are items that can be one-time in nature and so I would not look for those to be necessarily repeating.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Thank you, John.

Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.

Q - Roger Read{BIO 6161944 <GO>}
Yeah good morning.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Hi, Roger.

Q - Roger Read{BIO 6161944 <GO>}
Maybe, just to ask a question that kind of ties a little bit into the question on the Permian and maybe as you said lower-end and the non-op portion, and the CapEx discussion but just a broad question on inflation and not just inflation and the price sense, but some of the productivity challenges that come when you start getting busier. I mean, you've got, it's a global footprint as anybody in. I'm just curious how you would characterize that as you look across and is there, is it becoming more challenging to mitigate some of those issues?

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Yeah, Roger the, I'd like to tell people we plan our work and work our plan and so we've indicated for frankly if you go back to the pre-COVID trajectory that we pretty much have stayed right on even with the interruption of COVID. And so in terms of contracting for rigs, completion crews, pipe sand you name it, we tend to have a longer-term visibility into that we commit to our service providers earlier and that can result in both quality and availability of people, equipment, et cetera.

So we don't see any meaningful constraints on our ability to execute our program. Certainly, we are seeing some cost inflation and the Permian is probably the strongest that we see around the world kind of into the low-double-digits, year-on-year.

In other parts of our portfolio, the cost pressures are probably a little bit less and the constraints aren't quite as pressing. So I think you'll see a little bit of that in our capital guidance as it comes out, as we wrap up our planning and we look to next year. And I do think that it is probably it's very real, and what we call the Governor but a constraint on the industry, the pace of industry activity and ramp-up as you know as we get into the next year you hear other people talking about it from their point of view and, I'll let them comment. And yeah it's very real and we've seen this movie before in the Permian, we've seen it up in the oil sands a decade earlier and in a cyclical business, this is a part of it.

Q - Roger Read{BIO 6161944 <GO>}
Yeah, for sure. Follow-up question, renewable natural gas, RNG we saw a big acquisition announced here a few weeks ago on that front, you've been one of the leaders said. I was just curious as you look at, what's been going on in terms some of the legislation that's come out federally as well as just the extent of the impact of the LCFS in California. if any updates we should think about in the RNG business. One of the things mentioned in that acquisition was the position that the company already had in terms of I guess you'd call leasehold right on landfills and stuff. Just characterize kind of where you are relative to where you, want to be and where maybe this competitor is setting up.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Sure. We feel very good about where we are. We're a leader in RNG leveraging strength across the entire value chain from feedstock to customer. We've been a partner of choice for a lot of the dairy farmers. We've got a strong brand to pull through. We've got a really strong market position in California where the LCFS provides the strongest incentives for this. So we like the position that we've built up. We've got. 75 CNG sites online or in progress right now through the retail side. So our efforts, we are an early-mover and we've preferentially focused on dairy as opposed to landfill gas.

So there certainly are others that are active in this area, I don't want to comment on how somebody else looks at things. I would just say our business is up and running and we're supplying customers today, not kind of planning out into the future and kind of banking on that. I mean we intend to grow it further but it's a real business for us today and it's performing well.

Q - Roger Read{BIO 6161944 <GO>}
Great, thank you.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Thanks, Roger.

And our next question will come from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.

Q - Devin McDermott{BIO 19137879 <GO>}
Hey, good morning, thanks for taking my questions.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Good morning, Devin.

Q - Devin McDermott{BIO 19137879 <GO>}
So I wanted to stick with new energies first and a few weeks ago there was the announcement that you joined a consortium to look at hydrogen and ammonia project on the Gulf Coast. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more detail around that and then more broadly with the Inflation Reduction Act passage, how you're thinking about the opportunity set in new energies platform over the next few years?

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Sure, yes. We're excited about the announcement to work with a number of really good partners to try to develop the hydrogen opportunities there on the Gulf Coast. One of the things, I think you're going to see in these new energy businesses as they evolve is going to have to build entire new value chains. And that means we're going to partner with different people who have expertise in different parts of these value chains and can bring technology, can bring customers, can bring experience to venture that no one company necessarily would have all of that but collectively we can work with people that can build these new value chains. And so it's early days on many of these things. We're studying all the different opportunities in terms of blue hydrogen, green hydrogen, there's a lot of different colors that are possible as you get down into the details of it and it will require significant investments.

So I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here this is to really develop a well-informed perspective on the investment opportunities the business models and ultimately how we would build the business up there but it's exciting they're high-quality partners that we are working with and I think you'll see more of these efforts announced here, we've got a lot of them that we're working on around the world, not just here in the US.

Q - Devin McDermott{BIO 19137879 <GO>}
Great, thanks so much. Look forward to seeing the additional details there over time. My second question is actually on M&A and just consolidation and if you think back over the last few years you've had a great track record, the Noble deal in 2020; Reggie, more recently, I'm wondering if you talk a little bit more about how you're viewing the landscape for further acquisitions Upstream, Downstream, and even new energy going forward.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Sure, Devin. So we're always looking. We've got an evergreen process where we scan all the different sectors that are of interest to us. And so we watch companies, we watch sectors, we watch opportunities but we've had a pretty high bar, which is, why, we've only done a few deals, and as you say we feel like the deals we've done are likely to turn up well. We've got a strong portfolio. We've got a really strong base case and so we, don't need to do a deal unless it really improved on what we expect to deliver otherwise. So, I would just say we're going to continue to be very disciplined, we don't have an open checkbook, even when times are good like this especially when times are good like this. We walked away from a deal a few years ago, rather than chase value out of it. We've sold assets out of our portfolio well-timed and as you say the last couple of deals were done at a pretty good time.

So over time, I think in the oil and gas business there's likely to be some more consolidation. You need fewer and stronger companies that normally happens at the bottom of the cycle rather than at the top of the cycle. In new energies, there's a lot of activity to Devon's question and I think there is a very active market out there where you could see some things come together because nobody has all the pieces and I think as you look at building these businesses, we're going to find combinations probably are necessary to actually beginning to put those pieces together, but we're going to be disciplined as we have been all along and if we do anything, we'll come out to explain to you how it's going to create value for shareholders.

Q - Devin McDermott{BIO 19137879 <GO>}
Great, thank you.

Our next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.

Q - Doug Leggate{BIO 1842815 <GO>}
Well, thanks. Good morning, everyone.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Good morning, Doug.

A - Pierre R. Breber{BIO 18332161 <GO>}
Good morning.

Q - Doug Leggate{BIO 1842815 <GO>}
Mike or Pierre, maybe I've got one for each of you guys. Maybe, I will go to Pierre, first. So. yeah. I think you've been, both of you guys have been very clear about managing the buyback through the cycle and I think we'd probably agree that your breakeven is not one of the best in the industry but you still end up building a ton of cash and your share price is at I guess pretty close to an all-time high. So, I'm just curious about the last thing you had in this situation you had multiple parallel projects going on to manage almost close to net debt, and balance sheet. What's to prevent you from building cash on the balance sheet and being opportunistic whether it be through M&A, whether it'd be a cyclical opportunity to buy back your shares at a lower level, I'm just curious how you, think about that.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
We've had a philosophy that goes back a long-time and a track record again I think that speaks for itself, 35 years of dividend increases again compounding at 6% for the last 15 years. Our investments in our traditional new energy growth both our guidance on Upstream production growth is 3% compounded we're now the second largest bio-renewable diesel producer in the country with our Reggie acquisition. And when we generate cash in excess of that it first goes to the balance sheet. so we've been very clear that our stated net debt ratio is between 20% to 25%, that's still a very strong balance sheet.

If you recall as we entered COVID. we were the only company that showed a stress test at $30 brand and our net debt ratio was going to go into the low 30, if, in fact, we would have had two years at 30 but that would have been where many of our peers started into COVID. So we've always maintained a strong balance sheet and we think that's appropriate over the cycle to be in that range but we're well below that. Our net debt is under 5%, so that's just a function of cash coming in and out, just commitment to not be pro-cyclical we could have a larger buyback program today, absolutely if we wanted to just peg our net debt ratio at a higher level but I think our shareholders would appropriately question that strategy has not being across the cycles. So we are setting the buyback at a level that allows us to maintain it across the cycle when prices do correct, we'll continue to buyback shares near the top-end of the range that we've been talking about.

In terms of acting countercyclical, in terms of M&A or any kind of major capital projects we have the capacity to do that at all kinds of balance sheet. We've shown that. On M&A, we use equity because we think it makes a lot of sense. There is oil price risk in any kind of transaction. So we don't need to do it all with cash. Still it will come with debt very likely so we want to have some capacity but using equity in oil deals makes a lot of sense.

And again we have a great portfolio of projects but we've shown a 10-year profile in addition to our five-Year guidance, where the growth continues. We have a lot of great projects to choose from. The goal here is to sustain and grow the enterprise for the lowest capital possible. We're more capital and cost-efficient than we've ever been. We've talked about that and we're not really paid for growth by the market. So we are growing at very appropriate rates, strong rates for the next five years and again we've shown beyond that but we certainly have the balance sheet and the capability to do more if we think again as Mike said it's in the interest of our shareholders.

Q - Doug Leggate{BIO 1842815 <GO>}
Very thorough answer. Thank you, Pierre, for that. Mike, I hit the spot but you hold the privilege or the challenge I guess of messing with administration recently. I asked this question to your larger peer earlier today, I'm just curious if you care to share your thoughts on some of the legislative, potential legislative risks that might face the industry and I guess at a big picture level, I'm curious whether you feel that the ESG pendulum from investments, investor standpoint is beginning to swing back in your favor. Just any thoughts you care to share on that?

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Sure, Doug. So look when we meet with policymakers including those in the administration. What I talk about is the importance of energy in balancing economic prosperity, energy security, and environmental protection, and, all three of those things matter. Economic prosperity is affordable energy underpins the ability of the economics or economies to thrive, reliable energy is tied to national security and we're seeing that play out in different parts of the world today, and then, of course, there the concerns about the environmental impacts of energy production and energy use and we have to take those very seriously as well.

And so my message to the policymakers is to be sure that we consider the appropriate balance of all three of those in policy because if you over-index on just one, you can create unintended consequences and vulnerabilities that may not manifest themselves for a little while but they're there and eventually, they do materialize. And so I'm a believer that we share a lot of common ground with governments around the world as we talk about these issues, we share a common ground which our investors who are concerned about these things as well. And so look we've been doing ESG for a long-time and I keep a book on my desk called the Standard Oil Spirit that was written in 1923 and it talks about our commitments to people, it talks about our commitments to protecting the environment, and this has been in the ethos of the company forever and it's evolved as society has evolved, and so we're committed to being a responsible company and being a part of the solution here in the US and around the world.

And our next question will come from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.

Q - Ryan Todd{BIO 15158570 <GO>}
Good, thanks. Maybe one follow-up question on biofuels on but on the liquid side of the biofuels market. Could you maybe provide an update on how you're seeing the liquid biofuels market relative to your expectations, particularly with a little time with REG acquisition under your belt? You're expanding pre-treatment in Germany, Europe, pushing things toward sustainable aviation fuel. So how is the market playing out relative to your expectations? How do you see the fastest you playing out between the US and Europe, and then maybe any update on the progress of the Geismar renewable diesel facility that you acquired from Reggie?

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Sure. So I'll start with the REG acquisition. The assets are good and the people are better, any surprises so far had been to the upside. We've already identified quick wins, commercial opportunities, we've lowered insurance and financing costs. Integration efforts are all on track and delivering on our expectations, we're seeing the placement of biodiesel in Chevron's West Coast refining marketing network and that continues to ramp up, we're optimizing freight in feedstocks across the system. So all of that builds on the strength both companies had in the renewable fuels value chain and we just see it as a really nice combination here.

The Geismar expansion is underway and we're halfway already to our renewable fuels target, that's completed. We indicated we're going to grow to 100,000 barrels a day. We're well on our way to do that. And of course, we're investing in other relationships. We've got a joint venture with Bunge. We're now participating in the soybean crush spread and bringing feedstocks into the system. We're working on converting the hydroprocessing capacity of our refineries to be able to run bio feedstocks. So this is part of our business that will grow the economics on it like anything in the Downstream, a function of feedstock cost supply-demand and markets but they've been good so far and we expect across the cycle and out into time that they're going to continue to be an important part of our portfolio. We are seeing more people go into renewable diesel it's a market that like any other commodity market at times may get long and margins may reflect that but we're familiar with those dynamics of our traditional business.

Q - Ryan Todd{BIO 15158570 <GO>}
Thanks, Mike. And maybe one more just maybe a little speculative but any thoughts on what you think the impact of the Russian product import ban in Europe and how that could play out in terms of product flows those barrels is likely to find a home in Latin America or Africa or do you think that we may actually see a decent amount of that resin products disappear from the market?

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Yeah, any of these export bans have to be looked at within the context of the broader market and as you say just as we've seen on crude, where the US has banned the import of Russian crude, Europe hasn't yet, that's coming and but it's a global market and you've got other buyers that need, they need the products and, they're not participating in the sanctions necessarily.

And so going to the earlier question from Neil about the products side of the business, markets are tight right now diesel in particular as we've seen here recently and likely to stay that way through the winter I think. Further, we get into the first quarter when the products ban comes into effect in Europe and I think that's going to be set against a backdrop of pretty tight product markets and you are going to find countries around the world need that fuel and you get into logistics and then you've got longer shipping legs, which do you have enough ships to move it and how do you -- how does the system re-optimize it's a less-efficient optimization for sure then moving into the natural closer markets. But I do think that you'll see those products continue to flow although go to more distant markets with increased costs and logistics and continuing to keep some of this pressure on the overall balances out there.

And our -- our next question will come from Lucas Herrmann with Exane.

Q - Lucas Herrmann{BIO 21221621 <GO>}
Well, thanks, Mike. Thanks so much, Mike to be able to chat with you. Two, if I may, the first few Pierre just remind me in terms of associate contribution towards the top-end of the range, I think the indication of $3 billion at the top-end of the range but perhaps you could give some indication of the level of dividend pay-downs of associate to date. I guess I'm a little surprised that in the current environment one might expect that the associated dividend would be, will they be on the, 3 billion? And then Mike just if you could just give us a whirlwind tour of some will win but just talk around the Gulf and the developments that are taking place there within your own portfolio and how those are proceeding and your current thoughts on timing arbitrary. Thank you.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Okay, I'll let Pierre start, and then when I come back, I'll just ask you to clarify Gulf of Mexico. (Multiple Speakers).

A - Pierre R. Breber{BIO 18332161 <GO>}
Look, you're right that affiliate's dividend paid last quarter we guided to be above the top-end of the range and now we're guiding at the top-end of the range which we increased during the course of the year and that reflects really two items Angola LNG has in the affiliate income line been generating earnings all year but during the first-half of the year the cash return was a return to capital and the dividend, and so it's showing up in a different part of the cash flow statement.

And then the second item is given the uncertainty at CPC, TCO is holding more cash. We will get more cash out of TCO but I think TCO appropriately is just being cautious and Mike said all of our barrels are flowing in October, we expect them all to flow in November. we expect the repairs to be completed shortly. Now that said they are just being cautious and holding a little higher cash balances. So we'll be at the top-end of the range through 3Q. I think we're at about $2 billion of affiliate dividends you can confirm that with Roderick but the reason why you're seeing that the cash flow line of affiliate income less dividends being a little bit larger than maybe you would expect it's primarily those two drivers in terms of the quirks of Angola LNG accounting and TCL holding cash balances which will be a temporary thing and we expect that that we'll see higher cash in the future from them.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Okay. Gulf of Mexico, Lucas as you know we're one of the largest leaseholders in the Gulf, we've got over 270 leases out there and a strong base business, a lot of installed infrastructure that enables capital-efficient brownfields development, and importantly it's one of the most carbon efficient assets in our portfolio with the apparent intensity of about six kilograms of CO2 per barrel of oil equivalent. Lease sale of 257 is the one that was in question here a few months ago as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act that's been clarified in that lease sale is proceeding. We picked up 34 leases in that sale and we look forward to continued leasing by the federal government has indicated and kind of encouraged by the Inflation Reduction Act and we'll participate in those.

In terms of production growth, we will advance a number of projects that are underway right now. Jack St. Malo has a multiphase pumping project that starts up this year and some additional development drilling Bigfoot has ongoing development drilling and water injection that will begin in the first quarter of next year. Mad Dog 2 is operated by one of our partners and I would refer you to them for an update on that project.

We've got at St. Malo our waterflood first injection plan for next year anchor, a new greenfield project. We expect first oil on that in 2024. For Wale, another greenfield project, operated by one of our partners, we expect first oil on that towards the end of 2024 and then we recently took FID in the second quarter of this year on the Ballymore project and expect first oil on that one in 2025.

So, I appreciate the question because oftentimes I hear people say well we can see the Kazakhstan growth, we can see the Permian. what else do you have? We've got a string of projects there in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico that are kind of sequentially lined out that will steadily contribute to production growth here in the US from the deepwater.

And our next question will come from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.

Q - Biraj Borkhataria{BIO 17234528 <GO>}
Hi, there, thanks for taking my question. I've got two lefties. first one is just going back to Kazakhstan and CPC. My understanding is there has been sort of fortuitous timing for 10 years because one of the other projects in Kazakhstan has been offline which is allowed Tengiz to flow despite the fact obviously being lower. So I was just trying to understand hypothetically if Kazakh production comes back on up to full capacity but the pipeline capacity is maintained to be reduced or is not full capacity, then all the projects get pro-rata down equally, or is there any other project that we need to be aware of there as it relates to Tengiz? And then the second question is on your LNG portfolio performed extremely strong this quarter. Can you say what proportion of your energy portfolio is sold under long-term contracts and what proportion is installed on a spot basis, is it for the year for over the medium term? Thank you.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Yeah, so at CPC, I mentioned earlier that right now only one of the three single-point moorings is operational the other two are down for some maintenance and repair work, that's well underway. And so we would expect that work to be complete and to be able to handle four flows on CPC here before too long. If for some reason that didn't happen and we were constrained to the one SPM. That has the capacity to load out at about 70% of what CPC can move when it's operating four, so there would be some constraints on movements. TCO has long been the initial, the largest, and in many ways, I think the most important shipper on that line, and that's reflected in some of the practices that, I don't want to get into the details but we would still be able to flow barrels maybe, not all of our barrels but I think TCO would be well-positioned to not be disadvantaged. Let me say that. If there were some sort of proration underway.

A - Pierre R. Breber{BIO 18332161 <GO>}
Hey, I'll just add that the nominations for CPC for November have already been put in place in Tengiz. TCO essentially got a full nomination even for November and again that's even in a situation if the SPMS are not repaired, of course, if they are repaired by then on issue but even if they stay down for November TCOs already received a full nomination.

On the LNG question Biraj, it's notionally around 80% contracted, 20% spot. That's a combination of both of our Australia LNG operations and our West Africa operations. West Africa tends to be almost all spot in Australia is closer to 9010. So that averages out to about 8020 and we'll give guidance on our spot price sensitivity, we'll do that in the fourth quarter call at the end of January. It depends on how many spot cargoes are produced both out of again our West Africa and Australia operations.

And our next question will come from Irene Himona with SocGen.

Q - Irene Himona{BIO 1758849 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Good afternoon and congratulations on the very strong results. My first question, your financial framework is clearly to manage through the cycle but at the same time, the current uncertainty on the commodity price outlook is rather extreme and that is partly because of the risks of fears of a recession. So my question is as you look at your Downstream businesses whether in the US or Asia, have you seen any signs of an economic slowdown, which would cause you some concern as you look ahead to 2023 and which might perhaps drive a more conservative approach to CapEx growth? Thank you.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Yeah, Irene, thanks. Demand remains pretty strong globally across the product barrel. Though there are some variations in that. Certainly, the US West Coast which had some refining issues, and prices reflected that. We saw gasoline demand in the third quarter responsive to those higher prices and a little bit of softness there. Diesel demand has been pretty strong around the world, maybe a little less so in China given some of the lockdowns that they're seeing and aviation demand has been steadily coming back as people are flying again not quite to pre-COVID levels yet but steadily increasing and so overall, I wouldn't say that product demand that we've seen to date is sending a strong signal that a recession is underway or that the economy is significantly slowing. As I said there is always some kind of regional or maybe sectorial unique characteristics but no, we're not really seeing that yet, Irene.

Q - Irene Himona{BIO 1758849 <GO>}
Thank you. My supplementary question if I can go back to renewable natural gas, please, LCFS prices have more or less halved over the last year. I wonder if you can, help us understand the impact if any on your own R&D, does it create some pressures to perhaps work more on the technology to try and reduce the costs given that the value of the incentive is half what it was last year? Thank you.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Sure. So let me set the incentive aside for a second. In every one of our Downstream businesses, we're always working on reducing costs and improving technology and finding ways to become more efficient and so that's inherent in our business. The dynamics around LCFS credits, RINs, AB 32 credits in California, the EU trading scheme. All of these things we have to manage through their own cycles and it's a part of our business that is related to but not necessarily correlated to the fundamental supply-demand dynamics that drive physical flows because you have government allocations of credits and whether people are building inventories of credits or drawing down inventories of these credits and so they don't necessarily correlate with the underlying commodity. And we've got a fair amount of experience in managing that. Certainly, the economics on something like RNG rely on the credit structure and the regulatory framework that incentivized those businesses, and if you see the credits declining in value that it starts to the road a little bit of the margin in that business. We have to take a long-term view on these things and I think the regulators do the same, and as they see credit values reflect a lot of length and credits that suggests that the technology is advancing, the supply is advancing and they can set more ambitious targets and so these things evolve over time. and I think our people have a pretty good track record of managing in that environment. Thank you.

And our last question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.

Q - Paul Cheng{BIO 1494607 <GO>}
All right, good morning, thank you.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Good morning, Paul.

Q - Paul Cheng{BIO 1494607 <GO>}
Mike and Pierre, one question for each. First, is a simple one. In the policy in your presentation when you're talking about Downstream you were talking about what the chemical earning sequentially, was that up or down? You didn't mention in your presentation this point. Does that mean that Chemical earnings yes relatively flat, which is surprising given how much is the margin job we are seeing in the industry? So that's the first question.

Second question on money. Yes, for LNG, longer-term strategy. Most of your peers have been pretty aggressive in growing their LNG operations, you have very profitable or at least very cash full rich LNG operation but you don't really have much to grow at least on the table. Can you maybe elaborate that what is the overall longer-term medium to longer-term strategy in LNG? Thank you.

A - Michael K. Wirth{BIO 3445929 <GO>}
Sure, Paul. Yeah quickly on Chemicals earnings were a little bit lower quarter-on-quarter and that's really a function of margins. We had higher ethane prices and lower polyethylene prices and so the olefins margins which is the largest driver of our performance were squeezed. So it did go down sequentially.

On LNG strategy, we've long favored the Pacific Basin given the best customers we're in Japan, Korea, Taiwan markets, and our resource position in the Pacific. The Atlantic Basin we've got exposure to it but Europe traditionally has been a market where you are competing with Russian pipe gas and just less attractive. With the changes now that we see in markets, we are increasing exposure to Atlantic Basin LNG. We've done a couple of deals with Gulf Coast projects that are being developed that will give us offtake that we can move into global markets, and then we're advancing projects in the Eastern Mediterranean and the assets that were acquired with the Noble acquisition that would potentially allow an expansion of the Leviathan field to provide LNG supply that can go into global markets.

We've looked at other things. The big process has been underway in Cutter. We certainly were deeply involved in evaluating that opportunity. Like everything that we look at, LNG has to compete against the other investment opportunities in our portfolio. We're going to stay very disciplined on capital and we won't invest in everything that we could, we're going to invest in the best things that we can and I expect that will include some LNG projects over time.

Q - Paul Cheng{BIO 1494607 <GO>}
