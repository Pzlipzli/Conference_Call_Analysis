Daniel Binder{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to Walmart's second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call.

Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Good morning and thanks for joining us. A few weeks ago, we updated you on our expectations for how we would perform in Q2 and for the year. The second quarter finished stronger than we had anticipated and John David will touch on that in a moment and provide more detail for the back half of the year.

Our sales were well ahead of plan with inflation lifting our average transaction size. But we know that the amount and persistence of inflation is negatively affecting many families, from the U.S., to Mexico, to Canada, to Chile, they are prioritizing how they spend their money. We're pleased to see more families from a variety of income levels, choose us as they look for value. Our purpose is to save people' money and help them live better and that's especially important right now.

After the first quarter, we shared how the environment had changed. The cost of food and fuel, a heavier mix of sales and food and consumables, and excess inventory in general merchandise categories were among the most challenging items for us at the time. As we move through Q2, food inflation continue to tick-up and we continued to see a heavier mix of sales and food and consumables in many of our markets and that put pressure on margins overall. Food comps in the U.S. were up mid-teens for the quarter with units and food slightly negative and about flat exiting the quarter even with double-digit inflation.

Another weight on margins has been the number of markdowns we've taken. Starting back in March, we knew we needed to act quickly and aggressively in some categories and we have. We've made good progress to reduce inventory levels where we're focused and taken markdowns. The aggressive approach we took to move through apparel in particular, put financial pressure on us, but it helped really pressure on our stores and through our supply chain.

We're making good progress to reduce costs. We've reduced the number of shipping containers in our system, for example, by more than half from the Q1 level and are now much closer to our historical averages. We're also managing pricing to reflect our fully landed costs. The merchants are adjusting by category to reflect where we expect demand to be. We had our U.S. store manager meeting last week and amongst other topics we shared examples of items where we're holding prices down or rolling them back. Those tend to be opening price point, private brand, food and consumables items.

We want to help families put meals on the table with great value and our other private brands to relieve the pressure they're feeling. The quality value and convenience we offer, makes Walmart a smart choice and we're seeing more mid and higher income shoppers choose us.

As I've been in U.S. stores recently, I'm pleased, how we've executed back to school. As we finish it off in some markets, we've transitioned to back to college in the appropriate stores without reflect many refrigerators, floor-length mirrors and futons. In July, I got to visit our associates in India, after visits to Flipkart, Myntra, and PhonePe, a Flipkart fulfillment center and a (inaudible) to see how they're using PhonePe. I left even more excited about what's happening in these businesses and what's to come.

Having visited several of our international markets this year, I'm pleased by how connected we are now and how so much of what we're building is common across markets as we scale marketplace businesses and fulfillment advertising in financial services and take steps to make a bigger difference in healthcare.

As I look ahead, I expect a strong finish to back-to-school season and will quickly transition to the holidays. Our fall and holiday products look great. There's a lot of newness and we've got a strong position in opening price points across categories. From Halloween to Christmas, to Flipkart's Big Billion Days, we'll be ready. We'll have a cleaner inventory position and we'll have a strong seasonal presence.

We expect inflation to continue to influence the choices that families make and we're adjusting to that reality so we can help them more. Regardless of the inflation level and as we work through the places we have too much inventory, we continue to make progress on our strategy. We're becoming more digital even more relevant as an omni-channel retailer and the related businesses like fulfillment and advertising continue to grow. We're building a different business and we're making progress.

Let's move on to our operating segments. I'll start with Walmart U.S. The strong comps we see in food and consumables are leading to market share gains. Pickup and delivery are strong, growth is improving on walmart.com, including the marketplace and more people are choosing to be a Walmart Plus member or step up to in home. Walmart Plus is an important component of our plan. We announced the addition of a streaming benefit. Walmart Plus members will receive a Paramount Plus subscription at no additional cost as part of their Walmart Plus membership in September. The premium streaming service provide broad content offering with original series, movies, family shows, and live sports. We're excited about the coming launch and we know our members will be too.

Beyond membership, the team is also working on getting items to customers faster, while lowering the cost of delivery through a significant increase in the number of orders fulfilled by stores. We've increased this volume by nearly 40% from a year ago. Speed matters, whether it's how quickly we get items to customers or how quickly we scale new businesses. Our white label delivery platform service Walmart GoLocal will celebrate its one-year anniversary later this month, powered by our Spark Driver platform, I'm excited about the growth I've seen so far and the expectations looking ahead. We passed 1 million deliveries so far with GoLocal. We expect to have about 5,000 pickup locations by year-end and client satisfaction scores are strong.

We continue to sign up larger-scale customers and we're making strides on the bigger unlock, which are small and medium-sized businesses. Our technology and expertise will help so many of these businesses grow while contributing to our operating margins over time. Advertising is also performing well and Walmart U.S., the Walmart Connect team continues to deliver more value to the suppliers and sellers who advertise with us. Improvements to search and our large first-party shopper data have led to performance improvements for our advertisers both year-over-year and sequentially.

We've seen the number of active advertisers investing with us increased 121% over last year. Even more encouraging, these improvements have supported the overall site experience for our customers by helping them find the right products or discover new ones that are most relevant to them. As you've heard us say before, advertising is a global priority for us. We continue to see strong growth in markets outside the U.S. like India and Mexico.

Turning to Sam's Club in the U.S., comp sales were strong again for Q2, up 10% marking the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth. Similar to Walmart, gross profit was pressured for the quarter on higher-than-normal markdown activity to clear through excess inventory. We'll continue to make progress as we move through Q3 and we'll be in good shape as we enter the holiday season. We like what we see in terms of membership, total counts are up about 9% over last year, and a penetration of plus members continues to decline.

Moving on to Walmart International where we performed well again in Q2 with sales up nearly 10%, including double-digit comps in the three largest markets of Mexico, Canada, and China. We're also accelerating our digital businesses including strong e-commerce growth over the last two years. Mexico is up 31%, Canada 32%, and China a 152%. We see this growth even as customers choose to do more in person shopping. It really shows the power of operating across multiple channels.

Like the U.S., we see the effects of inflation come through and how people are shopping. In Mexico, we saw a formats perform well and Bodega was especially strong with comps about overall Walmart's average. We widened our price gaps for Bodega by 140 basis points in Q2, and we're seeing more customers shopping this format. While inflation remains high, most of our markets are growing comps ahead of inflation. I'm proud that we're helping families access the things they need it at more affordable prices. I'll close today by thanking our associates for all they do every day to support our customers and members. I'd also like to welcome John David for his first earnings call with us.

And with that, I'll turn it over to him.

John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Thanks, Doug. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver another strong sales quarter. We're moving a lot of volume through our business and I'm proud of how our associate team has responded and serving customers as we manage through this unique period. We delivered strong topline growth with total constant currency revenue up more than 9% in the second quarter. Sales were strong across all segments, particularly in food and consumables. Customers are increasingly choosing Walmart to help them save money as they deal with broad inflationary pressures.

As we navigate the current environment, we know that we're not immune to large macroeconomic shifts. We're facing similar cost pressures that others are seeing related excess inventory, fuel prices, and supply chain. But our business model is structurally sound and our market position is strong. As the years progressed, we've seen more pronounced consumer shifts and trade down activity.

As an example, instead of daily meets at higher price points, customers are increasing purchases of hot dogs as well as canned tuna or chicken. Private brand penetration has also inflicted higher and in food category, specifically the private brand growth doubled, compared to Q1 levels. We'll continue to manage pricing for customers in a way that preserves our price gaps and allows us to earn market share profitably. We've been very focused on managing controllable costs and consequently achieve expense leverage across all three segments in Q2 even though we haven't fully left the wage investments implemented last year.

During the quarter, we also made progress reducing inventory, managing prices to reflect some supply chain costs and inflation, and reducing storage costs associated with the backlog of shipping containers. We're encouraged by the initial steps taken by some suppliers to help us reduce product acquisition cost. We've taken similar steps to manage our support and overhead cost too. And we're achieving significant savings in procurement of goods not for resale. In our stores and fulfillment and distribution centers, we've seen labor productivity metrics improve. We're finding efficiencies and resistances while still focusing on operational excellence.

I want to spend a moment discussing inventory. As a backdrop, the shifts that we've seen in consumer behavior through the pandemic shifting from in-store to online along with big swings in the purchase of goods versus services and then the reversion back to pre-pandemic norms have been sharp and difficult to predict. These trends have been exacerbated by inflationary pressure on the consumer that many of us have not experienced in our lifetime, the effect of which has recently changed consumption patterns in certain categories for us, notably general merchandise. The result of all of this put pressure on our inventory levels that peaked in the last quarter.

Importantly, the team has a deep understanding of our inventory levels and content, and it made a lot of progress during the last quarter. And stock levels have improved about 250 basis points since Q1 in our grocery business alone, despite the heavy sales volumes we're experiencing. We also made progress selling through excess inventory, especially in hardline categories. At the end of Q2, Walmart U.S. inventory growth was 26% versus last year, reflecting over 750 basis points of improvement from Q1 levels. Notably, about 40% of the year-over-year increase relates to inflation.

General merchandise inventory growth rates are down more than 15 percentage points from Q1, but still with more work to do. We've cleared most summer seasonal inventory but we are still focused on reducing exposure to other areas such as electronics, home and video games[ph]. We've also canceled billions of dollars in orders to help align inventory levels with expected demand. We estimate that only about 15% of our total inventory growth in Q2 is still above optimal levels. And our actions in Q3 will allow us to make significant progress toward rationalizing absolute level mix which will enable our stores to be well-positioned ahead of the holiday season.

Despite the short-term challenges we're facing this year, we continue to advance our flywheel strategy and diversify our income strengths. For example, the global advertising business grew nearly 30% in Q2 led by Walmart Connect and Flipkart as new advertisers turn to Walmart to deepen relationships with customers. We now have over 240 million items in our U.S. e-commerce assortment, and our marketplace seller count has increased a 60% year-over-year. We continue to sign on more customers to our data ventures offering and the number of Walmart Plus memberships continues to grow.

We're also excited about the build out of automation and technology throughout our business, and how it will continue to help drive greater efficiency. Through my first couple of months here, I've been able to get out and visit our stores and see our distribution fulfillment centers and witness this approaching automation and technology that we're putting in our stores and centers. One example, is the VizPick technology that we've rolled out to our associates across U.S. stores. This tool uses augmented reality to speak inventory management process, enabling associates to get needed product from the back room to the sales floor more efficiently. This not only saves associate time, but also helps avoid missing sales through side counter out of stocks. It's a win-win.

In summary, our business is resilient. And with the omni capabilities we've built, we're better position now than we were in prior periods of economic softness. Now, let's get to some additional Q2 financial details. As mentioned previously, each of our segments delivered strong sales growth. Walmart U.S. comp sales accelerated to 6.5% growth, reflecting strong grocery sales in a higher average ticket size. International constant currency sales were up 9.9% with strength in Mexico, Canada and China, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered comps of 10% excluding fuel and tobacco.

Consolidated gross margin rate decreased a 132 basis points, reflecting increased markdowns and unfavorable mix shifts in our U.S. business. Sam's Club gross profit was also negatively affected by a LIFO charge due to higher inflation. On the expense side, selling, general and administrative expenses leveraged 45 basis points helped by higher sales partially set by the U.S. wage investments implemented last year.

Operating income decreased 6.8% and adjusted EPS was a $1.77, two discrete items positively affected our results. Operating income benefited from a favorable insurance settlement of $173 million during the quarter. Adjusted EPS also benefited from this as well as a $182 million special dividend from one of our equity investments. Operating cash flow was $9.2 billion reflecting lower operating income, higher inventory amounts due in part to inflation and the timing of certain payments. During the quarter, we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Through Q2, we are ahead of pace on our original share repurchase plan for this year and now expect to repurchase $10 billion to $11 billion in shares for fiscal year 2023.

Now, let's discuss segment results. Walmart U.S. comp sales momentum continued with growth excluding fuel of 11.7% on a two-year stack. Food sales were especially strong with mid-teens growth, while general merchandise sales were soft particularly in electronics, apparel and home. Transactions increased 1%[ph], while average ticket increased 5.5%. We were pleased to see e-commerce sales growth improved sequentially up 12% year-over-year in Q2 and 18% on a two-year stack. SG&A expenses leveraged 21 basis points, reflecting higher sales, lower COVID cost, partially offset by the wage investments. The team did a nice job pivoting the expense structure so the scheduling challenges from Q1 did not repeat.

Gross margin pressure led to a decline in operating income of about 7%. International had another really good quarter. Sales were strong at 9.9% in constant currency. Currency headwinds negatively affected reported sales results by about $1 billion. Each of our major markets delivered positive comp sales with Mexico and China leading the way. E-commerce sales on a constant currency basis grew 15% on top of strong gains last year. Comp sales in Mexico increased nearly 11% with strong growth in stores as well as e-commerce sales which grew 18%.

The team is doing a good job reinforcing our price message and positioning as customers manage through this inflationary period. In China, comp sales were more than 14% with strong growth in e-commerce sales which increased 77% in the quarter and more than a 150% on a two-year stack. E-commerce penetration continues to decline in both our Sam's Clubs and Hypermarket stores as customers increasingly choose omni solutions to meet their shopping needs.

Canada comp sales increased more than 10% even as higher levels of inflation are starting to pressure consumer spending in discretionary and general merchandise categories. Flipkart continue to meet our expectations and the team is gearing up for Big Billion Days. I travel to India last month and was impressed by how the Flipkart and PhonePe teams are innovating for the customer and driving growth. PhonePe continue to see strong growth with annualized TPV of over $830 billion, reaching a record level of monthly transactions of about $3.1 billion. International operating income in constant currency increased more than 28%, partially attributable to the previously mentioned insurance coverage for prior operational disruptions in Chile.

Sam's Club had another strong sales quarter with comp sales up 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of more than 20% on a two-year stack. Transactions increased 9.8%, e-commerce sales grew 25% with strong contributions from both curbside and ship to home orders. Membership income was up nearly 9% with another record high quarter and overall member counts and continued growth in plus member penetration. Sam's added more new members in Q2 than any other quarter in recent years, benefiting from membership campaigns. Sam's leveraged expenses a 131 basis points including fuel and 72 basis points excluding fuel, due primarily to higher sales and lower COVID cost. But gross margins were down as elevated markdowns, supply chain and fulfillment cost and a 70 basis point inflation related LIFO charge pressured profitability. As a result, operating income declined about 35%.

Now, let's turn to guidance. With the updated financial guidance we released last month, we outlined the pressures that led us to take a more conservative outlook for the current year profitability. Let me take a minute to provide you with more detail. When we provide guidance three months ago, we didn't expect food and fuel inflation to accelerate to the levels that we experienced in Q2. In fact, Walmart U.S. food inflation was up double digits year-over-year and we saw a nearly 400 basis points step up as the quarter progressed compared to levels at the end of Q1. The rising costs for essential items and customers reprioritization spend led to significant mix shifts in our business.

Grocery sales mix increased nearly 300 basis points whereas general merchandise sales mix decreased more than 350 basis points. This resulted an additional general merchandise markdowns in our U.S. business, particularly in apparel at a time when inventory clearance was already higher than expected in the industry. Higher fuel prices also pressured our supply chain expense.

We finished the quarter on a strong note, however and ahead of our updated Q2 guidance provided last month. And the Q3 back-to-school season is off to a solid start contributing factors to the better performance included strong sales at the end of the month with good flow through to the bottom line and lower-than-expected supply chain cost. We're taking additional pricing actions in Q3 to improve inventory levels in the back half of the year. And we've built in more conservative category mix assumptions within our guidance. Sales and profit view reflects trends we've seen year-to-date as well as the uncertainty around inflation and consumer spending in the coming quarters.

We've updated our fiscal year '23 guidance to reflect the better Q2 results versus the guidance we provided in July. We continue to believe the sales and profit guidance we provided at the time for the back half of the year appropriately reflects elevated uncertainty in this environment and is our best view of expected performance.

For Q3, we expect net sales growth of about 5%, including comp sales growth of about 3% for Walmart. U.S. We're expecting operating income to decline 8% to 10% and adjusted EPS to decline 9% to 11%. For fiscal year '23, we expect net sales growth of about 4.5%, including comp sales growth of about 4% for Walmart U.S. We expect adjusted operating income and EPS to decline 9% to 11%. Excluding the effect of divestitures this would translate into net sales growth of 5.5%, and a decline in adjusted operating income and EPS of 8% to 10%.

Before I close, I'd like to share my perspective as someone that is new to Walmart and meeting many of you for the first time. I'm excited to join the company at such an opportunist and transformational time. Certainly, retail broadly is being pressured right now, but that shouldn't detract from the incredible opportunity that we have in front of us. It starts with our mission of helping people save money so they can live better. We do that every day at a scale that is unmatched by helping people be able to buy the things that they want and they need. This mission permeates our culture in everything that we do.

I've joined an exceptional leadership team, their history of operational excellence, their strategy, the drive to win is simply something that I wanted to be a part of. And you combine that with the resources we have, and the investments we're making in things like supply chain emission, improving our e-commerce capabilities, and diversifying our portfolio with higher margin products and services like data and advertising that will result in more durable earning streams as they scale. We have the potential to not only be relevant and a chapter retail, but help define it. And when we execute on these things, we have the ability to appreciably increase our shareholder value over time. I believe that some of the best days at Walmart are in front of us.

I look forward to working with you. And now we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Thank you.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)

Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your question.

Q - Bob S. Drbul{BIO 3131258 <GO>}
Good morning. And John David, welcome, congratulations.

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Thank you.

Q - Bob S. Drbul{BIO 3131258 <GO>}
Maybe two quick questions if I could. The first one I think, Doug, you mentioned that sort of middle- and high-income shoppers are choosing Walmart. Just wondering if you can elaborate some more on the trade into Walmart that is allowing you to take market share in grocery? And the second question is, just wondering if you could give us a little bit more flavor on what you're seeing? What you saw sort of with sales late in the quarter and what you really seen so far early Q3? Thanks.

A - Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, hi Bob, this Doug, I'll get off in and then, John, to comment. In the Walmart U.S. business, we have seen mid to higher income customers come to Walmart looking for value as you would expect food and consumables in particular are places where they're looking to save some money. That's not it will surprise I think the strength of it is encouraging.

And as it really to the end of the quarter there were several things going on, fuel prices started to move a little bit, back-to-school was strong. And then this income phenomenon that you pointed to also provided some strength to the last week or so of the last month of the quarter, which is a little different than the pattern that we had seen in the first two months of the quarter.

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
And it was a bit different than May and June for sure. And it has led to the beginning of Q3 being stronger in places like back-to-school, food and consumables continue their momentum. And I think the big know it really changed and late Q3, I'm sorry late Q2 early Q3 was traffic count was a bit stronger than what we'd seen in the end the in two months.

A - Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
We were laughing before the call started today about some of the anecdotal stuff that's going on. It won't surprise you that backpacks are strong, for example, but it does such as how strong men's flannel is. And we've got a program that's just under $12, up by two of them personally, and it's a great value and at the same time, some of our clearance price points have gotten really low. We're trying to work through we would call season two apparel and we've got new stuff selling well. So, it's almost like you can point to different areas to kind of make the case for what you want to sell story to be.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Kate McShane{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Our question is centered around markdowns, we're curious if the level of markdowns that plan to be taken in Q3 will be at a similar level as what you did for Q2. And it sounds like inventory will be much cleaner by Q4, but it seems like there's still a lot of inventory in the industry and the consumer that might need to be motivated by promotions given the end of inflation. How should we think about the markdown environment than in Q4, even in the context of cleaner inventory at Walmart?

A - Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Hey, Kate, this is, Doug. Thanks for the question. I think, what we should do is hear from all three segments as it relates to that. We've made progress, John, why don't you go first, but let's also hear from, Kath and from Judith.

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Yeah, good morning, Kate. I'll start with the second quarter from the end of Q1 and end of Q2, there was some definite progress in inventory about 750 basis points of improvement. We've viewed Q2 as being most urgent to clear through the apparel and summer seasonal that we needed out of the way and sold before Q3 really began to arrive. We certainly made progress in apparel. There's more work to be done in inventory in general with a 25% increase and about 40% of that inflation and remaining does two things.

One, it helps us in terms of in stock, we were out of stock last year all throughout the year, so we have made improvements on in stock. I think our results in many categories reflect improvement and available in stock, but then there is some backlog that we continue to work through. At the end of Q1, we said this would take a couple quarters to work through. I would just reiterate that that remains true. And we will continue to leave room to make sure that we manage our inventory levels well and head into position in Q4 in the end of the year that would be proud of.

A - Judith McKenna{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
I think the fact that we were so lean last year combined with how much inflation impacted the number has kind of been lost in the story a bit. It's true that we've got too much inventory and that that created markdown pressure particularly in Walmart U.S. apparel. But when we look at the overall inventory as John David has already commented today, it's not like a vast majority of it is merchandise that we didn't want. We just were turning goods a year ago and a year before that frankly. It's such a high level that we needed that inventory just to fill side counters and to fill our features.

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
And in 2020, 2021, we would have had record sell throughs and seasonal categories with very few markdowns at the end of seasons. And so, of course, there is some normalization to get back to work. We might have been before the pandemic began, but again, we still things to work the remaining excess inventory.

A - Judith McKenna{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
We're repeating ourselves, but the level of and the pace at which inflation changed in the first quarter and that continued in food and consumables into the second, just cause behavior to flip fast. And it caused apparel to be more difficult than what we anticipated and that's where the dollars pressure came from. Kath, do you want to go next?

A - Kathryn McLay{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
Yeah. Probably just say, if I look at what our inventory position at the moment for the last two years like we talked about, we've had ten quarters of double-digit comp. For the last two years, we've struggled to stay in front of having enough inventory. And then so we're offer deflated base when you look at what our current position is. This year then also you have the contraction inflation.

But what we've seen is that we've got really good quality inventory. We're really happy for the seasonal sets we've got. Halloween looks fantastic back-to-school, back-to-college has been good, tailgating has been great. I think, what I would say is in our number in this quarter, a portion of it has been markdowns and a portion of it is actually an inventory reserve, because we wanted to get in front of it and just make sure that we put aside the money for Q3. So that we can have a really strong Q3 kind of results. So that's how we've addressed markdowns in Q2.

Now to international, we saw some good progress on inventory quarter-on-quarter. Some of that helped by the FX position on that, but underlying as well. I think as I look at it about 75% of our increased year-on-year is absolute land for is. You've heard that leanness that we had last year is really coming through and I think that's a theme for everybody, we just didn't have enough inventory at that time, that means about 25% of it, which is some GM categories in a couple of markets specifically, which would be Chile and Canada. But I'm very comfortable with the way that the markets have dealt with that. And just as a reminder for at least Chile, our quarter end is a month earlier than the enterprise quarter end, so we're already seeing some of that currents happening for that market.

Operator

Q - Peter Benedict{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
All right. Good morning guys, thanks for taking the question. Just want to talk little about grocery, the strength there probably in food. Can you talk about pricing? How you're managing that, I know units it looks like they were down for the quarter, but improvements I guess flattish as you exited the quarter. Just how are you thinking about pricing relative to units. What's the promotional environment you're seeing within grocery? And just how the grocery strength is put in store versus online and curbside? Thank you.

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Hey, good morning, Peter. It's John. Let me take your question and then parts for just a second here. I mean first, value is always top of mind when it comes to us and deciding how we want to serve customers. So, it will always lean on the value for the customers above other things. And what we want to do and what we've tried to do throughout the entire period is go up as late as possible. We certainly have been passing prices through when we see things like landed cost of goods going up, those have to be passed through where manage our supply costs as well as we can. U.S. did strengthen throughout the quarter particularly in July and late July.

I think you heard that earlier so seeing some positive units there was refreshing giving how we had started the quarter, fuel prices were coming down. So, I think that could have some of an impact as well. In terms of the market, we're really focused on everyday low price, and we have a strong rollback campaign all across the store, which would include food, consumables and general merchandise. And then in general, just across the food categories are availability improvements, I think you can see in stores more consistently and across categories.

Just you remember this time last year we had pockets about a socks that kept emerging it's the only one who really face and the second quarter in a big way was baby formula, which is now improving.

A - Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
The unit stories one the transaction count being up a little and this environment is also important to call out the average basket was way up, but it's great to see transactions grow in the Walmart U.S. business also.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Proceed with your question.

Q - Stephanie Wissink{BIO 17692025 <GO>}
Thank you. Good day, everyone. I wanted to follow up Doug on your comments regarding how the basket is shipping for consumers. I think you mentioned in the proteins category and even some areas of private label strengthening. Can we take us into the household budgeting that you're seeing with respect to your transaction structure? And then as you're looking at your guidance for the back half and maybe a follow up with this what you're assuming in terms of the basket composition by class of good or even within private label versus national brand? Thank you so much.

A - Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
John, you've jumped in here too. I think what you should take away from Q3 and Q4 guidance is that we're expecting the environment to look a lot like Q2. And as it relates to the choices people are making that thing I would call out, John's, variety. Like you've got all kinds of income level shopping in different ways. And we've seen strength in some categories. It's really encouraging for those that are under the most pressure that are most price sensitive. Private brands are stronger. Pack sizes are different. Opening price points, John, you might talk a little bit about what you saw at the holiday meeting, looking ahead for things like the Thanksgiving meal. It seems to be a great job of protecting opening price points for people that are most price conscious.

A - John Furner{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yes, Steph, I was thinking back one of the meetings we had in New York in 2020, we talked a lot about serving customers flexibly as we develop the different businesses and sort just tag on the, Doug's, comments. Serving customers and store or something we have pressure on the longtime or pick up business continues to deliver growing with Walmart Plus. So the variety of ways that we can start customers I think has been helpful, especially given the number of ships customers have had in their lives last couple of years from it home and then meeting in many cases back out into the workplace. I was -- as customers change we can serve them a number of ways.

When you think into products our wide portfolio of products both in e-commerce and in stores, including the numbers you heard from John David earlier and marketplace, give us the ability to serve a wide range of customers. And then, as Doug mentioned last week, we had all of our managers together in Denver, which is always a fun exciting experience to get the team together.

But when I heard consistently is that the team is doing a very nice job balancing out, how to improve quality and sell higher price points and remaining focus on opening price point. So, having thanksgiving meals in a position where you can buy an entire meal for under $50 for a family of four is exciting. So, there's a value play, there's quality play and wherever the customer goes and how things shift will be ready to serve them and we're building the capabilities to be able to do that at will.

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
I'll just add, this is John David, as it relates to our guidance speak in the back half of the year, the swings that we've seen in consumer behavior have been difficult to predict and the pace at which they've happened has been sharp. So, our guidance for the back half really just assumes no change. And what we're seeing in the second quarter in terms of mix changes in our business.

Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Welcome, John David.

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Thank you.

Q - Michael Lasser{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Walmart has been experiencing some discrete and arguably temporary factors that are weighing on its profitability this year, including staffing issues in 1Q and the well-documented inventory issues to looking towards next year, when some of these inflationary pressures, inflationary cost pressures are going to seemingly roll back and you will have move through some of the challenges and the underlying drivers of the alternative operating profit growth should continue. Why wouldn't Walmart be in a position to generate growth above its long-term algorithm in 2023?

A - Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Sure. I'll take that, Michael. Thanks for the question. You're right. Certainly, we've incurred some cost this year that are more call it one-time in nature related to the supply chain and higher inflation. But it's difficult to predict how long that will persist. Certainly, the inventory situation has gotten better, but the effect on the mix changes in our business that are largely the result of higher inflation and that may persist for some time. And so, we're being cautious with respect to the outlook we're, obviously, not giving guidance for next year, right now.

But look, that what I'd point you to is the conviction that we have in our long-term plan has not changed, has not wavered. When you look at the long-term plan that was laid out by the management team previously, in terms of what we're doing with the flywheel strategy, the ability to grow operating income faster than revenue. And you look at that over a multi-year basis, we have as much conviction and today as we did when we laid that out. So, very excited about the future, but the short-term period this is a moment in time and we're being cautious with respect to the outlook because there's a lot that we don't know.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Edward Yruma with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Edward Yruma{BIO 4940857 <GO>}
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. John David, curious in your perspective given your most recent stop on Walmart's advertising fintech businesses. I know, you have a lot of experience from PayPal on that. How do you that's kind of where they're at today and kind of how do you think about the longer-term growth opportunity? Thank you.

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Sure. Appreciate the question. Well, certainly, I am a believer. And what's happening in digital payments, fintech broadly and the secular tailwinds that exist there with consumer behavior moving more digital, more online. And if you look at the investments that Walmart's been making in those areas, whether it's be expanding their e-commerce capabilities, their marketplaces, even getting into financial services. As I have an early peek into what the company is doing, I've got to say I'm very impressed with the broad capabilities and the resources devoted to this. And so I think it's a huge opportunity for Walmart going forward. And frankly, they're the reasons that I'm so excited to joint to be part of this and help shape that outcome.

A - Kathryn McLay{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
Maybe it's worth adding on financial service as PhonePe in India. You heard that we were there is and John David, you were there with us as well and got to visit the business. It was -- you would have scene from the scripts that we had today that they grew their annualized transact TPV to $830 billion last quarter that was $770 billion. So really good progress there and there are also now got monthly transactions at the point $1 billion a month, which is incredible.

I think, what's really encouraging with the way that they are approaching this base is they're looking not only at payments, but also at merchant services and that two sides of network is an important part of that. But equally starting to expand in financial services as well with a real focus at the moment on insurance and pushing that and their knowledge and the ability to share that knowledge around the world and help other markets, such as Mexico from a best practices. What they should be looking at has been incredibly even on one of the real benefits of being a global company.

A - Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I'll just add to what you just said. I shared the excitement that we all had when we went to India and met with the team. To put it in perspective what PhonePe is doing, and if you look at the largest digital paying companies outside of China and the world. PhonePe after a very brief history is already roughly two-thirds the size of that and what is going to be the largest market in the world in a very short period of time. So it's a really exciting opportunity.

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Sure. I think you also asked about advertising. The relationship between digital growth, market play growth, advertising is something that we're trying to take advantage of. In the case of the U.S. business, the ability to attribute sales later on to in-store transactions makes us uniquely positioned and we've made a few enhancements lately for people that are consuming advertising from us.

A - Judith McKenna{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
We have, Doug, and knowing more about customers in the way they shop, knowing more about them in retail is important and the growth and pickup and delivery and the growth in plus the growth in market place and e-commerce all help us be able to identify the right sellers and suppliers that we can connect. Hence the term, the name Walmart connect. We can't connect them together to have an environment where not only is it accretive to the profit and loss statement, but more importantly accretive to the customer experience and help them get to exactly what they're looking for.

A - Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I can't remember a business with the margin structure of the advertising business here at Walmart and having 30% growth for the quarter was nice to have.

Q - Kelly Bania{BIO 16685675 <GO>}
Hi, good morning. And I'll add my welcome to you, John David.

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Thank you, Kelly.

Q - Kelly Bania{BIO 16685675 <GO>}
Lot of comments on the inventory, but just had a couple of more. Can you clarify the dollar amount of inventory that you estimate would be excess? And can you help us understand how much of that is in apparel or other categories and the magnitude of markdown that you expect to clear through that and the timing of when you expect to get back to a clean position? And I guess, the follow-up on that, do you at all think that discounting from you and others in the industry pull forward some demand through from the second half and have you considered that into your second half guidance?

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Sure. I'll take a stab at that, Kelly. So, if you think about just take the U.S. inventory increase in the second quarter of $11 million. If you decompose that about 40% of that is due to inflation. So, don't think units, think just dollars. And then you look as, Doug noted at things like the fact that we're growing as a company that we've had less in stock next year and you normalize for you really will that down to about a $1.5 billion of inventory that if we could just wave a magic wand would make go away today. And the fact is we'll sell that. But if we were to start from scratch that's what would get rid of. In terms of the types, as John noted that the inventory issues were most acute in apparel in the second quarter. As we look into the third quarter, I'd say it's home, electronics and apparel are probably the areas that stand out the most.

Our next question is coming from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Simeon Gutman{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone. Still focusing on gross margin. The U.S. gross was down about a 106 or so or 107 in the second quarter. And how much is mix versus markdown? And to us, it looks like the mix is not getting any worse if that's fair. And then the clearance levels in Q3 versus Q2 will the clearance/markdown occupy a greater proportion in the third quarter versus the second?

A - Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Sure. Simeon, I will take a stab at that as well and John might want to jump in. So it's I'll just point you to the 132 basis point decline overall in gross margins. And there's really three things and I would say in order of magnitude that contributed to about call it two-thirds of 75% of that. So number one would be markdowns. Number two is mix. And number three is the LIFO charge that we talked about in Sam's. And then there's all the various puts and takes that round out the balance of that.

As it relates to markdowns in the third quarter, look, we feel like we're in a better inventory position and those are obviously very related. And so we would hope that we're not going to see the level of markdowns that we experienced in the second quarter, but, we also assuming nothing changes with the consumer. So, as we noted, we're being cautious on the outlook and we'll wait to see what happens.

A - John Furner{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
In the U.S., Simeon, this is John. In the U.S., we did not have the LIFO charge, so a larger percentage of our markdown issue would have been apparel. We still have a bit more to work through, but we're close if you compare to where we might have been before two years ago. So, we're getting close to a position where apparels behind us and that was the issue that throughout Q2 we spent the most time worrying about because we need to move through it because the goods have been purchased a long way out.

And regarding the rest, it's in Q1 and then in Q2 has the backlog of containers worked itself through that has created a lot of what the issue is today, where we have a good thing would have liked to have had months ago, and then this season is all here at the same time. So, we've ingested all that inventory, and we've largely gotten out of the container, storage and movement business, we have the inventory and the network. So we have a good handle on what we own where it is. And then as I said earlier in the call in Q1, we need a couple of quarters to work through it and that's exactly what it is so, John David's, right. We'll sell it, we'll work through it. Yes, there will be some liability in it, but apparel was definitely the issue that we had that was most queued and what have really heard and not addressed in Q2.

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Simeon, sorry Dan go ahead.

A - Dan Bartlett{BIO 3071809 <GO>}
I was just going to saying Simeon on your mix question. If you look into our filings, you'll see our mix change year-over-year and you'll see that in Q2 as well when we filed our queue. At the end of Q1, it was a fairly significant ship as we were lapping stimulus saving -- stimulus spending. We recalibrated our expectations at the end of Q1 and then it was even worse than we expected for Q2. So, that's what you're seeing get reflected in our view as we look to the back half. We've want to kind of get ahead of ourselves just because sales have been strengthening at the end of the quarter.

A - Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. I was going to kind of double click on a little -- on that a little bit more to fuel coming down in recent weeks is whole. It's still about 27% inflated per gallon versus a year ago, nationally. So the absolute spend that an American family is deploying to fuel is still high, high is the amount of food inflation. And I think Q4 last year and where we started to see U.S. food inflation tick up. It was kind of low to mid-single digits. So when you get to Q4, you start to anniversary of food inflation number against a food inflation number. So the two-year stack of food inflation will be something that we'll be keeping an eye on.

If you told us that fuel was going to continue to take down and that food inflation was going to moderate that influences how we think about general merchandise inventory. And as we worked with the merchants over the last few weeks, it's been fascinating to think through how you make choices item by item and item by -- and category by category, because you don't want to go into too much of a defensive mode. And we were looking at Halloween decor last week on in there are some things outdoor decor particular like inflatables that are really fun, cool new items. And when you see them, you're like we can sell all you can buy that. Like we're going to blow out of some of those.

And we want the buyers in some categories to have that mentality to be aggressive and other places we want to be more conservative. So that we don't repeat the mistakes that we've had in the first half of this year. That's such an interesting thing to work through. It takes a lot more leadership from our merchant team, for example, that it might ordinarily. We think we have made some good decisions subcategory by subcategory for the back half of this year, cancelled some orders trying to get that right area by area so that we don't end up being too conservative so we shouldn't be.

Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes, Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.

Q - Robert Ohmes{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I think I'll follow up on that, Doug, and I think it's probably harder for you guys to predict where fuel prices are going, but you have some visibility on food inflation given how large you are a player in that. It accelerated a lot in the second quarter, has that continued in the third quarter. And I guess there's the guidance, it stays at the level of the second quarter or do you think it could be up more in 3Q before maybe it fades against comparisons in the for -- any kind of color on what you're assuming would be great?

And a quick second one for Kath, is just the home in apparel comps were much stronger at Sam's was that all clearance, or is there something from between Sam's and Walmart U.S. in terms of home apparel sales?

A - John Furner{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Hey, Robbie, it's John. I'll take the first part of your question. In relation to -- as a relates to food inflation, it definitely moved up in the second quarter and moved up in the months of the second quarter. So, July was higher than June, June was higher than May. I think it's too early and into the third quarter to try to make a call, if this is where we'll be, if it'll go higher go down. So for now, we're assuming that this is the level we're at and it continued.

And some of the factors that would you consider is one of the costs that are part of the way we price food is the cost of moving food. So, if diesel fuel and fuel continue to move down that could be a tailwind related to inflation. However, there's still time commodities up. We do see a few categories in the store where prices are starting to come down, but there are other categories where we're so rising. So I think, it's just too early to call in the quarter. Certainly hope that some of these larger macroeconomic conditions would lead to lower prices and food, but we're not able to say that we see that happening just yet.

A - Kathryn McLay{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
And it's Kath from Sam's, on the home and apparel. What I say is it's actually a multi-use story. So it's not clearance. It's been the investments we've made in the quality that we've had in home, apparel and seasonal. And we're seeing better quality brands and we've seen that resonate with our member base and that has continued through into this year.

A - John Furner{BIO 19351533 <GO>}

The next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please processed with your question.

Q - Rupesh Parikh{BIO 22151706 <GO>}
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So first on the markdown front. I was curious if you can at all comment on what you've as you view as excess markdowns if we try to think about next year. And then secondarily on Sam's Club gross margins declined nearly 300 basis points. I want to get a sense of if you expect any of that to be structural or do expect that to recover the margin declined over time?

A - Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Hey Rupesh, good morning. On markdowns that I can break it into pieces. Last year and the year before, there weren't really many markdowns to speak of because we were chasing demand and many cases the end of the seasons were very clean. So returning to a point where there are in the season markdowns is a pretty normal thing that we would experience. And the way we're trying to manage these sales season by season as compared to historical rates back in 2018, 2019. And of course things are always going to be different, but it's a good barometer to determine where we land.

The second, the business is much larger than it was in 2019. So these volume levels continue to improve, which then leads to the dynamic of how much you purchase, which ultimately the amount you purchase versus demand will lead you to yourself through and markdown number. So for the fourth quarter, we mentioned we cancelled billions in orders. We feel much better about the back half of the year. We still have the inventory to work through ingest from the backlogs as we said, so we need a couple of quarters to do that.

And then heading into the next year, we'll have purchasing levels that are more in line with the way we see demand is that's going today, of course, a lot can change, we need to know more about fuel pricing and inflation. And state of the consumers we get there, but we have definitely had more time and more success in getting purchasing in line with our current inventory levels and the way we see demand going as it interprets today.

A - Kathryn McLay{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
And for the Sam's part of the question I would say. If you look at our GPA rate, there's two major things going on there. One is the LIFO charge of $123 million and the another one is what we had called markdowns, but there's two things that are play there. The largest part of that amount is a strategic decision we made to create an inventory reserved for Q3. And so that's really pulling forward those markdowns from Q3 into Q2 to set ourselves up for success and to make sure that we're really compare to buy into Q3. So I don't see that as a trend. I see that as just this quarter the impact on this quarter.

The next question is coming from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Please processed with your question.

Q - Joseph Feldman{BIO 4772233 <GO>}
Hey guys, thanks taking the question. I wanted to check in on what you're seeing with the supply chain these days? I mean, I know fuel cost has come down and we're hearing container cost prices have come down, but are you getting a more regular inventory as you need at this point or just review of the global supply chain would be really helpful? Thanks.

A - John Furner{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Hey Joe, it's John. First, let me just say, a big thank you to our supply chain team, our merchants, they have been through a lot today has been extremely dynamic and they have really just made a huge difference for the entire company. Last couple of quarters, what's it been like, there was the backlog of containers that really started last fall, when the port's backed up. We've worked those through in terms of container cost, they are down from where they were, but they are still higher than they were a year ago and a year ago was higher than it was higher than they were the year before that.

So, still inflated those costs are flowing through. Fuel costing as you know, started earlier. Fuel has come down from its peak at the end of Q1 early Q2, but it still remains elevated. And those are real costs that are passed through and customers will see those prices at the counter and on the side. So, in general, the better flow, we see better availability, our availability rates and food, consumables and then our consumable portions of general merchandise are much better than they were a year ago.

But I still think we have work to do to get back to work back in 2019 and even in places and anytime in retail that inventories back up the way they did this cause pressure on being able to get the right inventory at the right location in front of the customer. So, optimistic that can improve as these inventories come down, but it's going to take a few more months to work through the backlog of the inventory that's in the network.

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Sure. I would just add from P&L perspective and you think about the cadence of earnings from 3Q to 4Q. We started experiencing more pronounced supply chain cost in 4Q last year. So from a cost side, that makes the comps a little bit easier and if you're thinking about operating income in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Chuck Grom{BIO 3937478 <GO>}
Hey, thanks very much, and welcome, John David. When you unpack the factors behind the better back-to-school and strong finish in July, and it sounds like in August so far. I guess, how would you rank the key contributors in a lower gas prices there's their big uptick in state tax holidays this year versus last? And I guess has the improvement altered your view of the upcoming holiday seasons in any way in terms of how you think consumers going to react?

A - John Furner{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Hey, Chuck, good morning. I think there are three factors that stand out and you'll see these on the numbers. One is there are more customers shopping in the brand and what we've seen previously including better traffic numbers. Fuel prices did come down throughout the month of July. And I think the third as important as school attendance levels we think will be higher, very few instances of schools that are remote at this point and there were some of those last year. So things like backpacks and lunch boxes and then there are other programs where some school lunches were paid for last year that this year will be funded by families and parents so often.

And all of those factors that are leading to more spending, and that led to more spending late in July and early in the third quarter. As far as how it relates to the rest of the year, again still a lot of unknowns we get into the rest of the year, fuel prices are still moving because they continue to move down that would be a great thing. And we'll have to watch the shape of the consumer and see how they're buying. But I would just reiterate what, John David said earlier, we are really committed to the long-term plan and our long-term view of the business. And it's been great to see some of the improvements in the areas on the flywheel that are adjacent to retail that will help the overall business over the long term.

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
John, I would add as it relates to better-than-expected performance for 2Q. As noted supply chain cost, assuming better than we expected. And in any quarter, when you close you're going to have some puts and takes at the end of the quarter, some may fall in your favor, some may work against you. In the first quarter, supply chain costs came in worse than what we expected when we closed the quarter. And so, when we updated our guidance at the end of last month, we had a similar expectation. It actually fell the other way in our burdens that contributes to the better-than-expected performance relative to our guidance in the last month.

A - Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I would just add. When you are thinking about thing about supply chain costs or getting invoices all quarter end-to-end, a lot of the things that we were experiencing these last several quarters have been unusual, container fines and excess fuel charges and things like that. So, there was it was a higher expectation of higher costs and it just came it fell favorably.

Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Ben Bienvenu{BIO 18962123 <GO>}
Hey, thanks. Good morning. I want to ask when you move through a cycle like this with consumers trading down and between prices and you gained market share and pick up new customers. How sticky does that share end up being on the other side of this inflation? Might we see this bolster your long-term share position and maybe leave you guys coming out of this environment in a stronger position with the consumer. And then as a follow up, that you're seeing middle- and upper-income household trading into Walmart. What do you think from lower-income households? Are you seeing any trading down away from Walmart?

A - John Furner{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yes. We certainly hope to hold share around the world. And I think this inflationary environment is going to last for a while. So people are going to be value conscious, which plays to our strengths. The e-commerce experience end-to-end is a focus of ours. We want to continue to grow our pickup and delivery businesses around the world. We of course want to grow and maintain share with customers spend in the stores as well. Moving away, I think if any of you want to comment your can, I think we are holding at the lower end and adding at the upper end, generally speaking.

And I think that's exactly right. And in relation to the first part of your question, Ben, what have we seen in previous cycles. We did see some pickup in the last cycle that was a downturn in 2008-09. But there feelings that are different now that I think I would like to point out. And at that time period, we had our store business and a small e-commerce business. We did not have food pickup, we didn't do delivery from stores. We didn't deliver groceries. We did not have Walmart and home, we didn't have Walmart Plus. So, our ability to serve customers more flexibly -- in a more flexible manner than what we could have 13, 14 years ago, it was pretty dramatic.

So, definitely a lot of work to do to ensure that we're taking care of those customers and we're focused every week on satisfaction scores, accuracy of delivery things like first time pick rate, which is an indicator of did you get your entire order ride at the very first time we try to deliver it. Those will all be important in terms of being able to hold on to new customers. But we definitely have a number of ways that we can serve customers a day that just quite frankly did not exist lining through a downturn.

Planning to sell some more Walmart Plus memberships to help solidify those relationships and the Paramount announcement should help us do that?

A - John David Rainey{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Yeah, we're excited about the announcement, Doug, the brand Paramount has a lot of programming for kids, plus sports, there are other movies and drama. So it's a wide variety of content that I think our members will enjoy. And that was quite frankly a member-led research. When we talked to members and ask what are the benefits they were looking for, the number one feature outside of delivery of product from both source and e-commerce was an entertainment benefit. And there were others they talked about, but entertainment was the top of the list and that's what led to the decision to add this benefit to the program.

Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. Now I'll turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks.

A - Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. As usual, thanks for your attention. We appreciate you focusing on our company. I'll just wrap up with maybe three points. The first one is hopefully you're seeing in the result and hearing from us that we're making progress. We're addressing our inventory issues, our pricing to reflect our cost structure. Secondly, more people are choosing Walmart and Sam's Club and our brands around the world being a business in Mexico, for example, is really strong.

So being able to attract more and more customers and more diverse set of customers is a positive for us. And then third, we're continuing to change the business, execute our strategy, our e-commerce growth, our digital transformation, growing the marketplace, growing these related businesses that are unlocked by this digital transformation that's happening in the company is something that we're focused on, regardless of the short-term pressure we're making progress towards the longer term.

We certainly hope to put the pressures that we've had in the first half behind us as quickly as we can, claw back the operating income percentage delta that we've experienced in the first half to the extent possible as fast as possible. But as you can see in our guidance, we acknowledge reality. The world around, around the world is feeling various pressures most pronounced from inflation, of course. So, we think we put ourselves in a good spot to continue to make progress and value when customers and members are focused on values is something that plays to our strengths. So we'll take full advantage of that. Thank you all.
