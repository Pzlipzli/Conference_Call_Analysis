Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the speakers' presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Mr. Danyal Hussain
Thank you, Michelle and apologies everyone for the brief delay and welcome everyone to ADP's fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call and webcast. Participating today are Carlos A. Rodriguez, our CEO; Maria Black, our President; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter, our earnings materials are available on the SEC website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call.

During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items, a description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.

With that, let me turn it over to Carlos.

Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
Thank you, Danny. And thank you everyone for joining our call.

We finished our fiscal 2022 with a strong fourth quarter that featured 10% revenue growth and 12% organic constant currency revenue growth. We also delivered a 170 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion, which helped drive 25% adjusted EPS growth and, for the full fiscal year 2022, we ended up with 10% revenue growth, 90 basis points of margin expansion, 16% percent adjusted EPS growth and importantly, we achieved record bookings and near-record level of retention, reflecting our strong position in the HCM market.

Let me cover some highlights from the quarter and the year before turning it over to Maria and Don for their perspectives. Starting with Employer Services new business bookings, we had a fantastic Q4 with growth accelerating from the prior quarter, resulting in our largest new business bookings quarter ever, and with the strong finish, we were very pleased to have delivered 15% ES bookings growth for the year. Despite several sources of global uncertainty, including the ongoing effects of the pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine, inflation, and concerns about global recession, our compelling suite of HCM offerings has continued to resonate throughout the market.

In total, we sold over $1.7 billion ES new business bookings in fiscal 2022 and well over $2 billion when including the PEO. Marking the first time we've exceeded $2 billion in bookings. Maria will talk more about the growth opportunities ahead, but clearly, we are incredibly pleased with what is the best performance by our sales force that I've seen in my 20 years with ADP.

Moving on, our full year ES retention of 92.1% was nearly flat versus last year's record level of 92.2% as we once again exceeded our expectations in the fourth quarter. Client retention is driven by several factors, including product and service quality, business mix, and macroeconomic factors and our expectations at the start of fiscal 2022 call for macroeconomic factors like SMB out of business rates to drive some normalization in retention towards pre-pandemic levels. We did see some of that play out, but clearly less than anticipated.

More importantly, our product and service teams have continued to deliver a best-in-class experience for our clients and particularly so on our modern and skilled platforms. We achieved record client satisfaction levels for the year and we once again set new record levels for retention in several of our businesses, including our mid-market. So, although you will hear from Don that we are once again making an assumption for a modest amount of macroeconomic related normalization in retention in fiscal 2023, we are excited to have delivered such a strong performance in fiscal 2022 and look forward to maintaining our retention rates at these historically high levels.

Moving on to the employment picture, our pays per control growth metric was 7% for the quarter and 7% for the year, reflecting a persistently strong demand environment for labor among our clients that has continued to exceed our expectations. This growth has served as a testament to the resilience of our clients and although we expect pays per control growth will naturally slow in coming quarters, employment conditions today remain strong with our client data suggesting that near-term demand for labor remains healthy. And, finally our PEO business delivered another great quarter as it wrapped up a strong year. We had average worksite employee growth to 14% in Q4 and 15% for the year and we were thrilled to have crossed the 700,000 worksite employee mark this quarter.

As you know, I joined ADP two decades ago when ADP entered the PEO market through an acquisition, and as bullish as I was about the PEO industry back then, I'm not sure I could have anticipated we would be here 20 years later still growing at this combination of pace and scale, but the ADP (inaudible) team continues to deliver a great platform, great service and a great benefits experience for our PEO clients and there is plenty of opportunity for us in the years ahead to serve even more businesses.

Taking a step back, fiscal 2022 was unique in a number of ways. We experienced strong demand with over $2 billion in worldwide new business bookings and near-record level retention, which together drove us to surpass 990,000 clients at year end, putting us on track to exceed a million clients any day now. At the same time, we've had to manage this growth in volume with prudent headcount growth given tight labor conditions. The way we've been able to do that is through efficiencies, of course, but also some plain hard work by our associates, and for that, I thank them for their efforts and for coming through for our clients, once again.

I will now turn it over to Maria.

Maria Black{BIO 18851760 <GO>}
Thank you, Carlos. With fiscal '22 behind us, I want to take this opportunity to review where we stand on some key initiatives and provide an update on where we are heading in fiscal '23. At the core of our client experience is their interaction with our platforms and one product initiative, we have talked about throughout fiscal '22 is our new unified user experience, which was designed to be more action oriented and contextual and to move us from transaction-oriented applications to experience-oriented applications. In other words, more intuitive, better looking, faster and more consistent across our solutions. To achieve this, we have applied for research driven approach informed by the data and insights we have gained and working with our nearly one million clients.

Our focus has been to listen to our clients, learn from them, and utilize their input to design the best experience. In fiscal '22, we move hundreds of thousands of clients over to this new user experience, including our clients on RUN, iHCM and Next-Gen HCM as well as over 20,000 Workforce Now clients. We also moved the ADP Mobile app over to the new UX. Feedback so far has been extremely positive and, in fiscal '23, we plan to expand this rollout further to remaining Workforce Now clients as well as two additional modules and experiences within our key platform.

Workforce Now, in particular, has been exciting for us for a few reasons beyond user experience. First, is it's growing traction in the US enterprise market. Just this quarter, ADP was rated for the first time in overall customers choice provider in Gartner's Annual Voice of the customer study. This was the highest peer possible and was based on prospective from end users with a 1,000 or more employees and is a reflection of our continued momentum in selling Workforce Now to the lower end of the US upmarket these past few years. This momentum builds on the already strong presence and traction Workforce Now has had in the US mid-market in HRO space and in Canada, all places where it is highly differentiated.

Second is the continued rollout of our Next-Gen Payroll engine to a growing portion of our new Workforce Now clients. Our Next-Gen Payroll engine not only benefits from having a global native and public cloud architecture, but also empowers our platforms like Workforce Now to offer a better product experience and enable us to offer better service. We are incredibly excited for our Payroll engine to continue to scale up to larger and more complex Workforce Now clients over the coming quarters, and finally with talent and engagement and increasingly important aspect of HCM suite, we continue to focus on our ability to help employers better connect with their employees.

This quarter, we will launch a new offering that we're calling voice of the employee a robust employee survey and listening tool, which leverages survey instruments from the ADP Research Institute to offer clients a way to seamlessly capture employee sentiment across the employee lifecycle, and one of the things I love about this solution is that it was born out of the elevated client employee engagement, our return to workplace solutions have been able to drive and it reflects the ability of our global product team to quickly identify an opportunity and develop a solution to meet the need in the market.

Moving on, we made some exciting enhancements to the Wisely program this quarter. Most notably, we now offer Wisely self-enrollment with full digital wallet capabilities for Apple and Google Pay, thereby, allowing employees to instantly receive and start using their Wisely account without support from their employer and without having to wait for a physical card. We also expanded our work-earned-wage access solution by offering a seamless one app solution for Wisely members through a deeper integration with one of our key partners. The offering enabled employees to receive portions of their earn wages prior to pay-day and most importantly is free for employees who use Wisely.

With these enhancements and more on the horizon, we're incredibly excited about the growth prospects for Wisely and look forward to taking it from over 1.5 million active members today, to an even larger portion of our US payroll base over the coming years. During fiscal '22, we also highlighted the strength of our retirement services business, a key component of our HCM suite. We offer record keeping services, provide unbiased independent advisory services and give our clients their employees and financial advisors access to over 10,000 investment options from over 300 investment managers, seamlessly integrated with our key platform and with the ADP Mobile app. With over a 125,000 retirement plan clients leveraging solutions, including Form 1-K simple and sub-plans, we are proud of our scale today, but even more excited about the significant opportunity in the market as we look to expand our market share within and beyond our payroll base of clients.

Fiscal '22 was an incredibly strong year for our retirement services business and we are looking forward to another strong year. And finally, our Next-Gen HCM solution is getting closer to a broader rollout as we continue building on the implementation capacity for our pipeline of sold clients as we shared at last year's Investor Day. While we are excited about all of these product enhancements and others too, product only drives growth when our sales and marketing organization can match it to a buyer and translate it into new business bookings. And to that end, we are excited about our sales and marketing momentum and the continued investments we have plan to drive growth this year.

First, the product improvement, I just mentioned, as well as many others are all intended to drive higher win rates and expanded breadth of offerings or higher price realization and we fully expect our sales force to continue capitalizing on these opportunities. Second, we are making continued investments in both digital and traditional marketing into our brands and into our broad and growing partnership network. Third, we are excited to have invested at year-end in sales headcount and are stepping into the new year with hundreds of additional quota carriers and we expect to be able to grow our average sales headcount in the mid-single digit range, over fiscal '23. Continued execution on our products and our sales and marketing strategy is ultimately designed to drive sustainable growth and, for fiscal '23, we expect to drive ES bookings growth of 6% to 9% bracketing around our medium term target of 7% to 8% from Investor Day. Growth is a priority for us and we look forward to continuing to update you on our progress.

Now over to Don.

Don Mcguire{BIO 20657090 <GO>}
Thank you, Maria, and good morning everyone. Our Q4 represented a strong close to the year with 10% revenue growth on a reported basis and 12% growth on an organic constant currency basis ahead of our expectations, despite higher than expected FX headwinds from the strengthening dollar. Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 170 basis points about in line with our expectations as leverage from strong revenue growth overcame higher selling expenses, PEO pass-throughs, and growth investments like the sales headcount growth Maria just mentioned. And our robust revenue and margin performance drove 25% adjusted EPS growth for the quarter supported by our ongoing return of cash for investors by a share repurchases.

For the full year, revenue landed a 10% growth. We delivered 90 basis points of margin expansion, offsetting a few different sources of incremental expense over the course of the year and adjusted EPS grew to $7.01, up about 16%. For our Employer Services segment, revenues in the quarter increased 8% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic constant currency basis. The stronger than expected revenue growth was a function of continued outperformance on key metrics, like retention and pays per control, and our ES margin increase of 140 basis points was a bit lower than previously planned as a result of growing headcount faster than previously anticipated.

For the full year, our ES revenues grew 8% on a reported basis and our ES margin increased 110 basis points. For our PEO, revenue in the quarter grew 16% accelerating slightly from Q3. Average worksite employees increased 14% on a year-over-year basis to 704,000 as bookings, retention, and same store pays all continue to perform well. PEO margin was up 260 basis points in the quarter due in large part to favorable workers' compensation reserve adjustments. For the full year, our PEO revenues and average worksite employees both grew 15% at the high end of our guidance ranges and our margin expanded 80 basis points.

I'll now turn to our outlook for fiscal '23, beginning with some overall remarks. We have on the one hand an inflationary environment that is creating upward pressure on our expense base, and at the same time, we recognize there is clearly concern about a potential upcoming global recession or that we perhaps are already in one. On the other hand, our momentum entering fiscal '23 is strong and there are no obvious signs of near-term strength and if the market forecast of higher interest rate holds, we are positioned to benefit from a continued rebound in interest income. So, our focus for now will be to continue executing on our strategy and, to that end, we have been and will continue to be making investments in headcount where we perhaps didn't get a chance to the last year in the tight labor market, but we also expect to deliver growth that's at or above our medium-term annual objectives shared on November 21, Investor Day.

On to the numbers. Beginning with ES segment revenues, we expect growth of 6% to 8% driven by the following key assumptions. First, we expect our ES new business bookings growth to be 6% to 9%, which Maria covered. For ES retention, we finished the year at 92.1%, a touch below last year's record level and we believe it's prudent to anticipate some further normalization of SMB of business levels in fiscal '23, even while we maintained record retention levels in some of our other business units. Our initial assumption is for a decline of 25 to 50 basis points in ES retention for the year. For pays per control, with employment back in your pre-pandemic levels, we anticipate a return to a more typical 2% to 3% growth range.

We normally talk about prices contributing 50 basis points to our ES growth rate. We expect that benefits to be around 100 to 150 basis points this year, and for client funds interest revenue, we expect higher overnight interest rates and higher repurchase rates on maturing securities should combined with our continued balance growth to drive interest income up nicely. Our short-funds portfolio, which is invested in overnight securities will benefit assuming the Federal Open Market Committee increases the Fed Funds rate over the course of this fiscal year, and our client extended and loan portfolios will benefit as we reinvest maturing securities at an expected rate of about 3.3%. Between those two drivers, we expect average yields to increase from 1.4% in fiscal 2022 to 2.2% in fiscal '23. We expect our client funds balances to grow 4% to 6% supported by growth in clients, pays per control, and wages and this is on top of the very robust 19% growth we experienced last year.

Putting those together, we expect our client funds interest revenue to increase from $452 million in fiscal '22 to a range of $720 million to $740 million in fiscal '23. Meanwhile, the net impact from our client fund strategy will increase by a bit less from $475 million in fiscal '22 to a range of $675 million to $695 million in fiscal '23 and, as a reminder, this is the number that impacts our adjusted EBIT.

The slightly lower growth here is due to the expected increase in short-term borrowing costs, which track the Fed funds rate. This borrowing enable us (inaudible) our portfolio to invest further out of the yield curve that we otherwise would. As we gradually reinvest maturing securities, this gap between client funds revenue and the net impact from our client fund strategy should reverse and again become positive.

Back to the ES revenue outlook, one more factor to consider is FX headwinds. Clearly, with the year-over-year (inaudible) period into the dollar with a weaker pound and with about 20% of our ES segment revenue being generated outside the US, we're factored in a fair amount of FX headwind for fiscal '23 of well over 1%.

For ES margin, we expect an increase of 175 to 200 basis points. This coming year, our expense base will be increasing more than it does in a typical year, in part due to inflationary pressure on overall wages and in part due to headcount growth. Some of which we did late in fiscal 2022 and some of which we're planning for fiscal '23, but because our margins are benefiting from strong revenue growth outlook, including growth in client funds interest revenue, we're pleased to be able to guide to the strong ES margin outlook.

Moving on to the PEO segment, we expect PEO revenues and PEO revenues excluding zero margin passthrough to grow 10% to 12%. The primary driver for our PEO revenue growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 8% to 10%. That would represent a bit of a deceleration from last year, but, of course, we are contemplating much less contribution from same-store pays per control in fiscal '23 compared to fiscal '22. This peaked 10% growth compares to a high-single digit target that we outlined at the Investor Day in November. We expect our PEO margin to be down 25 to up 25 basis points in fiscal '23, compared to a strong margin results in fiscal '22.

Adding it all up, our consolidated revenue outlook is the 7% to 9% growth in fiscal '23 and our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 100 to 125 basis points. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '23 to increase slightly to about 23% and we expect adjusted EPS growth of 13% to 16% supported by buybacks and I'll make one comment on cadence (inaudible), because we expect year-over-year headcount growth to be more significant early in the year and because the benefit from client funds interest will build as the year progresses, we expect adjusted EBIT margins to be down about 50 basis points in Q1, but then build steadily over the rest of the year.

And I'll turn it back to Michelle for Q&A.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions). We'll take our first question. Our first question comes from Bryan Bergin, with Cowen. Your line is open.

Q - Bryan Bergin{BIO 18956694 <GO>}
Hi, good morning. Thank you. Wanted to start with a demand question first. Can you just talk about what you've seen across client size, as it relates to demand environment? I heard the continued optimism in the mid-market. Can you talk a bit more about up market, down market, international and then just give us a sense of bookings cadence, it sounds like it accelerated through 4Q. Have you seen any change in pace as you've gone through the first couple of weeks here in July?

A - Maria Black{BIO 18851760 <GO>}
Yeah, absolutely. Bryan, I am happy to comment on both pieces. So, with respect to the overall strength that we saw in new business bookings, both for the full year fiscal very, very proud of the remarkable results. So, it's full year as well as the fourth quarter and the strength was really broad-base. There was solid performance across each one of our markets. I think a few call-outs that I would give, you highlighted the mid-market, the mid-market does continue to perform, we saw strength in our HRO offerings even beyond the PEO. The HRO was strength for us. I know I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention retirement services again. We also saw strong results in Canada, which was fantastic to see as Canada definitely was impacted a bit more with the longer lockdowns from the pandemic perspective. And then I continue to highlight quarter-after-quarter the strength that we're seeing in our down market and our RUN offer. So felt very pleased with the RUN.

And then last but not least on the international front, our international business had a tremendous year. So, very confident in the results, very proud of the work of the sales organization. As we think about the demand environment right now, you asked about how did it progress throughout the quarter and how do we feel sitting here a few weeks since July. I suppose I can't necessarily comment on in quarter, but I can comment on is we did see the results accelerate throughout the quarter. So while there was some macro-economic things happening in the world, our demand actually accelerated as we close out the quarter, So we saw significant strength, specifically the month of June. In fact, June was a record month for us ever as was the quarter and as was the year as mentioned. So, I feel good about the demand environment and acceleration that we saw throughout the quarter. Thank you for the questions.

Q - Bryan Bergin{BIO 18956694 <GO>}
Okay and then just a follow-up on margins. So, if things do slow down, can you just talk about the levers you have to insulate EBIT margins? it sounds like you have taken a healthy amount of resource additions. Can you talk about where you're making those across the organization and then where you might have some discretion to throttle investments should things slow down?

A - Don Mcguire{BIO 20657090 <GO>}
Yeah, it's very good question. So thank you for your question. I think as I mentioned in the remarks and the materials that we distributed, we were able to get our sales organization a little bit more than fully staffed going into the fourth quarter and that makes us feel really good about the opportunity to step off into '23 with a fully staffed team, which is something that as we mentioned in prior quarters is a little bit more difficult to do during 2022. So, I think we feel really good about where we are with staffing particularly in sales side. I would also say that just following the business model that we have If we look at the record sales we had particularly late in the fourth quarter, we need to make sure that we have fully staffed implementation resources to get those bookings generating revenue as quickly as we can. So, we will be focused on that and then, of course, just following through to the year-end process to make sure we can service all those additional clients and that time comes upon us in late December, January, February. So, we can do all those things.

On the other hand, as I referenced and as we're seeing in media and elsewhere, everywhere, there is talk about recession potentially coming or we are getting one et cetera, we still do have flexibility, of course, and we can certainly temper the addition of headcount and temper our costs more generally should we think that's necessary if it's something that's as a result of changes in the macro environment. So, I think we sell lots of levers and I think we've shown historically that we are able to navigate those waters pretty adeptly should that kind of a situation arise.

Q - Bryan Bergin{BIO 18956694 <GO>}
Right, thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh, with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.

Q - Kevin McVeigh{BIO 20680922 <GO>}
Great, thanks so much and congratulations on the results. This be for Carlos or whomever, but it feels like the retention step up is clearly a little bit more structural just given the recent trends in 2022 into 2023. Is that a function of kind of the Next-Gen payroll engine or just where are you seeing that success because it's clearly been a super super outcome post COVID, I think part of or focus was whether or not that starts to normalize enough, but it feels like it's a structurally higher level?

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
Yeah, there probably are some structural factors just because of -- we can see obviously where the retention is stronger and I think, as we mentioned, some of the macroeconomic kind of readjustment that we expected in the down market. We saw some of it just not as much as we expected but if talk of recession is correct and kind of business and bankruptcies and so forth, probably will kind of come back to some kind of normal level, which is why as Don mentioned in his remarks, we once again plan for a slight decrease in retention in '23. That's really mainly in that down market in terms of the mix it represents, the total represent of the mix, because everywhere else, we really see some reasonable what appeared to be structural improvements.

I wouldn't say that it's really Next-Gen payroll, because you're really going to see that impact of that on sales and market share and so forth in the next couple of years because the majority of our clients are still not enjoying, I think, the benefits even though over time they will of Next-Gen payroll. So, that's really not --just want to make sure I was clear on that, that is not what's causing the retention improvements, but one thing I would point out is -- I mean, I know this is a broken record, but we made this big transition from multiple platforms under one in the down market 10 years ago or a little bit more than that and then more recently, we went through multi-year effort, which was painful to do that in the mid-market.

We have other things going on like new UX and NextGen payroll, but those migrations and those consolidations in and of themselves have created some real structural tailwinds, I think, in terms of service, NPS, and ultimately on the retention stand, but it's just a much more an easier environment for our own folks to operate and it's easier for us to invest in less platform versus more platforms. It's just a much better environment. As you know, we still have work to do in the up market. So, there's still opportunity there. There is still some opportunity in Employer Services International as well, but we think these structural tailwinds that first helped us in the down market, despite the macro, the macro has really a cyclical issue, but overall, excluding cycles, our retention in the down market is up, I said this before, hundreds of basis points higher than it was 10 to 15 years ago and now the mid-market is at record levels and the NPS scores continue to be at record levels and I don't think we anticipate that going back down. If anything, we see more opportunity there in the mid-market and our plan would be to continue to do that through our other parts of ADP, to add more structural tailwinds to our retention.

Q - Kevin McVeigh{BIO 20680922 <GO>}
Super helpful. And then maybe this is for Don. It looks like the margin guidance like 100 to 125 basis points, up from 90. Given the leverage and float in pricing, it seems like really nice outcome on the pricing side. Is the offset kind of the cost inflation and where is the cost inflation in the model in '23 relative to where it's been historically?

A - Don Mcguire{BIO 20657090 <GO>}
Yeah, I think it's a good observation. I think there's a few things driving the course. We talked about more price than we historically have been able to take in and, of course, we have the tailwinds, if you will, from the client fund interest. So, there are certainly -- we need to remember that the reason we're getting the higher interest rates is that we're in a higher inflation environment. So, that's driving the overall cost base and wages. The other aspect is that we have called out and we typically have called out FX in the past, but we certainly seen, I think, what we would refer to as pretty dramatic changes in FX headwinds in the fourth quarter compared to what we've seen in typical years and so we thought that was important to call out and the 20% of our ES revenue being outside of the US and denominated in Canadian dollars, euros, sterling, Australian dollars, I think, all the currencies are essentially down. So, when you put all that stuff together, it certainly results in a little bit less of the top line dropping through the margin. So, that's in our focus. The other thing I'd say is that we do have a little bit of conservatism as we looked at the back half. We have to take into account all the things we are reading about and seeing and making sure that we're thinking hard about how to prepare should something happen in the back half of the year. So, I think those are the primary drivers to answer your question.

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
And if I can add one thing because you mentioned also price and it's a big topic I know for a lot of companies and a lot of questions about it. I think it's important for you to understand strategically right at a very high level regardless of how it flows into the numbers and so forth, our view on price, we set it for a couple of quarters now, is to kind of keep up with inflation. So, I want to make sure it's very clear that we're not achieving our margin improvements or doing anything that would be unusual because I think there might be some companies that are trying to make up revenue gaps from margin gaps with price because there is quote unquote cover out there to do that, but I think when you do that and I think Don has mentioned this before that we operate in a competitive environment and we look at what competitors are doing, we look at what's happening in the world, and we're long-term thinkers here. So, you should, assume that our price increases were in line with what's happening with inflationary costs and not anything more than that and not materially less than that.

Q - Kevin McVeigh{BIO 20680922 <GO>}
Been very consistent on that. Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Bryan Keane, with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Q - Bryan Keane{BIO 1889860 <GO>}
Hi guys, good morning and congrats on the numbers. I guess my question is looking at the mid-term outlook for Employer Services back in November, I think we talked about the 6% growth rate, and you guys are going to be trending above that 6% to 8% and, with the strength in bookings growing over 15%, I just wonder if maybe the mid-term outlook was a little low compared to what structurally is going on in the business model that potentially the growth rate is faster than the 6% outlook that you gave over a mid-term.

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
Well, I hope so. I'll let Don comment in a moment, but again just because I've been doing this for a long time, I can't get it out in my mind. The way the recurring revenue model kind of work is we love the 15% and what you just described really comes through in the numbers of the difference between our bookings and our losses are strong retention and our strong bookings that the net of that contributed more to Employer Services revenue than I've ever seen in my tenure as CEO and that is what has led that acceleration you just described in ES revenue. So that net new business growth is really the way to grow the top line and there's other factors in there like pays per control, client funds interest, but that's the core of the business and we're really happy with that.

The challenge, of course, is that we're not forecasting 15% bookings growth again next year. So, I would just caution you to -- now the good news is that increase in net new business is in our run rate now and so we don't have to grow by as much the next year in terms of that net new business to further accelerate our revenue growth, but I would just caution you in terms of, if you do that kind of math, it's hard, it's hard to accelerate the revenue growth rate of this Company. We just did it and it takes a combination of better retention and higher starts, higher sales, and new business starting in the upcoming year and that 15% really makes a huge difference, but you can see from our guidance that is not our expectation next year in terms of bookings.

And so you experience hopefully additional acceleration of revenue growth in ES, but not by as much as you had from '22 to '23, notwithstanding the fact that remember there are other things in there moving parts like Pays Per Control, Client Funds Interest and so forth, some of which will give us tailwinds, some of which may be headwinds.

A - Don Mcguire{BIO 20657090 <GO>}
Yeah, so Carlos covered off the main drivers and, of course I think just once again to go back and mentioned the FX headwinds we're experiencing. So, I think when you add that into the mix. I think probably we get to the place where we were landing and what we're anticipating for guiding Q4 for '23.

Q - Bryan Keane{BIO 1889860 <GO>}
Got it, got it. And then let me ask you another popular question that everybody is getting is just how the model might be different now versus previous recessions, is just thinking about the resilience potential in the ADP model?

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
I mean, Don again, has I think a couple of points he could probably make, but I would say, as usual, there is probably some puts and takes. I mean obviously I wouldn't be a CEO if I didn't say I think our model is better now than it was before even though I've been through a couple of cycles here myself. So, it's not that I'm criticizing anything other than myself if I'm saying that it's better than it was before, but we just talked about the structural retention level. So, even if we have a little bit of a drag in the down market and, by the way, the down market is a larger percent of our overall business than it was 10 to 20 years ago, but still it's structurally higher by several hundred basis points in and of itself. So, even if it goes down a little bit and it's a little bit bigger part of our mix, I think our retention is just going to hold up better I would predict in terms of depending obviously on the severity of the recession.

That's a huge help because bigger, obviously, the portion of the revenue that you retain each year, the less dependency you have on bookings in a recession, which tends to be the most sensitive like historically when you look at GDP growth and all of our metrics besides Pays Per Control bookings, it's something that can be challenging in a severe recession, which to reiterate, we don't see. So, we read the same things everyone else reads and we know the Fed tightening will lead to slower economic growth, but we really can't see it in our numbers like our Pays Per Control number in the fourth quarter was as strong as it was the whole year. You look at the monthly initial unemployment claims, you look at the room that's still is there in labor force participation, you look at the number of job openings in comparison to where it was historically and I just don't see it.

So, there clearly are pockets that are happening, I think, as part of readjustments because of COVID that are kind of confusing the landscape, and there is clearly some kind of slowdown underway, because it just happens when you have Fed tightening, but it's not happening in the labor markets at least not yet.

Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang, with JP Morgan, your line is open.

Q - Tien-tsin Huang{BIO 6065319 <GO>}
Thank you so much. Really strong sales. I was just trying to think about attribution of the strength in how you would rank factors there between better product set that's more relevant or it's just productivity expanded sales force, the cycle or secular things around outsourcing taking over versus software. I mean any interesting observations on your side, Carlos or Maria.

A - Maria Black{BIO 18851760 <GO>}
Yeah. Thank you. So, definitely, tremendous strength that we saw. I think I called out a few areas. Definitely, the strength that we're seeing in our up market continues to excite us for the future. I think you asked about the attribution of strength, and I think it really was broad based across the business, but I think from an execution standpoint, it really comes down to the execution of our sales organization and how we've been able to go to market candidly really over the last two years as it relates to navigating this evolving environment, but more specifically providing value to our clients in a more meaningful way and we really have seen that evolve over this past year as we've been really across each one of those segments, helping our clients navigate.

As I mentioned, the evolving environment inclusive of all the legislative changes. So, I think there is the value we're bringing, I think the strong execution in general across the sales organization and leveraging the entire ecosystem to bring that strength right, which is everything from our marketing investments or brand investments I spoke earlier to the headcount investment and, so all of this together I think lines itself to tremendous execution and strength as it relates to the overall performance.

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
And the other thing I would add to that is really I've been talking for the last 18 months about how -- one of the most important things for our sales organization was really to get productivity at the quota carrier level back to level back to and then exceed from a trend line standpoint where it was. When you think about whether the GDP trend or price trends or anything like that, you got to get back to where you were and then you got to get back on that same trend line, otherwise, you leave a lot of money on the table, right, whether this would be the economy or ADP's revenue and bookings growth and, from an attribution standpoint, again this, I think it's important to understand this color like we had unbelievable productivity growth and that's why I said that this is the best performance I've ever seen by our sales force and clearly some of it is because we were in recovery mode, but sales forces naturally generally have, not that I know I was never a salesperson, but I guess I've been around long enough to be hosting an honorary member but when you tell sales force, okay you got to grow, we're going to grow our headcount by a few percentage points and then we got to grow our productivity 2% to 3% point that we typical year right? and that's hard in a typical year. When you tell sales force, you have to grow your productivity close to 20% even though it's because it went down 20% that's freaking hard to do, very hard to do psychologically. Anybody who's in sales I think understands that and so these percentage growth numbers that we have and the productivity growth numbers that we have honestly are incredibly just gratifying because I really thought this was going to be hard.

I was, of course, keeping my poker face on and just telling everybody," because we have to do it, we have to do it" and we did it and so most of this growth came from productivity enough from head count because as we talked about, we actually had some challenges up until the fourth quarter in terms of achieving our headcount objectives. Not by lack of trying by the way, not because we were trying to save money because we were doing everything we could and it was just a difficult labor market. Good news is in the fourth quarter, as Maria has mentioned, we really did quite well and we're in a great position head count right now, but the '22 story is all of about productivity and that is an unbelievable accomplishment for our sales force and it's across the board.

A - Maria Black{BIO 18851760 <GO>}
It is and just to provide some action numbers to that. So, we reported $1.7 billion in Employer Services bookings. That is a record as mentioned, and it does exceed that the other record, which was pre-pandemic in fiscal '19 at $1.6 billion and so that really, in the end, speaks to some of this additional productivity that (Technical Difficulty), if you will, but Carlos says it is spot on, we did initially tell the sales force we will add head count and you have to grow faster, but in the end we didn't add the head count and they grew that much faster, which is why I'm very bullish and excited as we step into the fiscal year with more sellers, more active quota carriers to really couple the strength that we've had in productivity with now finally more sellers to go get after it.

Q - Tien-tsin Huang{BIO 6065319 <GO>}
That's great. Must be gratifying for sure. So I'll stop there with question. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Dan Dolev, with Mizuho. Your line is open.

Q - Dan Dolev{BIO 16010277 <GO>}
Hey guys, really nice results. I'm very happy to see this in the enterprise that you pulled out of each of these slides. Can you even tell us like and you don't parse out the growth between in the year, but if you did, would love to (technical difficulty)in terms of the different sub verticals, but on a bigger picture, can you tell us like what types of brands (technical difficulty) are you now regaining share in some of those like lower end of the large enterprise including both sides of (technical difficulty) and how these conversations are(technical difficulty) I'll be on the safety and how could safely? Thank you.

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
Yeah, I think you mentioned we were having a little trouble catching the entire question. So, maybe try to give a little bit of color, maybe you can repeat again or ask the question again, but I think you said something about the lower end of the enterprise space and kind of where the strength in sales is coming from. So, I think just to repeat what Maria said, I think, it is across the board, but that is one -- the reason I'm picking up on it, like this is really good news story for us. So, our Workforce Now platform, we made strategic decision two to three years ago, it makes sense, because it fits well on the lower end of the enterprise space and it's really been a home run for us there. So, against certain competitors, it's really very, very effective and we're selling a lot of units in that kind of lower end of the upmarket space for us as we continue with the rollout of Next-Gen HCM, which is really intended to further upmarket and eventually for global. In the meantime, we're really having a lot of success in the lower end of the upmarket with our Workforce Now platform.

And if you want to maybe repeat your question one more time, we'll give another try.

Q - Dan Dolev{BIO 16010277 <GO>}
Yeah, no, I think that's sort of answered the question. I wanted to know and I apologize you could not hear me before I wanted to know, like how the conversations are different today when you're with those clients versus, say, three years ago because I'm sure there has been a tremendous change given the results?

A - Maria Black{BIO 18851760 <GO>}
It's a good observation. There has been tremendous change. I think Carlos hit the nail on the head in the lower end of the upmarket. It's one of the reasons we cited the award and recognition we recently received from Gartner, because the conversation around our offering of Workforce Now, in that lower end is definitely resonating for several reasons, one is, a best-in-class product as Gartner even acknowledges and the users that were surveyed for that award, but moreover, it's also the speed by which we can execute and really take these enterprise customers and turn them into active clients and so meeting a lot of different needs from a product perspective, from a timeline perspective.

I think in the upper end of the market, certainly the conversation over the last three years has evolved. A big piece of that conversation is the global discussion and our ability to talk too much larger US enterprise customers and other enterprise customers across the globe around a multi-country offerings and how we're thinking about the way of thinking about our strategic direction on HCM on the global front and so I think the conversation continues to evolve on both ends of the spectrum of the upmarket and we're certainly in a position to have very formidable conversations and transformation (technical difficulty) thinking about how they are thinking about our strategic direction on HCM on the global front and so I think the conversation continues to evolve on both ends of the spectrum of the upmarket and we're certainly in a position to have a very formidable conversations and transformation discussions with our clients in that space.

Our next question comes from Mark Marcon, with Baird. Your line is open.

Q - Mark Marcon{BIO 1750332 <GO>}
Hey, good morning. Carlos, Maria, and Don. Great to see all of the years of hard work really pay off here this year. So, congratulations on the results.

I'm wondering, with regards to the new bookings. I mean $2 billion in total, $1.7 billion in ES, how much of that is split between new logos relative to upsells and how would you characterize your expectations on that front for the coming year?

A - Maria Black{BIO 18851760 <GO>}
Thanks, Mark, and thank you for acknowledging the strong performance in bookings. There is really no news to report here. I think we cited it for years really to split between new logo and client business remains at that 50% kind of 50-50 going forward and that's really what we expect heading into fiscal '23.

Q - Mark Marcon{BIO 1750332 <GO>}
Great. And then with regards to the forecast, Don, you gave us a bit of a cadence sense for margins. How would you characterize it for revenue and specifically what I'm interested in is you did mentioned the interest on client funds is going to be back-end loaded, but at the same time, we've got Pays Per Control being modeled up 2% to 3% even though people are starting to call for a potential recession and potentially a decline in employment. So I'm wondering how are you thinking about that part of the model and are there any things that you would call out with regards to this revenue trends as we build out the models for the coming year?

A - Don Mcguire{BIO 20657090 <GO>}
Thanks Mark, just going back to the first part of your question. You mentioned the deceleration of margin that I mentioned and, of course, we talked about the increase in sales headcount specifically because it is meaningful to quarter one of this year to quarter one of '22. So, we do think that's going to have a bit of a drag. There are, of, course, some other factors general inflation, et cetera, but and we've taken price Carlos described and took you through our price thinking, which is pretty consistent to what we've discussed over the last number of quarters. So, we do expect to see a little bit of deterioration in margin percentage through the first quarter. I think that's understood.

And then as interest rates go higher and as we have the opportunity, we're going to see higher client fund interest towards the last three quarters of the year, but overall, we're kind of looking at pretty even top line revenue quarter-by-quarter through the balance of the year. No big changes at all in terms of growth rates quarter-by-quarter through '23 compared to '22. So for modeling, growth needs to be pretty comfortable to the model consistent growth across the top lines quarter-by-quarter.

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
And it doesn't mean that you should model or that we modeled everything consistently throughout the quarters because I do have to make a comment on your point that it sounded like you thought we were being aggressive, which would not be typical of us to model 2% to 3% Pays Per Control when everyone's thinking there's going to be a recession. I would tell you that the fourth quarter you saw what our Pays Per Control growth was and I can tell you that we have visibility into July and it's hard to believe that for the whole year it would be less than 2% to 3%, but then you can assume that if for example, the first couple of months, at least, because we have some visibility of that already are in the 6% to 7% range, because that's where we're kind of exiting, and you can do the math right? You probably -- this is just to give you a color in terms of what some of our assumptions in our operating plan because I think Don mentioned maybe a bit of conservatism on the back half. We probably have reasonable continuation of trend because that's the way trends go on Pays Per Control in the first half and then you probably expect the second half of the year to have little to no Pays Per Control growth or somewhere in that neighborhood. It's also hard for us to model a big negative growth in Pays Per Control just because of all the factors we mentioned in the labor market. That doesn't mean that won't happen in '24 or late in '23 year or at some point in history, but it doesn't seem likely over the course of our fiscal year, but we're clearly expecting some slowdown in the second half.

Q - Mark Marcon{BIO 1750332 <GO>}
Carlos, you read my mind in terms of just the way I was thinking about the characterization and then thinking like okay, this is probably what you're thinking in terms of the way it's going to fall. So that's directly in line.

Hey, can I just ask one more question, just on Workforce Now, would you expect Next-Gen Payroll? What's the expectation in terms of the number of clients that would have Next-Gen Payroll within the Workforce Now contingent by the end of the year?

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
In terms of new business bookings, because obviously -- I make sure we answer the question correctly, it will only affect obviously, we're not even talking about migrations yet even though at some point that will have.

Q - Mark Marcon{BIO 1750332 <GO>}

Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal, with Barclays. Your line is open.

Q - Ramsey El-Assal{BIO 17528014 <GO>}
Hi there, thanks for taking my question today, I wanted to ask if you are seeing or expect to see any divergence in the kind of hiring or macro hiring environment, macro impact between the US and Europe? I guess the broader question is does your guidance assume a tougher environment in Europe relative to the US or something similar?

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
Don probably has the detail, but I can give you some high level color that Pays Per Control growth and I mean you're not asking about historical as we go to the data that I just want to tell you that Pays Per Control growth is very strong in Employer Services International as well and part of that, of course, is because of what we're coming off of, right, which these lockdowns and high unemployment rates across the globe. So, I'd say international has performed similarly, but it is safe to assume that we see probably challenges given what's happening in the macro environment with energy costs and the war and so forth in our international business. I don't know, Don. If you have?

A - Don Mcguire{BIO 20657090 <GO>}
No, Carlos. I think those points are valid certainly that what happens with energy on the cost and in particular is going to have some could have some impact on the results, but beyond that, this is a little bit of a conundrum that we talked about earlier, but where we are versus what people are talking about. So, as much as everyone's predicting a recession, et cetera, unemployment rates in the Eurozone are 6.1%, which is all-time low, unemployment rates in Canada are as low as they were even before I started working in 1974, unemployment rates Australia 50-year low. So, if we've got this situation where there seems to be a lot of employment, we have all this risk and worry about about recession.

So, although, to come back to your question, I would be a little bit more concerned about what could happen in EMEA in particular as a result of what's going on with the current crisis, et cetera. a little bit more concerned, yes. Did we think about that we put our plans together? to some extent, yes.

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
Don, you just point out that you started working in 1974 when you were 12 years old.

A - Don Mcguire{BIO 20657090 <GO>}
Well, I say, (inaudible).

Q - Ramsey El-Assal{BIO 17528014 <GO>}
That's very helpful. A follow-up question, just update us on M&A, capital allocation. Are you shifting your approach at all or you're seeing incremental opportunity out there given the turmoil evaluations in the marketplace, potential acquisition targets or is it just sort of steady as she goes in terms of no change?

A - Don Mcguire{BIO 20657090 <GO>}
Yeah, I think for now, it's pretty much steady as she goes, I mean certainly, you can see the valuations have dropped across the board. Things that were really expensive in January are still just expensive. Things are still expensive, come down off of historic highs. So, there is not exactly what I would call a bunch of bargains up there. There is also not a lot of people who are coming forward, looking to sell the properties because prices are down. So, I would say it's steady as she goes and we'll continue to do what we've done and look for things that worked for us strategically, look for adjacencies that makes sense for their eyes, but really steady as she goes, really no change to our overall policy.

Our next question comes from David Togut, with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.

Q - David Togut{BIO 1496355 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning. Don, you called out a 260 basis point margin increase in PEO year-over-year, in part driven by a favorable workers' compensation reserve adjustment. How much was that adjustment and how should we think about this item for fiscal '23?

A - Don Mcguire{BIO 20657090 <GO>}
Yeah, so I guess the short answer is we get adjustments under on a regular basis and they have been favorable for us. We look at the workers' compensation experience over a number of years. We get external third parties to do an assessment as to whether not it is appropriate to book any of those adjustments and this year we've been fortunate. We don't typically forecast those numbers in any greater detail simply because we do have to rely on the experience rating that the insurance companies bring to us and so without trying to disclose exactly what the numbers were I would say they are favorable and we'll have to wait as the months go by to see what's going to happen in '23.

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
I mean we're disclosing it in our 10-K. So we can--

A - Don Mcguire{BIO 20657090 <GO>}
It was $40 million for the quarter, David, in the K, and that compares to last year's, about $5 million, and most of that was as we headed into quarter in the forecast and guidance. So, it wasn't a big departure from what we had expected.

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
But I think what Don is trying to say though about '23 is that it is clearly a headwind, right? So, as you going to do your modeling and you think about margins, it's a headwind, not because there's an operating performance issue (inaudible) just because we had a big benefit in '22 and we're not planning for a big benefit in '23, although we're always hopeful that we will get some some benefit that's historically been our experience is that we do get some quote unquote reserve that is probably not as big in '23 as in '22, but it may not be as bigger headwind as it appears now just because of the numbers.

Q - David Togut{BIO 1496355 <GO>}
I appreciate that. Just as a quick follow-up. Don, in the guidance you've given for extended investment strategy client fund interest to be up about $200 million to $220 million year-over-year in fiscal '23. How should we think about the incremental margin on that additional revenue, are you applying additional expenses against it or should we think about it flowing through at some set margin?

A - Don Mcguire{BIO 20657090 <GO>}
Yeah. So, I think there's other things going on of course, we mentioned the inflationary environment, which is why we have the higher interest rates. We mentioned the FX headwinds we have. So, all things in, we're still expecting (inaudible). We're happy and very proud of the operating margin improvements we are getting. We think we still have good opportunity for margin improvements, (inaudible) client fund interest going forward.

So, I'd say that right now our expectations are for a pretty balanced incremental margin from both of those factors. So, we are, of course, as we mentioned, we are spending some more money, we're investing in sales headcount. We have higher costs as a result of inflation and some of it is offset by price. We are letting a substantial amount for the bottom line, but we are obviously in this for the long term. So, we will take the opportunity to invest in the business and make sure that we have the right balance between margin growth and preparing ourselves for continued success in the future years.

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
But I think that stream of revenue -- we would generally see it as a 100% margin, just to be completely clear. If that is the question, if we apply expenses against those revenues, then the answer is -- it felt like a trick question because you've noticed for a long time we've been clear for a long -- like on the way down, we always say it's 100%, it hurts us, right, because there's really no expense that go away when that Interest income goes away. So, likewise, we would want to be transparent and acknowledge that on the way up, it's a 100% margin, but I wasn't sure if it was a trick question or sounds like it was.

Q - David Togut{BIO 1496355 <GO>}
No, I was just trying to understand how much of that incremental revenue would flow through to the bottom line since Don had talked a lot about investment initiatives and you had underscored growth in sales force headcount, but thank you so much. Very responsive. I appreciate it.

A - Don Mcguire{BIO 20657090 <GO>}
And David, I'll just add one clarification, you said, incremental revenue. We did make the point in the prepared remarks that it's the net impact of the portfolio that would be 100% incremental margin. So, there is a cost offset and it is the short-term borrowing costs associated with the portfolio strategy.

Q - David Togut{BIO 1496355 <GO>}
Much appreciate it. Thank you.

We have time for one more question and that question comes from Samad Samana, with Jefferies. Your line is open.

Q - Samad Samana{BIO 17883999 <GO>}
Hi. Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to maybe circle back on the price increases. I know that inflation is a big driver of maybe more than normal amount. Can you just maybe help us understand, would that put the Company back on track if I think about the pause and increases in maybe fiscal '21 during COVID? would it be kind of linear from pre-COVID levels if we just thought about the price increases compounding or would it put you ahead of that because of inflation? And Carlos, can you just remind us, do those price increases tend to stick if inflation starts to roll over?

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
Yeah, I think again strategically maybe Danny and Don can give more specifics on the numbers, but I wouldn't characterize what we did as being out of step with the market or there was a pause for a few months, but our price increases. Our intention was that our price increases during COVID were reflective of the inflation environment at that time as well. We did pause for a few months because timing-wise, we just thought particularly in 2020 that it was inappropriate to be giving clients price increases one or two months into a global pandemic, but we eventually did some price increases, but we did very modest price increases because inflation was near zero for some period of time.

So I don't know if that answers it, I'm trying to be responsive, but I think in general we are always trying to remain kind of in step with the market and still be competitive because our number one goal is to gain market share and what the trap that is easy to fall into when you're a large Company like ours is you can take price and take it higher, then maybe you can usually do that multiple times and you can do that for a while, but it just doesn't work forever because of just the law of economics and large numbers and because of competition, and so our intention, it's important to understand the strategically, is we want to grow and we want to gain market share and to do that we have to be competitive in terms of our products, our service, and also our price and so it's important when we do price pricing actions, either on new business on our existing book of business that we remain in line with what with what's happening in the general market and with our competitors.

A - Carlos A. Rodriguez{BIO 15143503 <GO>}
Thank you. I think we were very happy with the quarter, as we said. I'm not sure what else I can say other than what I said about our sales performance, which I think is definitely the best I've seen in a long time, and we talked a lot about our retention and some of the structural issues that are happening there. So it's hard to be more pleased about that, but I do want to reiterate again how happy we are with our organization and our team. First we start with COVID and all the uncertainty that created everybody having to work from home, then we have all these regulatory changes, some of them very positive like the PPP loans, the ERTC that happened across the world. And while we're then in the middle of the pandemic, we are telling our associates that they got to work weekends and nice because we got to keep up with all of these regulatory changes and we've got to help our clients and then as soon as that starts to abate a little bit, we get this great reshuffling. We start having challenges which we overcame in terms of being able to add the staffing and so we asked our associates to once again work harder, putting the extra effort and every time we've asked, they've come through for us and they come through more importantly for our clients.

We really do provide critical services across the world to our clients and it was very, very important for our organization to come through for our clients, and I just want to again thank our our associates for making it through so many ups and downs, where we just keep asking for a little bit more and they keep delivering. So I want to thank them once again to your attention and your interest and the great questions and we look forward to talking again in the next quarter. Thank you.
