Operator
Welcome to the Third Quarter 2022 Arista Networks Financial Results Earnings Conference Call. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call.

Ms.Liz Stine, Arista's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.

Liz Stine{BIO 22543302 <GO>}
Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer.

This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter ending September 30, 2022. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our website.

During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of the 2022 fiscal year, longer term financial outlook for 2022 and beyond, our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, supply chain constraints, component costs, manufacturing capacity, inventory purchases and inflationary pressures on our business, the potential impact of COVID-19, extended lead times, product innovation and the benefits of acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call.

Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release.

With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree.

Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Thank you, Liz. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our third quarter 2022 earnings call. We delivered record revenues of $1.17 billion for the quarter with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.25. Services and software support renewals contributed approximately 16.3% of the revenue.

Our non-GAAP gross margins of 61.2% was pressured by escalated cost due to supply chain as well as a substantially higher cloud titan mix. We expect some of these trends to continue into 2023. Cloud titan was our largest vertical, followed by enterprise and then cloud specialty providers, financials, and finally service providers.

International contribution was at 17%, with the Americas at 83%, once again reflecting stronger cloud customer influence. Our Q3 2022 results reinforce Arista's customer relevance in both cloud titan and specialty cloud providers.

I would like to invite Anshul Sadana, our Chief Operating Officer and Cloud czar [ph] to shed some light on this.

Anshul Sadana{BIO 16683800 <GO>}
Thank you, Jayshree. Our partnership with the cloud titans and specialty providers keeps getting stronger. While supply chain got most of the attention for the last two years, we have achieved several technical milestones with our customers during this period, taking our products from labs to pilot to high-volume deployments.

We are successfully deployed in more use cases than before, including the leaf-spine cluster designs, data center white spines, data center interconnects, backbone, WAN and edge. Our customers have a deep appreciation of our expertise and execution.

The titans starting with Microsoft and Meta are continuing with their 400-gig journey. They're using our latest fixed and de-buffer modular 400-gig switches in these new deployments. We're continuing to expand our use cases with the other titans too. While they are relatively smaller, these partnerships are healthy and continuing to grow as well.

The specialty cloud providers are continuing to grow, too. They have very similar leaf-spine designs but with smaller clusters, and they too, have the same DCI and regional designs, just fewer ports. We are in a competitive industry and our customers like some diversity. However, we are very well positioned to maintain and grow our share given our quality, execution and strong partnerships.

Back to you, Jayshree.

Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Thanks, Anshul. We are experiencing one of our best ever cloud titan growth and revenue this year since IPO. Therefore, we expect north of 45% contribution in 2022 from this category with a diversified product portfolio and use cases as you heard from Anshul.

Speaking of new products, Arista introduced the next phase of routing this quarter in Q3. Arista's cloud grade routing platform powered by extensible operating system, EOS, and our network data lake, NetDL, is built on a consistent architectural foundation for multiple routing use cases, such as clearing, content delivery, networks, cloud connect, enterprise edge, mobile and metro edge, as well as carrier core. We have successfully transformed legacy routers to modern routing.

For our customer securing data in transit, Arista's innovative TunnelSEC technology provides in line encryption at wire speed from 10-gig, all the way up to 400-gig, eliminating the performance bottleneck of traditional encryption. Arista's latest R3 series routing portfolio continues to deliver for our adjacent market sector that we began six years ago.

As I mentioned previously, our customer momentum continues. Our $1 million logos have doubled in the last three years, and Arista's market share in 100-gig, 200-gig, and 400-gig port clients, placing us at a number one market leader position according to many industry analysts.

Let me illustrate with a few customer wins this year. The recurring theme to remember is that Arista is diversifying its business with many use cases such as data center, campus, routing, cloud and edge based all on cloud principles. Our first enterprise win highlights the ever-growing strength of a single solution for diverse use cases in the data center, in the campus and in data center interconnect routing.

Based on industry standards and monitoring capabilities with Arista's DANZ Monitoring Fabric, or DMF, Arista was uniquely positioned to provide a single EOS binary code version using CloudVision and our NetDL stack. The next is an international Americas win in the financial sector, providing secure data center solutions, Arista's competitive advantage was twofold. First, our single EOS stack provided reassurance that they could handle security patches, bug patches, new software code upgrades with zero downtime, much better than our peers in the industry. Also, we can do much better automation.

Traditionally, it used to take customers several months, if not years to go live with a single data center with their incumbent vendor. Arista's programmatic API's continuous integration validation with DevOps integration was deployed across multiple data centers within just a few days with no human intervention or errors, offering the lowest total cost of ownership.

Our third customer [ph] win demonstrates our strength in campus in the healthcare sector. This customer was looking to upgrade its legacy infrastructure in multiple hospital locations and moving more to a cloud operated model. Arista provided that cloud managed network offering across the data center campus and cognitive Wi-Fi, and also WAN Edge and internet edge. The single pane of glass offers real-time network-as-a-service with visibility, health checks, troubleshooting and provisioning to the client, all the way to campus and to the cloud infrastructure.

The next international win shows our continuing presence in the public sector. This customer wanted to move to a 100-gigabit Ethernet using Arista's Spine and Spline platforms to connect into incumbent DWDM, Edge and load balances for massive route scale.

Arista's advantage was the lowest software security vulnerabilities over a nine-year period compared to alternatives that were significantly higher. This, by the way, also applied to Arista's cognitive WiFi with zero vulnerabilities. Our final win emphasizes Arista's ability to provide encryption as a part of a secure routing solution.

This was an international Tier 2 service provider, whereby Arista delivered full line rate data in transit for the customers' remote sites. This bespoke design encompasses Layer 3 virtual private network, VPN, over VXLAN routing solutions with macro segmentation based on access less and direct flow rules, all managed by CloudVision.

Overall, you could see that Arista continues to gain customer relevance in market share and building our vision for a client to cloud network. The promise of not only delivering on superior technology but the ability to help our customers realize the operational benefits be a world-class quality, support, services is a real compelling advantage. We look forward to sharing more of our vision and strategy at our Analyst Day, this Thursday, November 3, 2022.

Now, I will turn over to Ita for our financial specifics.

Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q3 results and our guidance for Q4 2022 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q3 were $1.177 billion, up 57.2% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance range of $1.025 billion to $1.075 billion.

Overall demand for our products remains healthy across all areas of the business. Supply challenges continued throughout the quarter with ongoing supplier decommits constraining shipments and requiring higher-cost broker purchases and expedite fees.

Services and subscription software contributed approximately 16.3% of revenue in the third quarter, down from 17.6% in Q2. This largely reflected accelerated growth in product revenues, while services and software continued to grow on a more consistent basis.

International revenues for the quarter came in at $199.1 million or 17% of total revenue, down from 20% in the second quarter. This reflected strength in U.S. revenues in the period and particularly with our larger cloud customers. Overall gross margin in Q3 was 61.2%, just above the midpoint of our guidance range of 60% to 62%. As previously discussed, our current lower gross margin ranges reflect a healthy cloud mix and higher levels of broker component sourcing and expedite fees.

Operating expenses for the period were mostly flat to last quarter at $227.7 million or 19.3% of revenue. R&D spending came in at $150.1 million or 12.8% of revenue, up from last quarter at $148 million. This primarily reflected increased headcount costs in the period with slightly lower new product introduction costs.

Sales and marketing expense was $62.8 million or 5.3% of revenue and G&A costs were $14.7 million or 1.3% of revenue, both mostly consistent with last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was $492.1 million or 41.8% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $6.1 million and our effective tax rate was approximately 21.3%.

This resulted in net income for the quarter of $391.9 million or 33.3% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 314.4 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $1.25, up approximately 69% from the prior year.

Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $2.98 billion. We repurchased $47.6 million of our common stock during the third quarter at an average price of approximately $99 per share. As a reminder, we've now repurchased approximately $740 million or 7 million shares against our October 2021, $1 billion Board authorization.

The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, business requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors.

Now, turning to our operating cash performance for the third quarter. We generated $134.1 million of cash from operations in the quarter, reflecting strong earnings performance, somewhat offset by increased working capital investments. Increases in inventory and other assets are mainly driven by receipt of components for future shipments, including shipments delayed due to supplier decommits. This trend should reverse once overall supply conditions for these decommitted components improve.

DSOs came in at 51 days, flat to last quarter. Inventory turns were 1.7x, down from 1.9x in the prior quarter. Inventory increased to $1.1 billion in the quarter, up from $852.8 million in the prior period, reflecting higher components and peripherals inventory and an increase in switch related finished goods in transition.

Our purchase commitment number for the quarter was $4.3 billion, down from $4.5 billion in Q2. These multi-year purchase commitments reflect overall strength and demand and the current long lead time supply environment. As a reminder, we continue to prioritize newer early life cycle products for inclusion in these strategies, in order to help mitigate the risk of excess or obsolescence.

Our total deferred revenue balance was $941 million, down from $1 billion in Q2. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis.

Approximately $165 million of the balance, down from $228 million last quarter, represents product deferred revenue largely related to customer specific acceptance clauses for new products with our larger customers. Accounts payable days where 56 days, down from 63 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.4 million.

Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We came into the year calling for 30% year-over-year revenue growth, somewhat balanced across our market sectors and heavily constrained by supply. We now expect revenue growth for the year of approximately 45% at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance with a healthy contribution coming from our cloud titan customers in what has remained a stubbornly constrained supply environment.

Our cloud titan customers are now expected to account for approximately 45% of our revenue for the year with major contributions from Meta and Microsoft. Demand from our enterprise and provider businesses has also been strong, exceeding our original expectations from a demand perspective, but with revenue somewhat constrained by supply.

We expect gross margin pressure to continue in the quarter with some continued need for broker purchases and expedite fees in response to ad hoc supplier decommits combined with a healthy cloud mix. Even allowing for the lower gross margins, we expect healthy operating margins for the quarter, again demonstrating the resiliency of the business model with significant bottom line flow-through from increased revenue scale.

With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the fourth quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows: Revenues of approximately $1.175 billion to $1.2 billion; gross margin of approximately 60% to 62%, operating margin of approximately 40%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 21.5% with diluted shares on a post-split basis of approximately 316 million shares.

I will now turn the call back to Liz. Liz?

Liz Stine{BIO 22543302 <GO>}

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)

We will now begin the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. (Operator Instructions) Your first question today comes from the line of Tim long with Barclays. Your line is now open.

Q - Tim Long{BIO 17361522 <GO>}
Thank you. Yeah, I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about kind of the enterprise and campus strategy. Obviously, you guys have been growing pretty well there. If you could kind of update the $400 million bogie for the year. And, you've mentioned (Technical Difficulty)

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Oh, we lost him. Tim, are you there?

Q - Tim Long{BIO 17361522 <GO>}
(inaudible)

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Put your audio -- Tim, you're sounding muffled. Why don't -- I think, I'll interpret your question, Tim, even though I'd only heard half of it which is, what is your status on campus and enterprise strategy and how are you doing to the $400 million target?

Obviously, we'll get back to you when we've completed the year. But at this point, we would say that the strength of our campus business from an orders perspective is very strong and we (Technical Difficulty) $400 million. We are very supply-constrained. So we're not yet sure if we will hit the $400 million from a revenue and shipment perspective.

Q - Tim Long{BIO 17361522 <GO>}
I'm sorry. If you could just touch on the wireless LAN contribution, it sounds like that's doing a little bit better now. Sorry about that, I was muffled a little.

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Yeah. No, we are very pleased with our wireless LAN contribution. If you think back, we acquired Mojo Networks in 2018 - late 2018, early 2019, and it was a very small single-digit business. And we expect the wireless LAN contribution to become a triple-digit business next year.

A - Liz Stine{BIO 22543302 <GO>}
Thank you, Tim.

Q - Tim Long{BIO 17361522 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is now open.

Q - Alex Henderson{BIO 1498629 <GO>}
Great. Spectacular results for the quarter, for the year compared [ph] to the results last year. And I guess the question really boils down to, are we going to see a reversion to more normalized growth? And if that happens, does that bring the margins back into the 37% range? And have we set ourselves up against extremely difficult comps as we go into 2023?

How do we think about the mechanics of where we are alternatively? Clearly, supply constraints persist. You sound more constrained than you had earlier, and that would imply to me that at least for the first half of next year or even longer, you might still be in the strong growth trajectory. Can you just address how we should be thinking about the environment as we move forward? Thanks.

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Alex, thank you for the kind words. And I'll tee it up and certainly let Ita speak to some of the details you are asking about. First of all, I just want to say I'm very proud of the team for executing. As you know, we came into the area expecting 30% growth, and here we are telling you it's going to be 45%. So, a huge contribution from Anshul and the team not only on the Cloud Titans, but also on the Enterprise and rest of the cloud business as we call it led by Chris Schmidt and Ashwin. Lot to be proud of especially as the numbers get larger.

So as you think about the numbers getting larger, it's going to be difficult to sustain 45% growth every year. I'd love to have it, but as you know Arista is a volatile business, and you have to think of us across a three to five-year CAGR not just on an annual basis. So, I still think we have a large TAM, we're going to do very well. But, with a looming uncertainty of recession and CapEx spend, et cetera, it's definitely difficult to predict beyond a year.

Having said that, I think, as I said before, we're having one of our best ever years in 2022, and even though the comps will be difficult, we feel confident that if supply chain gives us some relief, we can do well in 2023 as well.

Ita, would you like to add anything? (Multiple Speakers)

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
Yeah. I think, Alex, if you go back to the business model, Obviously, the gross margin kind of variability that we see that's kind of inherent to the business model is to do with the mix of the business, right? And that kind of works very nicely when you see accelerated cloud, you see that flow through to the operating margin line even though it might be impacting the gross margin in that time period, right?

As we talk next Thursday, we'll talk some more about kind of what the growth rates look like for next year and kind of how that flows through the model. But there's no doubt that when we accelerate growth like this, it's hard for us to accelerate spending in the same rate and you never really kind of catch up for that, right?

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
And it's one to be proud of.

Q - Alex Henderson{BIO 1498629 <GO>}
Thanks so much.

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
Thanks, Alex.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is now open.

Q - Paul Silverstein{BIO 1812254 <GO>}
So I guess, I shouldn't ask you what everybody wants to know which is, what's your outlook for next year?

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
You wait a couple more days, Paul, just a couple more days.

Q - Paul Silverstein{BIO 1812254 <GO>}
All right. I had to ask as everybody else is asking. So, it's sure doesn't sound like from the numbers that macro had much if any impacts, but F5 last week did identify macro as a meaningful driver of a very disappointing outlook. Any thoughts you can share in terms of what you're seeing? Is it affecting one iota customer decisions as to your products and solutions? Any thoughts would be appreciated.

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Look, I think -- I don't think of Arista as a bellwether for macro. So, we'll let the pundits on economists speak about that. But, I think it's fair to say that data centers spend has been very strong, and we're confident of our near-term strength both in cloud titans, enterprise and campus.

If there's a place that we see some softening at all, geographically, I would point to Europe. They've had effect of the pandemic, the energy crisis, the war, the Brexit. It's just a whole lot of things going on there. But, our numbers are small. And even there, I would say it's more enough to execute better. So overall, macro is not yet an issue for us. We'll keep a vigilant eye on it, but so far, so good.

Q - Paul Silverstein{BIO 1812254 <GO>}
Jayshree, just to be clear, you're not seeing elongated sale cycles, you're not seeing cutbacks, deferrals or cancelations to any appreciable extent in orders especially from enterprise. I appreciate that you're small, but your enterprise is nothing, it's a growing business. And correct me if I'm wrong, but historically, in times of economic duress, most organizations have declined to change vendors or put-off changes in their infrastructure that would result in bringing a new vendor like yourself?

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Right. I don't think Arista is anymore a new vendor. I think we are the best of breed vendor. And what we see especially in networking unlikely maybe -

Q - Paul Silverstein{BIO 1812254 <GO>}
Non-incumbent.

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Yeah. Fair point. We're not a legacy vendor just yet. I would say if anything, Paul, just to answer your question more directly, unlike server or storage, networking is a very, very strategic spend. There's a long qualification cycle that goes in, there's proof-of-concept labs, there's intense testing for scale. And we're all struggling with lead times. So, switching vendors doesn't give you any particular advantage. And if you're looking for best of breed and best operational advantages, the -- our customers would prefer to wait for us. So, of course, we don't want to test their patience. We're going to do everything we can to execute. You're seeing that in our purchase commitment. But we got to execute even better.

Q - Paul Silverstein{BIO 1812254 <GO>}
All right. Appreciate the response. Thank you.

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open.

Q - Simon Leopold{BIO 4081594 <GO>}
Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to get a little bit of help understanding how to think about the purchase order commitments. Just looking at the prior 10-Q filing, you had a 12-month commitment of like $2.9 billion, and you mentioned today that the overall commitment came down a little bit to $4.3 billion. But, what I'm struggling with is, if we just sort of try to back into implied revenue, it's well above what most of the street is modeling for the next year. And there're a number of ways that we could think about it. You could either write-off inventory, you could hold higher inventory levels, or certainly you could have much higher revenue than we expect. I'm wondering if you could give us some advice on how to interpret these purchase order commitment? Thank you.

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
Yeah. Simon, I think the -- obviously, the goal is to make the purchase commitments that we need to support the business. But, it is multi-year, right? And we are thinking about this kind of longer-term than just the year that's ahead, right? So that's why you're seeing the numbers kind of not mapped perfectly to whatever your revenue assumption is for just for 2023, right? So, we'll -- again, we'll talk about 2023 and the growth rates when we get to the Analyst Day, and then maybe you can ask this question again, and we'll try to provide some more guidance.

But, it really is about being multi-year and some of these products are early-stage products where we believe we can put (Technical Difficulty) so that there's a limited risk in terms of E&O and reserves and really you're tying up cash, but that's kind of -- that's worth it in terms of being able to have the products and have the components in place when we need them.

Q - Simon Leopold{BIO 4081594 <GO>}
Thank you.

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
Thanks, Simon.

Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.

Q - Meta Marshall{BIO 18728692 <GO>}
Great. Thanks. Ita and Jayshree, maybe if you could just comment on whether some of the upside that you're seeing from the cloud titans this year is due to kind of greater ability to serve them and get them more product than they wanted or if you're actually getting kind of stronger orders than expected? And just kind of on the deferred revenue being recognized, if there are projects that are kind of changing and timing that led to kind of the stronger than expected results? Thanks.

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Thanks, Meta. So I think it's fair to say, as Anshul has often said that our relationship and partnership with the cloud titan continues to be strong and couldn't be better, especially with Microsoft and Meta, who we fully expect to be greater than 10% concentration. I wish we could ship them more. And I think if they were hearing this call, they would be saying, I wish you could ship us more too. So I don't think it is a case of shipping them more. I think it's a case of demand from them and a very strategic partnership at the engineering level, at the network design level, at the operational level, at the procurement level and actually Anshul, I'd like you to, since you're dealing with this daily, say some more.

A - Anshul Sadana{BIO 16683800 <GO>}
Absolutely. Meta, the demand from these customers is just strong. Yes, there's some timing of revenue and deferred and so on, but that's not what's leading into their strength. The raw demand from these customers continue to be strong. They want to do more build-outs. If you look at how many data centers and regions they want to build out, it's very strong. If you look at their DCI ads with 400-gig and 100-kilometer type of distances, building big regions, that's very, very strong. And they love our execution. As Jayshree mentioned, if they could get them more product, they would happily take it as well. So all in all, a phenomenal outcome compared to where we were two years ago, but in a very healthy cycle with our cloud customers.

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
And Meta, on the deferred, I mean it's a nothing for the year now stage, right? If you look at it year-to-date, really the deferred is not a contributor at all at this point.

Q - Meta Marshall{BIO 18728692 <GO>}
All right. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.

Q - Ben Bollin{BIO 7475003 <GO>}
Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping we could talk a little bit about just the broader supply and demand balance. I'm sure, we'd all -- you included, would love to know when this ends. But I'm curious about how you're thinking about evolving from a supply perspective. When you think it maybe gets directionally better when it's really better? And then also curious how it's influencing the duration of visibility you're seeing from customers that has gotten longer. Is it still getting longer since starting to shrink? What are you seeing there? That's it from me. Thanks.

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Okay. Hey, Ben. I -- so, you asked really two questions. What's the direction of our visibility? Is it getting longer? Generally, right now, because of our lead times, our visibility is approximately six months to a year. And we've never had that kind of visibility particularly from our cloud providers. So directionally, it's not getting longer, but staying about the same is what I'd tell you.

And then what are we seeing on supply chain? And when is it going to get better? Gosh, we -- one of the reasons that Ita, Anshul and myself made such a concerted effort, we got Board approval for very large purchase commitments, multi-year despite a smaller revenue, is exactly not to be in the spot we are, which is we wanted to get all our components. But sadly, we have almost all the components except a handful. And you can't build a system without the last few components. So, we do have still some severe shortages as I said before. We expect this to go into 2023. And I think our long lead times would persist in the industry, for networking especially, for the next several months and for 2023. So, we don't see a lot of relief in sight until we can get all the components. Being short of a few components still means we can't build a system. So expect us -- it's improving, but expect us to really only see improvement a year from now.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.

Q - Matt Niknam{BIO 21568441 <GO>}
Hey, thank you so much for taking the question. On the guide for the non-GAAP op income margin, so I think you did 42-ish percent this quarter. I know the guide talks about a nearly 200 basis points step down despite stable gross margins. I'm just wondering if you can talk about where you see opportunity for incremental investment? And then if I could just sneak in one follow-up on the deferred revenue question, so it looks like deferred has dipped about -- deferred revenue dipped about $92 million sequentially. I'm just wondering what's baked into the revenue outlook for 4Q from a deferred perspective? Thanks.

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
Yeah. So, on the deferred, the product deferred decline in Q3 is about $60 million. So, there's a piece of it that's just services, service contract timing and stuff in there. So really the thing that's kind of directly linked to the revenue is about $60 million. For Q4, and the guide we're assuming no deferred, right -- a no deferred impact, right. So, that's that question.

And then the other question was all the expenses -- yeah, the expenses and operating margin. I think look, we were flat pretty much on OpEx in Q3. Some of that is timing. That wasn't the original plan obviously. So some of that will recover and some -- as we head into Q4, we'll see some sales commissions and other things at the back end of the year tend to be a little higher as well, right? So it's kind of a combination of maybe some timing and then just a normal kind of Q4 dynamics.

Q - Fahad Najam{BIO 18889220 <GO>}
Thank you for taking my question. Jayshree, I think at a recent investor conference, you said that you think the industry can grow double-digit revenue. If I recall, you said, you were connecting clouds of data or centers of data. So, I want to understand your response to a previous question that is, does supply chain improve next year, you would do well, well versus what, that double-digit outlook that you had earlier, is that what you're thinking? Just can help us understand?

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Yes, Fahad, I'll try. I think in terms of demand, we fully expected to grow double digits next year and I hope for years to come unless there's some real macro issues. Specific to next year, again, we will guide specifically at Analyst Day, but I think if supply chain were to be relieved, we will grow double-digits. If supply chain continues to be constrained, we'll still grow double-digits. So either way, I'm (inaudible) do well next year.

Q - Fahad Najam{BIO 18889220 <GO>}
I have one follow-up.

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
It's a question of how well.

Q - Fahad Najam{BIO 18889220 <GO>}
What's the risk of your cloud customers having some level of inventory build-up? I understand that there is a significant constraint on networking equipment, but there is big evidence of inventory mismatches in the server and storage space at some other cloud titan. And so, what's the risk that there will be a mismatch (inaudible)?

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Very little, Fahad. I think it's important to understand that nobody has been in a position to have any kind of inventory or networking. Anshul, you want to add to that?

A - Anshul Sadana{BIO 16683800 <GO>}

Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.

Q - Ittai Kidron{BIO 5557426 <GO>}
Thanks, ladies, and great quarter. I guess a couple questions. Jayshree, you talked about your activity was to cloud guys and how the cloud guys do want diversity in suppliers. And of course, there's always timing in projects where you kind of run ahead or below where you probably should be just given the timing of projects. Do you get a sense right now on if you're punching above or below your weight kind of -- and I'm calling weight, whatever the cloud guys really think you should be at long-term from a share standpoint?

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Yeah. That's a -- hey, welcome back, Ittai. We haven't chatted in a long time. That's a really good question. You had to ask a tough one. I do think we're punching at our weight; in terms of demand, even above our weight; in terms of actually supplying, maybe below our weight. But not -- by the way, I'm only talk about the cloud guys, not myself. Anshul, you want to add to that?

A - Anshul Sadana{BIO 16683800 <GO>}
Well, I'm not there to a referee boxing match. But in terms of supply and overall demand, Ittai, customers like to diversify. I think most customers have already set their plans. It's -- we're not expecting any big dramatic changes from here on. And we talked about for a couple of years now that customers truly like our product, they like our execution. The partnership is healthy. They were not worried because of claims from many companies on how they'll be ahead, and they will beat us and all of that. In the end, we've done really well. If someone takes a share in one of the roles, we take share in other roles too. So, as a result, because of the expansion in WAN and Edge and routing other use cases, we've done well, and our expectation is we'll actually continue to do well going forward as well.

Q - Ittai Kidron{BIO 5557426 <GO>}
Got it. Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, Jayshree, I mean you did talk about the weakness in Europe and it's obvious that there should be weakness over there. But your business over there is down on a year-over-year basis and I guess I'm kind of wondering the traction and the share gains that you're having at the U.S., one would think that even in the current environment, if you're able to get share gains in Europe as well, you'd still be able to eke growth out of there, maybe not 30-40%, but perhaps a 10%, 15%. So, help me understand what -- maybe you could go a layer deeper into what's going on in Europe. And do you think that the current environment may be going back to a previous question, Paul's question, that in this environment, perhaps customers are just less likely to consider change than just stick with what they've got and maybe that's a hindering element?

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
No, I don't. I was answering the question, Ittai, more on, is there a recession. In a broad sense, if at all -- we are generally seeing very strong demand worldwide. If at all we are seeing some softness in weakness, it would be in parts of Europe, because of all that they're going through. Specific to Arista, I see no reason we shouldn't be growing everywhere, including Europe. But our rate of growth in Europe maybe slower for exactly the reasons you mentioned that their overall economy, if you look at the GDP and if you look at the top three countries, Germany, UK, and France, none of them are really substantially investing. So I think because we have small numbers, we can do fine. We should be able to still grow double digits, but that is the only sign of recession we're so far seeing.

Q - Ittai Kidron{BIO 5557426 <GO>}
Got it. Very good. Good luck. Thanks.

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}

Okay. All right.

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}

Okay. Well, maybe Ita, on that point, did the U.S. grow? Can you tell us how much the U.S. grew without the titans?

Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Your line is now open.

Q - David Vogt{BIO 21761779 <GO>}
Thanks, guys, for taking the question. I just want to go back to the margin performance. If I go back to 2019, I think your titan mix was relatively similar to where we are today, maybe a little bit less, but your gross margins were almost 300 -- and your product gross margins were almost 300 basis points higher. So, can we kind of disaggregate that delta? How much of that is from expedited freight supply chain versus maybe somewhat structurally lower margins with some of the new titans and/or Microsoft and Meta?

And then on OpEx, just a quick question, growth has been 15% to 20% sort of on a year-over-year basis. Is that kind of how we should think about the business as we progress over a couple of years cycle? Thanks.

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
Yeah, I think on the gross margin piece, I mean, there is more cloud mix in the business I think that we've seen.

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Than we've even seen. This is the highest mix we've ever had.

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
But we also have -- remember, don't forget the expediting fees and stuff we've talked about the 200 to 300 basis points. I mean that is still there. I think that will be there for a while certainly in our Q4 guide. So I think it's a combination of those 2, right?

When you think back in that time period, you could run the business for costs, right? And we were optimizing costs in every way. Today, we're kind of hamstrung because of supply -- so it's inefficient right now, to be honest, right, particularly with these decommits.

So we need to get out of that, and then we can kind of start to drive for some improvements on the gross margin side as well. I think on the OpEx side, if you look back historically, we've probably been in the 20%, 22% growth type range on OpEx except in times of disruption, right? So I mean, that's probably not a bad way to think about it.

Q - David Vogt{BIO 21761779 <GO>}
Got it. And Ita, maybe just a quick follow-up. So it sounds like your structural margins on the titans are relatively unchanged over the last, call it, two to three years outside of the expedite fee and supply chain. Is that a fair characterization on the product side?

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
I think it depends on the product mix to some degree, right? I mean, you've got -- there's more -- you'd have to do more disaggregation to really get to what's happening there, right? But there's -- the product mix is a part of that as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is now open.

Q - Amit Daryanani{BIO 7113568 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the good quarter. I guess the question is we on the cloud titan side, and on a broader level of vertical, we're seeing an increased focus on profitability from the cloud company. And I'm just wondering, as they start to focus perhaps more of the resources on their own core competencies, could you see a lot of these cloud companies started to shift from building their own solution on the networking side versus starting to buy them more often. There's a lot to understand, a, from your existing customer base, are you seeing an expansion of engagement with them beyond what you've traditionally done? And then, b, more importantly, are you seeing newer customers come to you that want to start buying from you other than building it organically themselves?

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Okay. I'll take it, and thank you, Amit. I'll take it in two parts. The cloud titans have always had a combination of build and buy. So, I don't think that's changing. They continue to look at whether it's SONiC or FBOSS working closely with us. But in some layers, they are absolutely sourcing their own products and technology. At the same time, I think the cloud titans have to run very mission-critical networks. And they recognize the value and the partnership at an engineering level to not built themselves, but really co-develop with us. So, these I would say are not built or buy, they really co-develop partnerships where they get the best of both. And despite all of their focus on costs, believe me, they're getting their best of both, because they're getting great cost for us without making the direct investment themselves, and it really is a unique partnership.

Anshul, you want to say some more to that?

A - Anshul Sadana{BIO 16683800 <GO>}
Sure. Amit, in general, these cloud companies keep exploring every possible way to go faster. There's a misunderstanding in the entire -- but it's on the wall street sort of things sometimes people have said hey, people want to find something that's cheaper, because they can save money. The reality is they have to look at their total overall business impact and if they can go faster and get a competitive advantage, that's a huge benefit to them.

So, most of these companies do not build their own products or stacks just to build it cheaper, they build it because there's some secret sauce, there's some IP, there's some integration. That's what you're seeing with the co-development we do with Meta and Microsoft whether it's on the FBOSS, SONiC side or some of the hardware we develop as well. The other titans explore the same use cases or similar themes with us on an ongoing basis.

So, these are not new discussions to us. And I think we will continue to execute well. Clearly, the majority of the business continues to come from our top two customers. We are happy with that. The others are engaged as we touched on previously, but those are long running projects, but then to get to a decision point and actually impact, you have to wait several years and we will get there. But there is nothing that's changed in the industry. People are in general happy with the way status quo has been maintained with a little bit of let's explore other options in working with companies like us, where possible.

Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.

Q - Aaron Rakers{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations as well on the quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit more of a technical question. As we think about 400 gig and you think about the traction you are seeing with your cloud titans as well as some of the specialty cloud guys, I am just curious if you could level set us on where you think we are at in terms of the 400-gig cycle. And on that topic as well, any updated thoughts on this idea of the AI fabric networks, representing an incremental adjacent growth driver for your business at the cloud titans? Thank you.

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Unquestionably. I think while majority of the enterprise is still on 10 and 40, we are seeing more and more combinations of 100 gig and 400 gig, not only in the cloud titans, but also in the rest of the customer base. Just to level set on the numbers, you may recall that we had 70 or so customers in 2020. We doubled to 300 into 2021. And if I had to guess, I would say we double again in 2022 in terms of 400 gig customers. But the important thing to remember here is they are not just 400. There really are a permutation and combination of multiple speeds, multiple use cases. And together, they are an important contributor, but it's never an isolation 100. Some of them are uplinks. Some of them are native connections. Some of them, as Anshul alluded, are DCI routing solutions.

So, our market share in this combination of 100, 400 and in some cases, 200 is number one for a good reason, because they really have to work together with the right software and right management. The AI spine cluster is emerging as a new use case. It's still early days, and we've talked about it some. We will talk about it more at the Analyst Day, but more use case emergence for applications that really push the speed and latency and performance and predictable bandwidth of 400 gig is going to add additional fuel to our 400 gig demand.

Q - Jim Suva{BIO 6329522 <GO>}
Thank you. Jayshree and Ita, I noticed in your press release that you made a comment to new market expansion. Could you elaborate a little bit, like what is that or is that going to be a focus for the event on Thursday? Because I assume it's not just continual strength of where you're seeing or maybe it is. But if you can give any expansion on that, because I know in the past or currently, you've seen a lot of expansion in the campus growth. But I saw the new market expansion literally word for word, and I got to think there were some purpose behind that. Thank you.

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Maybe you've read more into my quote than I meant. At the end of the day, Arista is viewed as a data center company. But if you look at the diversified portfolio where we're trying to say we're entering many more new markets like routing, like campus and even subsets of the market like securing our solutions better with encryption, with better visibility and observability and indeed, we'll talk more about new market expansion in a couple of days. So not -- undoubtedly, we're moving from becoming a pure data center company to many more markets that center the data in different locations.

Q - Samik Chatterjee{BIO 15496543 <GO>}
Yeah. Thank you. Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess it's a similar question to the last one, but Jayshree, I just wanted to understand as we look at your growth with cloud customers, how should we think about sort of that growth rate of -- sort of how much of that growth is coming from the additional use cases you're addressing beyond traditional switching? So for example, like DCI or routing, how much of that is probably contributing to the strong growth you're seeing with cloud customers? As we think about sort of the next couple of years, how should we think about the -- given the visibility you have in terms of designs, how is that sort of momentum progressing from here on?

And just a quick follow-up there, so outside of Facebook and Meta as we think about the engagement with other cloud companies, is that on some of the new used cases or is that traditional switching in leaf and spine?

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
First, I think you, it's super important to understand that even though it's leaf and spines, Samik, these data centers, when we were building them at a regional level or a mega scale level, the leaf and spine is really going to expand and explode as the cloud titans expand their presence. So that growth -- that organic growth that we began our journey with them will continue and we will depend on that growth.

In addition to that, as Anshul said, we will have new use cases on the WAN, the regional, the DCI and especially the AI Spine, particularly with the cloud titans. It may expand to -- those new use cases may also expand to other specialty cloud providers. But I would say we would be looking for sources of growth in both areas, expansion of the existing data centers into new locations, and more scale, as well as new use cases.

Q - George Notter{BIO 1556662 <GO>}
Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to go back to the question of the cloud titan customers potentially building inventory. And I guess on an earlier question Anshul, you were pretty dismissive of that idea. I guess I'm just wondering what additional detail you might kind of have that supports that idea? And if I look at your business, you've been growing product sales 55%, 67% year-on-year last couple of quarters, it's pretty outstanding growth and given the mix shift in the company, I would guess that the cloud titan customers have been growing 70% or 80 % year-on-year, right? So, you guys are building your own inventories, many companies are building their own inventory in the supply chain environment, so I do think it is important question. I guess I'm wondering exactly how you know customers aren't building inventories of your stuff? Thanks.

A - Anshul Sadana{BIO 16683800 <GO>}
George, that is a good question. I get asked that internally daily, because we have to worry about what's going on the other side, our customers buffering. I would say the best sign is the number of phone calls I get or Jayshree gets or others from the company get on when the hell are you shipping? So, these customers are still roughly hand-to-mouth. There are few places where they can -- still can wait for computer to come up and so on. But in most cases, customers are desperate, the deployment teams are waiting for the gear to show up and they light it up as quickly as possible.

You have to realize where we came from, but since the start of COVID, the world has been constrained and that constrain over such a long period generally means people can't execute the project timelines and they're still short. At some point, this will recover. We're nowhere close to that at this -- in today's times. So I think it'll take a long time, maybe I'll (inaudible) if supply recovers the end of '23, I think that's when customers will feel comfortable and they will eventually have an opportunity to buffer up, but not here -- not there today.

Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.

Q - Sami Badri{BIO 20178177 <GO>}
Hi, thank you. I wanted to go to gross margins. I think Ita you've made two references on this call regarding just the trajectory of margins. I think you said that we're probably not going to see an improvement in gross margins for at least a year from now. And then the other comment you made regarding the 200 basis points to 300 basis points, I think you said it's going to be there for a while. So does that imply that we should be modeling gross margins at least through maybe the first half of 2023, a little bit more in line to last couple of quarters? That's the first question.

Second question is, if you were to give us an idea on how many ports or how many switches of 400-gig ports shipped in 2022, could you give us kind of like a percentage of total shipments and maybe what that would look like in 2023?

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
Yes, this is on the gross margin. I think -- given where we are today, I think it's not a bad idea to model that gross margin as being kind of constrained until we get out from under the constraints honestly. I think that's a very real kind of cost that we're carrying, and it's not clear yet exactly when that starts to improve. So yeah, I think it's not a bad idea to hold it there until we're able to kind of show real demonstrable improvement and more predictability, I guess on these decommitted parts.

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
Yeah. And to answer your question, I don't have exact numbers on 400-gig, but if I had to guess, even though we're gaining customers, most of them are as uplinks, so the number of ports is still small. I would say our penetration is well under 10%, maybe even 5%. That's just a good guess.

Q - Sami Badri{BIO 20178177 <GO>}
And then -- thank you for answering gross margin and that piece. But when we go into 2023, are you seeing almost like a sharp increase in that from sub-10 to obviously much higher than that or not quite yet?

A - Jayshree V. Ullal{BIO 1737637 <GO>}
No. If we go into '23, the way to think of this is people are still migrating from 10 gig and 10 gig and 40 gig to 100 gig will still be the largest migration. As a result of that migration, you will see more deployment of 400 gig. So, 400 gig will still be small. Maybe it will go from 5 to 10.

Q - Sami Badri{BIO 20178177 <GO>}

Hey, ladies, nice quarter, and Anshul as well. Well, it's a metric, Ita, I know you don't really want to emphasize as much as others do in your space. You still have no visibility here and confidence in that visibility. Maybe asking in a different way than others, as supply chain here starts to normalize, how are you guys thinking about how long that backlog actually takes to turn back to a more normal level? Is at four, six kind of eight quarters that's currently in your thought process for next year? Are you seeing any change in cancelation rates? And then just lastly, what's going on with that services deferred revenue as, in aggregate, we were down about $92 million and product was only with down $63 million. So, trying to understand why services is being impacted here?

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
Yes. Maybe to start with the services piece of it. It's just all about the timing of the service agreements, right? If you think about what deferred revenue is -- if I sign a contract on day one and if the two-year, three-year contract are going to have the maximum amount of deferred revenue you can have. And then when you comes towards the renewal of that contract, you're going to have the least amount of deferred revenue that you could have from a services perspective, right? So, it's purely on timing on the services side, right. The lumpier, I think is obviously on the product, but the services is to read just the mechanics of how the services contracts flow, right?

And then I guess on the cancelations, et cetera, I mean we have not seen any change in the business. I think we're -- to Anshul's point, I mean we're still seeing customers very intently focused on getting products at this point. I'm not going to try to age out the backlog that's kind of a -- we're not quite there or ready to do that, just given some of the uncertainties on supply and so on.

And I think as lead times improve, we expect customer visibility to shrink. But, right now, we are working hard on that lead time improvement. So, we're a year away from that.

Q - Tom Blakey{BIO 4441654 <GO>}
Looking at your -- what am - I am curious about the cadence of the cloud titan revenue. It seems like a big uptick here in the second half if I'm characterizing correctly from kind of the mid-to-high 30s to get to that 45% for the year, you need to imply kind of over half. And if I do that simple arithmetic, it implies that may be the cumulative revenue of service provider -- specialty service providers financial enterprises would be kind of flattening out in the second half. Could you just maybe comment on is my characterization correct? And therein as a follow-up, we're relying a little bit more on one of those particular cloud titans more than the other and about a correlation to actual CapEx spend comment would be helpful too. Thank you.

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
Yes. I mean I think as you look at the year, I mean obviously, we've been ramping revenues and ramping shipments. So, we have been ramping kind of with cloud as well, right? And cloud has grown faster. It started off from a lower base, obviously. So, it did need to recover, if you like, it was at 30%, which was pretty much the lowest we have seen it last year, and we - so it's definitely recovered from there. I think on the rest of the business, the demand is there. The demand has certainly exceeded our expectations when we came into the year. But given the shipment constraints, etcetera, it's kind of a bit of -- we have been trying to stick to the FIFO first in, first out as much as we can. And so that has been more constrained. I think we will expect to see that kind of start to improve, hopefully, here as we head into next year.

Q - Tom Blakey{BIO 4441654 <GO>}
Thank you. And Meta versus Microsoft, maybe into the second-half --

A - Ita Brennan{BIO 16651666 <GO>}
Yeah, that's -- we'll have to wait for the year-end for that I think.

Q - Tom Blakey{BIO 4441654 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks everybody.
