Cristiano R. Amon{BIO 3259554 <GO>}
Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Based on our performance over the past several quarters and the strong fiscal second quarter guidance, it is clear that our strategy is working. Demand for our products and solutions continues to accelerate as our one technology roadmap is driving the growth of premium Android smartphones, as well as enabling the connected intelligent edge, which is driving digital transformation for the cloud-connected economy.

As you can see from our results today, strong performance in our chipset in licensing business led to record fiscal first quarter revenues of $10.7 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.23. Our chipset business had its second consecutive quarter of record performance with revenues of $8.8 billion, EBT of $3.1 billion, and an EBT margin of 35%. Notably, QCT revenues exceeded those of any fabless semiconductor company. These results demonstrate the continued success of our diversification strategy.

In IoT, we continue to see strong momentum. With revenue growth of 41% year-over-year in the first quarter across consumer, edge networking, and industrial. In consumer IoT, our early investments collaboration with Microsoft in the recent acquisition of NUVIA uniquely positions us to drive the PC industry transition to ARM-based computing for next-generation connected laptops.

We've recently introduced two new platforms. The 8cx Gen 3 and 7c+- Gen 3. In [ph]ex CES, we highlighted broad support from ecosystem partners, including Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, and Microsoft. As well as 200 enterprise customers currently testing or deploying Windows on Snapdragon laptops in two-in-one devices.

We are also seeing strong growth in premium in high-tier Android tablets. Further highlighting the convergence of mobile and PC. Notably, we have already doubled the total number of premium tier Android tablet design wins launch or in the pipeline versus all of fiscal '21. Additionally, as the Metaverse opportunity materializes, we continue to build on our industry leadership position in VR and AR devices with key ecosystem players including Meta and Microsoft.

At CES, we announced a collaboration with Microsoft to expand and accelerate the adoption of augmented reality in both the consumer and enterprise sectors. This partnership includes custom AR chips to enable a new wave of power-efficient, lightweight AR glasses to deliver rich and immersive experiences as well as plans to integrate our Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform into Microsoft Mesh.

We're also very pleased that Time Magazine named our Snapdragon XR2 platform as one of the best inventions of 2021. And we're seeing strong support for our VR and AR platforms from virtually all ecosystem providers, OEMs, and content creators.

In edge networking, we continue to lead in current and next-generation high-performance Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E solutions, which now make up more than 80% of our Wi-Fi access point revenues. Recently, we launched the world's first quad-band Wi-Fi 6E Mesh system with NETGEAR which was rated the best-in-class Mesh platform by PC Magazine.

Additionally, our Wi-Fi 6 immersive home platforms continue to gain momentum across regions with significant growth now expanding into China. One of the fastest-growing markets for Wi-Fi 6, for both retail and carrier deployments. 5G as wireless fiber, continues to gain scale and expand globally. In addition to our extended range millimeter-wave platforms, we recently expanded our portfolio to include the 5G fixed wireless access solutions with extended range sub-6 and we're seeing strong traction.

In industrial, we're still in the early phases of digital transformation across many industries in demand for our solutions continues to accelerate. As an example, combined smart utility meter, tracking robotics in retail revenues more than double over the last year. In Robotics specifically, we expect total fiscal '22 product launches using our platforms to increase by over 50% year-over-year spanning applications from warehouse automation to public safety delivery services and in-home assistance.

The diversity of vertical segments and applications reflects our ability to provide a common platform that integrates advanced computer vision on-device AI, high performance in low power computing, and industry-leading connectivity technologies. In RF front-end, we successfully launch our latest 5G modules which now include our ultraBAW technology. Our modem to antenna strategy is working, enhancing power and performance with every generation of Snapdragon.

Notably, virtually all our Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 design wins now include Qualcomm ultraBAW filter technology. Building on our success in handsets, we're seeing traction with our modem to antenna solution across automotive and IoT. As examples, we're well-positioned to address up to $30 of 5G RF content per vehicle, and we're also intersecting our RF front-end roadmap with Wi-Fi 7.

In automotive, Qualcomm is becoming the technology partner of choice for the industry and we are enabling the transition of the automobile to an additional cloud-connected platform. Our innovative Snapdragon digital chassis is an open and scalable cloud-enabled platform for telematics, connectivity, digital cockpit, and ADAS and uniquely position us as the leading system solution provider for silicon, software, systems, and services across multiple domains.

As a reminder, General Motors, BMW, and now Renault Group, are cornerstone customers for our platform including ADAS. At CES, we announced an addition to our ADAS and autonomy platform. The Snapdragon Ride Vision System, a new modular computer vision solution that combines our Snapdragon Ride associates with the next generation visual perception software from a driver.

It supports the various compute functions needed for enhanced perception around the vehicle and it scales across applications from entry-tier incap front camera to comprehensive front is round view camera for enhanced autonomy. We expect this Snapdragon Ride Vision System to be available in production in 2024. In handsets, we've recently announced our most advanced 5G mobile platform for flagship smartphones, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 at our annual Snapdragon Tech Summit. The announcement was viewed by more than 50 million people worldwide.

The new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 leads the way to a new era of premium mobile technology with category-defining enhancements across more than RF, camera, AI, gaming, security and more. Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is the world's first 5G modem RF solution to reach 10-gigabit download speed, is the first to include a commercial 18-bit mobile image sensor, and world's first platform compliant with the Android ready secure element alliance.

We also announced new mobile platforms in every Snapdragon series to address global customer demand across every smartphone tier. In our licensing business, first quarter results reflect a favorable mix in the strength of smartphone shipments. With over 150 5G license agreements, QTL as well-positioned for the future and we continue to expect 5G to have a longer life cycle than prior generations due to its broad application across multiple industries.

Lastly, demand remained strong across all of our technologies and continues to exceed supply. Despite ongoing challenges across the global supply chain, our multi-sourcing and capacity expansion initiatives will provide incremental improvements to our supply throughout the year.

I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.

Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon everyone. We are extremely pleased to report strong results to start our fiscal year. We delivered our second consecutive quarter of record non-GAAP earnings with revenues of $10.7 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.23. These results reflect year-over-year increases of 30% and 49% respectively, driven by strength across both QCT and QTL.

For QCT, this was another record quarter with revenues of $8.8 billion and EBT of $3.1 billion, up 35% and 62% respectively versus the year-ago quarter. QCT EBT margins of 35% surpass the high-end of our guidance range and increased 6 points versus the year-ago quarter driven by revenue scale and operating leverage.

Handset revenues of $6 billion increased 42% year-over-year due to greater than 60% growth in revenues from Snapdragon chipsets for Android devices. RF front-end revenues of $1.1 billion grew 7% versus the year-ago quarter reflecting the previously mentioned pull-in of demand into the fourth fiscal quarter. Our RF front-end revenues for Android devices grew by greater than 25% versus the year-ago quarter as we continue to see strong traction across all major OEMs.

IoT revenues were up 41% year-over-year to $1.5 billion on continued demand for our cloud-connected intelligent edge devices. Each of the consumer edge networking and industrial categories grew by at least 30% compared to the year-ago quarter. Automotive revenues of $256 million grew 21% year-over-year on the strength of our design wins across our Snapdragon digital Chassis. Prerecorded QTL revenues of $1.8 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, and EBT margins of 77% which was above the midpoint of the guidance. These results reflect a favorable mix and slightly higher handset shipments.

Turning to Global handsets and our guidance for the second fiscal quarter. For calendar 2021, consistent with the previous guidance, we estimate global 3G, 4G, 5G handsets grew 7% year-over-year, including approximately 535 million 5G handsets. For calendar 2022, there is no change to the forecast provided at our Investor Day, with greater than 750 million 5G handsets. For the second fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $10.2 billion to $11 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.80 to $3.

In QCT, we expect revenues of $8.7 billion to $9.3 billion and EBT margins of 32% to 34%. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of 43% and EBT dollar growth of $1.4 billion. For handsets and RF front-end, we expect revenues to be in line sequentially as the seasonal decline in Apple revenues is offset by continued growth in revenues from Android devices. Within handsets, the increase in Android revenue is driven by the launch of our new Snapdragon premium chipset and additional shipments across high and mid-tiers due to our second sourcing efforts.

Additionally, we expect strong year-over-year and sequential growth in our IoT and Automotive revenue streams. We estimate QTL revenues of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion and EBT margins of 70% to 74%. This reflects the normal pre-COVID trends following the strong holiday quarter. We anticipate non-GAAP operating expenses to be up 7% to 9% sequentially, on normal seasonality including calendar year resets for certain employee-related costs. The remaining increase reflects select investments in long-term growth initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day.

Looking forward to the third fiscal quarter, we are forecasting year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth of greater than 30%. For QCT, this reflects the seasonality following Chinese New Year purchases and the launch of our new Snapdragon premium chipset in the second quarter. We expect the next inflection point in QCT to be in the second half of the calendar year with the launch of new 5G handsets across several major OEMs.

Lastly, we published our Annual Corporate Responsibility and ESG report yesterday, which outlines progress against our companywide targets, including environmental sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and power efficiency of our Snapdragon products. We are pleased to have been recognized by several organizations including making the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and news week's most responsible company list for the third consecutive year.

Thank you. Back to you, Mauricio.

Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan{BIO 20932685 <GO>}
Thank you, Akash. Operator, we're now ready for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.

Q - Samik Chatterjee{BIO 15496543 <GO>}
Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the results. I guess if I can start with, you talked about the strong launch with Android customers that you've had in both phones and tablets. And I think you mentioned doubling the pace of launches with Android. As we look to the -- beyond the first half, that is your fiscal first-half, December and March, how should we think about how much of the Android share gains for you or launches for you is already in the run rate? And how much of that is like weighted for the remainder of the year or beyond sort of this first half of the year? If you can share some color on how to think about share gains continuing for the remainder of the year with Android? And then I've a follow-up, please.

A - Cristiano R. Amon{BIO 3259554 <GO>}
Hi, Samik. This is Cristiano. Look, Android is a success story for us. This quarter continues to validate what we said before. OEM, share -- in shifts in China is benefiting Qualcomm. And we saw significant growth of Qualcomm share within the market as we have this up -- this new 10 opportunity. And we've seen that reflected in the growth we've seen in premium and high tiers.

So it continues to be a story; A, was the highlight of what happened in the handset within the quarter? What Akash outlined is 60% year-over-year growth on Android. And I'll shift over to Akash to talk about the seasonality.

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Yeah, Samik, I think this is something that will sustain for us going forward. We are in a very strong position, as you see in the numbers. Our product portfolio is very strong as well. So as we keep go forward, we continue to expect to see this benefit in our financials.

Q - Samik Chatterjee{BIO 15496543 <GO>}
Yeah. Got it. And just for my follow-up. I know you talked about the second source helping in terms of -- obviously, in terms of realizing better revenues. But if you can talk about what are you seeing in terms of the cadence of the improvement there? Do you get to where you want to be with supply during the year? Or does it take longer? If you can just give us an update on how you think about supply here?

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Sure. So overall, the demand as Cristiano mentioned in his prepared remarks is extremely strong across the board. And so we are continuing to see demand outpacing supply. As you rightly mentioned, we had put plans in place very early in the process anticipating some of these challenges and you're seeing the benefit of that, right? We have three second sourcing parts, especially in the mid-high tiers that are shipping at scale now. And that shows up in our financial performance. And we have additional parts coming up as well. So that's definitely something that's helping us.

The second is we're seeing capacity builds from some of our suppliers and that's playing a role as well. As you look forward, we expect supply to continue to improve gradually through the year in addition to where we are at now. And this entire picture obviously as you would expect is factored into our guidance.

A - Cristiano R. Amon{BIO 3259554 <GO>}
Look, this is Cristiano, and I think nothing more to add other than in simple terms, we see supply improvements, our forward guide, it contemplates the visibility we have in supply. And we still have more demand than supply, we'll ship more if we could.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Chris Caso{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Yes, thank you. Good evening. I wanted to ask about the commentary about the June quarter, and the second half of the calendar year, your commentary there. Can you give a little more color on that it's not typical for you to provide color two quarters in advance, so I imagine it's purposeful of why you're doing that? And maybe talk a little bit about the second half of the calendar year. Is that really a function of more supply coming on allowing you to perhaps balance supply and demand as you get to the second half of the calendar year?

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. So overall when you look at our fiscal year, we are tracking well ahead of plan. We're very, very happy with how the year is playing out for us. And that obviously puts us in a very strong position to meet and exceed our long-term Investor Day targets. If you look at the first half outperformance beyond that as we go into the third fiscal quarter, we are projecting EPS growth of at least 30%, an opportunity beyond that. And then as you get into the September quarter, as you know well that's kind of the next inflection point for us with launches, additional phone launches across several major OEMs. So we're going to -- we are expecting very strong year-over-year growth in the September quarter as well.

Also, when you look beyond handsets, and we look at the second half of fiscal '22, RF front-end, IoT, and automotive all are poised to continue to show very strong year-over-year growth as we go through the year. So generally, when you step back, we had a very strong second half of fiscal '21, fiscal '22 is shaping up, just like that, very strong year-over-year growth rates.

Q - Chris Caso{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
It's very helpful. Thanks. In addition to the longer-term goals, you present at the Analyst Day. You also talked about fiscal '22 guidance for at least 20% EPS growth based on what you're saying for June, again, it seems like you're well ahead of that as well. Any commentary update on that fiscal '22 guidance?

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Yeah, Chris. That's the right conclusion. We're tracking well ahead of it. We are not updating that number yet. But I think based on the guidance that you have for the second fiscal quarter, and third fiscal quarter, and the comments I gave on the fourth. What you're -- drawing is a very reasonable conclusion.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Rod Hall{BIO 20453923 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks, guys. Appreciate the question. I was just taking a look, we've been looking at this for a while, the quarter-on-quarter marginal contribution. So the QCT marginal contribution if I look at the change in EBT and the change in revenue, I'm calculating 58% there in this quarter? And I know some of that is scaling, but I'd wonder if there's any way you could maybe at least give us some color on how much of that is the new marginal sales in QCT being higher margin? And how much of it is just scaling effect on the revenue? Thanks. And then I have a follow-up.

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Rod, just to confirm. And this is Akash. Just to confirm, your question was about the actuals for the December quarter?

Q - Rod Hall{BIO 20453923 <GO>}
Yeah. So Akash, what all I've done is taken the EBT of the December quarter, less the EBT of the September quarter, and put it over the revenue difference.

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Correct, correct. Great.

Q - Rod Hall{BIO 20453923 <GO>}
Yeah.

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
So, I think it's a great story. You're seeing a combination of all three drivers, right? You have revenue scale benefiting us, gross margin strength quarter-over-quarter also benefiting us, and then operating leverage of the business. So it's a combination of all three, and we're pretty excited that not just gross margin performance is great. When you look at operating margins as well, 35% is really a great benchmark for us. It's the highest margin in a long time for us. So pretty excited about where we're at and where we're going with it.

Q - Rod Hall{BIO 20453923 <GO>}
Great, thanks. And then on my follow-up. I wanted to ask you, Cristiano. If you could maybe comment on the -- there's been a lot of noise in the high-end Android chip market about the upcoming competition and so on. And I just wonder maybe you could comment on the competitive environment a little bit there, what you're seeing? What do you anticipate seeing in the next six or nine months? Thanks.

A - Cristiano R. Amon{BIO 3259554 <GO>}
Happy to do it. Before I answer the question, I just want to add one thing to the prior question that Akash answered. Look, we've been talking about are one technology roadmap that really scales and this is exactly what you see is our diversification strategy unfolds and more and more of the revenue coming towards QCT, is from the non-handset business. It gives us scale for the business is all accretive to margins, and I think that's reflected in the numbers.

And I think that will continue to be the story as we are able to leverage the roadmap. Now, back to your question on the competition. We're very happy where we are. Look, I provided a metric that we do not usually do that in my prepared remarks. When we launched a new Snapdragon 8 series, we had 50 million views of the launch event. And we have done that simultaneously both in the United States as well in two different locations in China.

Snapdragon is becoming the preferred brand for premium-tier Android, not a single one of our customers' thinkable flagship without thinking Snapdragon 8 series. It's a very strong position to be in. As our customers move to the premium tier, we see that turn into gains of share of the market for Qualcomm that's why Android is the story of our handset business right now. And the reality is, as we look at the OEM share shifts that happen in China, there's plenty of opportunity for us to grow and our competitors to grow. And I expect that we'll continue to have good results in more and more our customers will be betting on every Snapdragon brand.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Mike Walkley{BIO 21508060 <GO>}
Great, thanks. Congratulations on the results. Also, I guess a question for me on the $10 billion SAM opportunity within the Android that you've previously highlighted. How do you think much of that benefit in this first half of the year guidance? And how much further do you think you have to go and penetrating that SAM?

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Yeah. Mike, this is Akash. What's really happening with the $10 billion SAM opportunity is with the OEM mix change in China, all of our customers, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Honor. They're all picking up share. And as they pick up share and also go up-tier going into the high and the premium-tier, as Cristiano just outlined, it gives us a tremendous opportunity to tap into it. So we've done a lot of it through, obviously, our products being great but also working on the second sources that we mentioned in our prepared remarks. We still think that there is an opportunity to continue to expand into that SAM going forward.

Q - Mike Walkley{BIO 21508060 <GO>}
Great. Thanks. And just my follow-up question. I think you previously highlighted, to start the first half of the year, you kind of prioritize the strong android premium-tier handsets. You talked about demand outstripping supply. Is it get to maybe a softer handset quarter in the June quarter, should we see maybe Automotive and IoT start to close that supply-demand balance in those businesses maybe accelerate in terms of a sequential growth trend?

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Yeah, Mike. We are definitely -- that's a decision that we definitely make where if we can bias the supply in certain directions, based on the market demands. We take advantage of that and so it's something that we'll definitely do as we get to the June quarter.

A - Cristiano R. Amon{BIO 3259554 <GO>}
Look, this Cristiano. Let me just add one thing. I want to hopefully this will explain. We're seeing demand for all of our product lines, we are seeing more demand than supply right now. I think demand continues to be up, I think we're very fortunate position to be in. When you think about the handset business and you did see this very high growth rate in Android, 60% growth of Android within the quarter, we prioritized supply as we said in the prior quarters, for the Chinese New Year launches, we will still have more demand in supply and all the growth business.

As we go to the next quarters, you're going to see the growth business and a lot of the non-handset business could growing, and then the next inflection point for handsets is the holiday season which is our September quarter. And as we expect supply improvements throughout the year, I think we'll be able to continue to drive growth in all businesses, we're very happy that how the year is unfolding. And as I said our supply picture is reflected in our forward guide. Having said that, demand continues to go up and it's a good thing.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Stacy Rasgon{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask about the chipset gross margins in the quarter. I know you don't report them, and if I sort of stare at it. I think they probably were up a couple of 100 basis points. And I find that interesting just given the relative strength of handsets versus the adjacencies, which I think do have higher margins. Was that just the Android strength? What you talked about that drove that margin in the quarter and then how should we think about that in March as sort of the mix reverses, but you should have some of the higher margins of the adjacencies is actually growing sequentially in March? I mean is there room for more margin expansion as we go into the next quarter?

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Yes. Stacy, it's Akash. So it's a combination of, obviously the additions outside non-handsets businesses helping the gross margin. Within handsets, you're seeing the benefit come through, especially as premium and high-tier devices, the high end of Android are being consumed, and we're selling into that market. And as you will see in the guidance that we gave, we are still continuing to be optimistic with the gross margin picture.

Q - Stacy Rasgon{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Got it. That's helpful. For my follow-up. I wanted to ask about the buyback, you bought quite a bit of stock, I believe in the quarter. And I think at the Analyst Day, you talked about buybacks, is only really being anti-dilutive. It looks like we are seeing share counts come down. I guess how should we be thinking about the buyback going forward, given the cash generation? And I noticed this quarter you didn't guide the share count on a more structural level. It does look like it's down a little lower. Should be thinking about share count continue to go down through the year, given the capital return that we're seeing?

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Stacy, no change on the framework that we've given on buybacks before. We are continuing to focus on prioritize anti-dilutive buybacks and opportunistically look for -- on top of that if we can do additional buybacks. And so what you're seeing in the quarter is a portion of that showing up. But fundamentally, our framework doesn't change.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Tal Liani{BIO 1643846 <GO>}
Hai. I have two questions. The first one is other suppliers of Apple, noted that orders for March were strong, but then at least one of them said that the guidance for June is very weak because there's going to be a reversion to the mean. And the question I have is, is there any concentration of QCT handsets this with that gives you some concerns over any of the customers that might be reducing orders that there is any abnormal behavior this quarter might be reducing orders later on? That's my first question.

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Sure.

Q - Tal Liani{BIO 1643846 <GO>}
Okay. I'll take it one by one. Sorry.

A - Cristiano R. Amon{BIO 3259554 <GO>}
Sure. Yeah, Tal, nothing to look at there. I mean [ph]that is the end of the story. We are going to -- Apple is going to have their buying pattern across the quarters and so that will flow through. But really our focus is on the Android market. And there, isn't a specific story that we are worried about there. Our position is good and design traction going forward looks great.

Q - Tal Liani{BIO 1643846 <GO>}
Okay. The second question and I don't know how to look at it, but when I look at handset revenues were well above the consensus estimates, but RF, auto, and IoT you reported slightly below consensus estimates for the quarter. And I'm just wondering is there any -- first of all, can you discuss the quarter for these non-handset markets or maybe RF is part of handsets? And then can you discuss seasonality what -- these are new markets, relatively speaking, what should we think about seasonality here?

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Yeah, sure. So, Tal, as we had said at the previous earnings call, December being a strong quarter for the handset business. We definitely prioritize the handset business over some of the other new opportunities. Still great demand in those areas. And as we go forward, you will see that growth rates ramp in each of those businesses. It's reflected in our guidance as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect auto and IoT to see strong sequential growth. In the second quarter, and also a strong year-over-year growth. As you look at the second half of the year, you're going to see the same trend, strong year-over-year growth across the board.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Ross Seymore{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Hi guys, thanks for let me ask a question. Whether it's Cristiano or Akash, I'm not who this is better aligned to, but I wanted to see what your strategy is on the pricing side of the equation, plus or increasing everybody is trying to get more supply. Are you passing along those costs? Is it margin accretive? And how are you using price on the revenue side of things as a tailwind? Should we be assuming that some of the goodness that we're seeing year-over-year is coming from the price side of the equation or not?

A - Cristiano R. Amon{BIO 3259554 <GO>}
Thanks, Ross. This is Christiano. Thanks for the question. Here's how you should think about it. One thing that is probably separate, as we've been very focused in premium, in high-tier devices, high-value devices, a lot of new technology. And therefore it's, we're kind of less impacted by semiconductor cost increase is more about the value of the platform we offer. The second part of the answer is, what we said I think earlier, our one-technology roadmap really scales. And as we use the technology in our R&D to serve more markets, we gain scale with our application processor in premium to Android, and Android becomes the key story of mobile, not the modem is really the application processor in the Snapdragon 800 is the key story. Plus we have the processing in connectivity into automotive and IoT, it is accretive to margins, the business gained scale and those are highly profitable, I think product offerings. So those two things have a factor. And this is reflected in the QCT 35% operating margin.

Q - Ross Seymore{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Thanks for that color. I guess as my follow-up one probably for Akash, on the OpEx side of things. It looks like the March quarter is doing what it typically does in your guidance up seasonally, any sort of puts and takes for the rest of the year, that would be different than your traditional seasonality in that line?

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Not really. It will be consistent with our historical seasonality. The one thing to keep in mind is, as we close the Veoneer transaction, they will become a factor in our OpEx trend going forward, but overall there is -- you should expect that trend to be consistent with historical.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Matt Ramsay{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Thank you very much, and good afternoon everybody. Cristiano, I wanted to a lot of the conversation here has been focused on supply versus demand for your products, and the wafers and et cetera that it takes to make your products, but a lot of the calls we all do in SMEs, we're hearing about [ph]match set issues and kitting issues for your end-customers making devices. And what I've heard more about in the last six months and I expect to going forward is, is maybe a push by Qualcomm to use our scale to help your OEM customers get the remainder of the kit to make phones, pushing people more closely to be strictly aligned around the reference design where you can control more of the components in those reference designs.

I wonder if you're finding your scale to be an advantage? One. And number two, does that have implications on attach rates of RF and other types of components that might generate revenue for Qualcomm in those design? Thanks.

A - Cristiano R. Amon{BIO 3259554 <GO>}
No. Thanks for the question. It's a complicated thing here. I will try to provide a simple answer. Look, when we talk, for example, and I'm just going to pick this product an example, we talk about Snapdragon 8 series Generation 1, and it's a leading node SOC, but it has a lot of attach. Yes, yes. The transceiver has entire front end attach, it has power management actually. And at the end of the day, when we provide a chipset solution to our customers, we need capacity across a number of different notes.

So when we think about multi-sourcing our products and put capacity expansion plans in place, so we have supply to support both our handsets in the growth business. We have been building capacity across all of those different technologies. And as an example, when you think of things like a power management IC or even transceiver, WeWork with four or five foundries. So in the semiconductor supply chain shortage, it is across everything. Now having said that, the second part of the answer is scale has been very helpful. Two things have been very helpful for Qualcomm. One is the high predictability we have on our demand. We can bet on ourselves and therefore we have the ability to make long-term capacity planning and get long-term capacity commitments from our vendors big, and also the scale that we have to be able to utilize multi-sourcing that has put us in a good position to navigate through this.

Now having said that, and so I'll repeat what I said before, we're still, have more demand and supply, even though we're very happy with the growth rates and how good was the quarter, the guide, how we've been managing, I think the seasonality between handsets in the growth business. And as we said, supply is going to get better as we get to the second half of 2022.

Q - Matt Ramsay{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Very helpful, thank you for that. Just as a follow-up on the auto business. You guys presented a very compelling story around data assets at the Investor Day. But I was a bit surprised that the Ultra Cruise announcement so quickly. Congrats on that. Maybe you could give a little bit more details behind that relationship with GM? And if you have other irons in the fire of a similar profile? Thanks.

A - Cristiano R. Amon{BIO 3259554 <GO>}
Thanks for the question. Automotive is really an incredible opportunity for Qualcomm, super excited about everything is happening Automotive has happened a very short period of time. And I think we have something that is very unique, it separate us from everybody else. So it's not about having a component, it's about creating a digital chassis with capabilities in all domains from connecting the part of the cloud telematics, the entire immersive digital cockpit experience, and of course ADAS and autonomy plus a service platform.

GM is, as we said a cornerstone customer that is not only looking into the capability of ADAS, and we're super proud of the work will them above of Super Cruise and Ultra Cruise. But also the ability to look of the entire chassis. BMW was another one, which we announced towards our Analyst Day, at CES we announced Renault as an addition to the digital chassis. We, you should expect that we have a lot of other irons in the fire. And overall automotive is a good story for Qualcomm, it's something that we can actually take a platform approach and take some of the things we have done in mobile it takes the technology to scale up and down to every tier of automobile. And you -- I think we're just in the beginning of having more ADAS design wins and having the chassis be recognized as a key platform going forward.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Joe Moore{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about RF for the year. The RF businesses' ability to keep pace with handsets overall. And kind of what are the metrics we should look at it is, is millimeter-wave rollout kind of more broadly, an important factor? Or is it content growth in the sort of next, 200 million 5G handsets. So how are you thinking about overall RF for the year?

A - Akash Palkhiwala{BIO 19085180 <GO>}
Sure. Joe, it's Akash. If you go back to what we said at Analyst Day and the target that we set for the RF business, really no change there. We '22 is playing out as we expected it's on track to position us to achieve the target that we laid out. You should also think of RF as not just handsets. And today most of the businesses and sets but we're going to have RF opportunities with 5G and automotive, with 5G and IoT, and then Wi-Fi RF as well. So tremendous growth opportunities outside of handsets that's in front of us.

On millimeter-wave, the guidance that we gave at Analyst Day, did not have any heroic assumptions off growth of millimeter-wave globally. We think of that as an upside opportunity.

Q - Joe Moore{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Great, thank you.

Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Brett Simpson with Arete Research. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Brett Simpson{BIO 3279126 <GO>}
Yeah. thanks very much. A question for Cristiano. You talked a lot about Android strength this year, but I guess on China smartphones, we've seen some volatility in the sort of, sell-in versus sell-through last quarter. Is this sort of typical kind of build-up ahead of Chinese New Year, that we should expect? And I guess when you look at new product launches in China, last year, we didn't get any new premium Android launches in the June quarter. Nothing meaningful from Chinese customers. So I'm just keen to get your perspective on demand from Chinese customers in the March and June quarters as things look a little bit more volatile than we'd expect.

A - Cristiano R. Amon{BIO 3259554 <GO>}
No, it's a great question. And I think as we've been trying to talk about on this call, when you think about the handset Android revenue for us, in the growth we're having an Android, do you see a lot of growth right now, you saw that 60% year-over-year growth of Android and we also have sequential growth. That's because of the Chinese New Year, and we are more skewed towards premium and high-tier. And then we have the next inflection point will be the holiday season.

And I think this is all contemplated in our guide. And the market, we continue to see demand high, and because I think we're more concentrated in the premium and high tiers years we have been a little bit less impacted by some of the puts and takes that you see towards in the mid, in the low-tier of handsets.

Q - Brett Simpson{BIO 3279126 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Cristiano. And maybe just a follow-up on Windows on ARM. I mean this is something you guys have led over the last, I don't know, three or four years. But can you talk a bit about your share ambitions? I mean, what do you think that an ARM platform and Windows ecosystem can command on a sort of two or three-year view with, especially with the new via asset you've got now, and the Meccano project. And any sort of market share ambitions you can share with us, just to give us put some perspective on how you see this opportunity playing out? Thanks.

A - Cristiano R. Amon{BIO 3259554 <GO>}
Great question. Look, let's talk about the short-term, and then let's talk about the mid-term. The way we look at this, and we have been very clear and very consistent with our vision. At the end of the day, for Qualcomm, it's inevitable that you're going to have a big portion of the PC market moving towards a connected on platform. I think you saw that happening already with Apple.

When you think about the Apple devices, and then we think about the use cases of PCs, PCs are changing, at least for the workhorse for in a laptop, it's about the camera, it's about connectivity, it's about multimedia, it's about streaming with 5G including streaming of gaming, et cetera. So our view is very clear. There is going to be a big portion of the market is going to transition to in our architecture, and when you think of everybody else in the industry, we are the best-positioned company to do that for the Windows ecosystem. And I think that's reflected not only the developments in the partnership we have with Microsoft for the years but also the acquisition of NUVIA.

Short term, as we prepare for a Windows 11. Windows 11 is really the time that you have the ARM ecosystem able to support 32-bit, 64-bit, you have things like the Android apps come into Windows, our new part that we just announced 8cx Gen 3. We talk about a [ph]CES having now the device being tested in 200 large enterprises. And it's a step function will continue to work with our partners on that transition. But I think every OEM that you're going to talk to, especially on the PC Windows side they believe there is going to be a room for ARM-based laptop and that's what Qualcomm is doing.

Operator
Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Amon, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?

A - Cristiano R. Amon{BIO 3259554 <GO>}
Yes. First of all, I would like to thank everyone for joining in the call today. I'm really excited for what 2022 will bring. Demand for our technology is accelerating across virtually every sector and we've remained at the beginning of one of the largest opportunities in our history. Our one technology roadmap with incomparable capabilities in wireless communications, low-power, advanced computing, and on-device AI extends from mobile to automotive and IoT, expanding our addressable market by more than seven times to approximately $700 billion in the next decade.
