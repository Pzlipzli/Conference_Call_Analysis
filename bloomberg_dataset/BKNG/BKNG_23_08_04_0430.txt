Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report that in the second quarter, we continue to see robust leisure travel demand, which helped drive the strong results we are announcing today. The $268 million room nights booked in the second quarter increased by 9% year-over-year, and gross bookings of $39.7 billion, grew 15% year-over-year and was the highest quarterly gross bookings ever. Both room nights and gross bookings came in ahead of our previous expectations, as a result of the favorable demand environment. Revenue growth of 27% in Q2 also nicely outperformed our expectations. The strong top-line results in the quarter combined with better than expected marketing efficiency help drive our Q2 adjusted EBITDA to about $1.8 billion, which is an increase of 64% versus Q2 last year, and meaningfully exceeded our prior growth expectations of about 35%.

Looking at the month of July, we have seen some acceleration in year-over-year room night growth relative to the 9% growth we reported for Q2. We estimate July room nights increased by about 20% year-over-year, benefiting from the easier comparison to July 2022. Overall, we have been very pleased to see our strong performance in the first half of the year, which is benefitted from the continued strength and resiliency of overall travel demand. Our solid start to the year combined with what we currently believe will be a new all-time high for Q3 summer travel period results and an improved outlook for the full year, which David will discuss in detail in his comments. While the near-term results and outlook are encouraging, we remain focused on what is important for the business for the long-term, which means making the necessary investments to strengthen and grow our enterprise, while simultaneously remaining cost conscious. We are seeing progress and momentum across several important initiatives, which will help strengthen our business over the long-term. These initiatives include advancing our Connected Trip vision, further integrating AI technology into our offerings, continue to grow alternative accommodations, and building more direct relationships with our Travel bookers.

Starting with the Connected Trip. This is our long-term vision to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal, more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners. To be clear, this is not a discrete product we'll introduce at some point in the future. Instead, this is a meaningfully enhanced way for a booker to experience and utilize Booking.com. Overtime, you'll see incremental improvements and enhancements to our platform that move us another step closer to this long-term vision and importantly, this approach allows us to realize the benefits, while we are building towards that future state. We believe that the current travel experience is much more complicated, fragmented and frustrating travelers than it should be, and eventually our Connected Trip vision will greatly improve it via technology.

Looking at the other side of the travel marketplace, we believe that our supplier partners will also benefit greatly from the Connected Trip as it will provide more opportunities to personalize and merchandise their offerings. We continue to build out our Connected Trip vision and a much more work to do. So we're pleased with the progress we have made so far and expect to ultimately result in increased customer and supplier engagement with our platform. We've always envisioned the Connected Trip is having AI technology at its center. Across our company, we have a long history with investing in AI technology and incorporating it into our platforms in order to optimize interactions with both our travelers and partners. This is an area where we believe we are well-positioned, given we have built strong teams of AI experts and gained valuable experience from using AI extensively for years.

In addition to the many current application for AI on our platforms, we believe that we can build an even more compelling and differentiated offering for our bookers, we leverage AI technology to deliver a more personalized booking experience. A Connected Trip that would be more responsive to our bookers needs and help manage different aspects of their trips. Generative AI may play an important role in delivering the Connected Trip experience to our bookers and our teams have been hard at work to integrate this exciting technology into our offerings in innovative ways. For example, in early July, Priceline unveiled its 2023 Summer release, which delivered over 40 new booking tools and upgrades, including Penny. Penny is Priceline's generative AI travel assistant. Priceline has currently positioned Penny at the end of the final on the checkout page, where Penny can answer travel-related questions that a customer may have when they reach the checkout page.

Penny is built on Priceline's own proprietary technology and data, and also leverages large language model technology to power its conversational capabilities. The combination of these technologies allows for innovations like the ability to make a booking directly in the chat interface. The Priceline team is rapidly gaining insight on booker questions, concerns, and behavior as Penny continues to interact with customers. The plan is to further enhance Penny overtime, but leveraging these valuable learnings. Around the same time as Priceline Summer release Booking.com launched its own AI Trip Planner, which began rolling out on the mobile app in the US to Genius customers. In contrast to Penny, the AI Trip Planner sits towards the top of the funnel, where travelers are in the discovery and planning processes for their trips. Built upon the foundation of Booking.com's existing machine-learning models that recommend accommodation options to millions of travelers on the platform every day. The AI Trip Planner is also partially powered by large language model technology to create a conversational experience for people to start their trip planning processes.

The AI Trip Planner advances trip planning by providing travelers with a rich visual list of destinations and properties including Booking.com's live pricing information with deep links to view more details on the options. From a chat interface the AI Trip Planner, bookers can tap on any recommended accommodation they are interested in and then complete the reservation. Critical to our approach here is to marry our own proprietary data and machine-learning models with the generative AI technology. This allows us to provide a conversational interface with the traveler, while leveraging our own recommendation engine to provide accurate detailed and real-time information on the property recommendations. Like Priceline, the Booking.com team is already gaining valuable insights from the interactions with bookers, even though the Trip Planner is in beta and is still currently in a relatively limited rollout. While we are excited by these new advancements in Booking.com and Priceline, it is of course, still very early days and we have much more to learn about how customers will ultimately want to interact with this new technology.

In addition, we mentioned last quarter that OpenTable and KAYAK were experimenting AI plugins and we will continue to examine all areas of our company to ensure we are taking advantage of AI-created efficiencies. We are confident in our company's ability to benefit from AI developments and improve our products for our customers given our many years experience in AI, our travel-related data and connections to our supply partners, and our human and financial capital. Across our businesses, we have two equally important customers, our travelers and our supply partners with each representing one-side of our marketplace. For our supply partners, we strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform and we look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses.

One area of focus for us on the supply side continues to be our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com. Alternative accommodation room nights grew faster than our traditional hotel category at about 11% year-over-year for the second quarter and representated about 34% of bookings.com's total room nights, which is 2 percentage points higher than in Q2, 2022. This is a new all-time high mix of our total room nights. We are pleased to see continued momentum in terms of alternative accommodations supply growth, both globally and in the US with global listings reaching about 7 million by the end of the second quarter, which is about 8% higher than Q2 last year. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the US. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increased loyalty, frequency, spend, and direct relationships over time.

In the second quarter, our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continue to increase year-over-year. We see a very -high level of direct bookings in the mobile app, which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and we believe will result in increased traveler loyalty. About 48% of our room nights were booked through our apps in second quarter, which is about 6 percentage points higher than in Q2 2022, an acceleration in the mix-shift compared to Q1 and an all-time high in terms of mix of bookings coming from our mobile apps. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here.

In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strength of travel demand so far this year in and (inaudible) we expect it to be a record summer travel season. Our teams continue to innovate and execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps us position our business well for the long-term. We remain focused on delivering a better offering and experience for our customers, both our supply partners and our travelers alike. We are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel opportunities ahead for our company.

I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.

David Goulden{BIO 1477167 <GO>}
Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the second quarter as well as our thoughts for Q3 and for the full year. All growth rates for 2023 are on year-on-year basis unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019, where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call.

Now on to our second quarter results. Against the tough year-over-year comparison in the second quarter due to strong rebound in travel after Omicron in Q2 last year, we were pleased to have delivered 9% room night growth in Q2, which was a few percentage points better than our expectations. Looking at our year-over-year room night growth by region second quarter, Asia was up over 40%, Rest of World was up low-double-digits, Europe was a couple of points, and the US was down slightly. It's helpful to remember that the US was very strong last Q2 and stronger than Q1 and Q3 versus 2019 due to the rebound from Omicron. Compared to 2019, our Q2 global room night growth was 26%, which was in line with Q1. For the second quarter, all our major regions grew at a similar rate versus 2019. In Q2, the booking window Booking.com expanded further versus 2019, than it did in Q1. The Q2 booking window of Booking.com also expanded versus 2022.

As Glenn mentioned, our mobile apps represented about 48% of our total room nights in the quarter, which is about 6 percentage points higher than the second quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increased mix of our room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel as a percentage of our room nights in the second quarter relative to second quarter of 2022. For the first time since the onset of the pandemic, in Q2, we saw that international mix of our room nights fully recovered to 2019 levels. Our cancellation rates in the second quarter were higher than Q2 2022, as the second quarter of 2022 benefited from the strong recovery in new bookings, following the relaxation of travel restrictions in many parts of the world post-Omicorn. Our cancellation rates in the second quarter continued to be below 2019 levels.

For alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q2 room night growth was about 11% year over year and the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was about 34%, which was higher than about 32% in Q2 2022. Versus 2019, alternative accommodation room night growth was about 38%. Q2 gross bookings increased 15% year-over-year or 16% on a constant currency basis. The 15% increase in gross bookings was 6 points higher than the 9% room night increase due to 5% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a couple of points from flight bookings, partially offset by the 1 percentage points or negative impact from FX movements. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs were negatively impacted by regional mix due to higher mix of room nights in Asia and lower mix of room nights from the US. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 9 percentage points year-over-year.

Despite the higher ADRs in the second quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star rating being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the second quarter were up about 58% year-over-year, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the second quarter came in nicely ahead of our expectations, increasing 27% year-over-year or about 28% on a constant currency basis. Q2 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 130 basis points above last year, which was in line with our expectations. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line increased 4% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 50 basis points lower than Q2 2022, due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business.

Performance marketing ROIs increased year-over-year, due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. Marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q2 was about 60 basis points lower than last year, which is better than our expectation. Relative to expectation, this was primarily due to better ROI in our paid channels as well as lower than expected merchandising spend, which was impacted by the booking window being more expanded than we expect in the quarter, which will push merchandising expense into future periods at the time, revenue is recognized. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 30 basis points compared to last year, a bit better than our expectation. About 48% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform In Q2, up from about 38% in Q2 2022.

Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 20% year-over-year, which was below our expectations due to lower IT expenses in the quarter, including some impact from phasing of IT spend into late in the year. We continue to manage our more fixed expenses very carefully. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.8 billion in the second quarter, which was up 64% year-over-year and would have been up 70% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was well-above our expectations due to stronger top-line, the efficiencies in marketing merchandising and lower than expected IT expenses. Our adjusted EBITDA margins increased by about 7 percentage points versus Q2 2022. Non-GAAP net income of $1.4 billion in the second quarter resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $37.62 per share, which was up 97% year-over-year. Our average share count in the second quarter was 9% below Q2 2022 and 15% below Q2 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $1.3 billion in the quarter.

Now on our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash and investment balance of $15.7 billion was up versus our Q1 ending balance of $15.3 billion due to the $1.9 billion debt issuances in May 2023, and the $1.6 billion of free cash flow generated in the second quarter, offset by $3.1 billion in share repurchases, we completed in the quarter. In the first half of the year, we repurchased $5.1 billion worth shares, which represented 5% of our year-end 2022 share counts. The repurchases so far this year, take our combined authorization down to $19 billion from the $24 billion we discussed earlier in the year. We remain comfortable with our ability to complete the full $24 billion of share repurchases within four years when we started the program at the beginning of this year, assuming no major downturn in the travel environment.

Now onto (inaudible) for the third quarter of 2023. In July, we saw a year-over-year room night growth of about 20%, up from 9% in Q2. Looking across our major regions in July, we saw Asia up about 45%, rest of world up over 20%, Europe up mid-teens and the US up mid-single digits. When comparing versus 2019, July room night growth was in a similar range -- the 26% growth in Q2. The US was our most recovered region with growth at over 30% versus 2019. Our comments for the third quarter and maybe assumption that room night growth will be up low double digits year-on-year, assuming some moderation in growth from July, due in part the harder prior year comparables in August and September. You'll recall from our commentary on the third quarter of 2022, that room night growth versus 2019 was 4% in July 2022 and 10% in August and September 2022. In addition, we expect that due to the expanded booking window, in the first half of the year to stay in Q3, but there'll be fewer last-minute bookings or stays in the rest of Q3. We expect Q3 gross bookings to grow about 7 points faster the room night on a year-on-year basis due to a few points from continued flight bookings growth and a few points of positive impact from FX movements.

We expect accommodation constant currency ADRs to be about in line with Q3 2022, including a couple of points of pressure from the changes in regional mix. We expect Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be around 19% slightly above last year due to a more positive impact from timing in part due to the expanded booking window in the first half of this year and from increased revenue from payments. We expect these will be -- we expect these will be partially offset by a higher mix of flights and increased merchandising spend, some of which is related to bookings we've seen earlier in the year. We expect Q3 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be lower than last year. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q3 to be slightly lower than last year. We expect Q3 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 20 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to higher gross bookings mix. We expect a more fixed expenses in Q3 to grow year-over-year about 30% due to higher personnel-related expenses, higher IT expenses, including the impacts operating from Q2 and higher indirect taxes in G&A.

The year-over-year growth in our more fixed expenses includes about 7 percentage points from changes in FX. The difference between the 20% growth in our more fixed expenses in Q2 and the 30% growth in Q3 is driven mainly by FX a major rally [ph]. Taking all these accounts, we expect adjusted -- we expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be around 20% higher than last year. Given the strong level of bookings to be seen, we are updating our commentary for the full year. We currently expect gross bookings to grow slightly over 20%, up from our previous expectation for low teens growth. We expect full-year room night growth in the mid-teens and constant currency ADR -- constant currency accommodation ADRs up slightly for the year, including a couple of points of pressure from changes in regional mix. We currently expect revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to increase year-over-year by about 20 basis points, down from our previous expectation of 50 basis points increase. The reduction in our full-year take rate is driven by less of a benefit from timing including due to the high growth rate we expected than earlier in this year and also due to expanded booking window, and also from stronger performance, which drove a higher mix of flights than we expected earlier in the year.

We currently expect market and merchandising as a percentage of gross bookings to be slightly below 2022, as compared to our previous expectation for it to be similar to 2022. The improvements in our expectation is driven primarily by higher ROIs in our paid channels. We currently expect our more fixed expenses to grow about 25%, up from our previous expectation for around 20%. The increase in our expectation is driven primarily by variable components of personnel expense due to the overperformance versus expectations at the start of the year, as well as high indirect taxes, which are generally tied to revenues and some additional FX pressure. The manage our more fixed expenses very carefully and continue to expect our more fixed expenses next year to grow at an appreciably lower rate than this year. We continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA margins will expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we are pleased with our USA results and the momentum in the business that we moved into Q3.

We'll now move to Q&A. Adam, can you please open the lines.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is open.

Q - Lloyd Walmsley{BIO 15125459 <GO>}
Great, thanks. Two, if I can. First, thanks for some of the color on the gen A AI Trip Planners you guys have rolled out. I'm wondering how you guys think about that strategically and balance that with what search engines are doing? Do you think this brings you guys more direct traffic or do you think when you look at what some other players like Google are doing with their new search experience, like how that might change traffic flows in the travel space? And then second one, you mentioned marketing ROI improvements and efforts to improve efficiency, is that a function of just making higher ROI targets or just other changes you're making within marketing, any commentary you can give there would be great? Thanks.

A - Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
Hi, Lloyd. Why don't I take the first one about AI and then I'll let David talk about marketing and ROIs. So, first and -- while it's an easy answer, it's the true answer, which is nobody knows yet how this very new technology generative AI -- how that's going to play out in the long run, that's one. Two, even though we don't know how it's going to come out, we know it's very important that we continue to do everything we can to explore, experiment, see what might be very helpful to our travelers and to our supply partners to along with internally to do things better internally for us.

Every company is doing that including the big search engine like Google. They're coming out, what they can do. And nobody knows. A couple of things though. I am fairly certain that history provides a good roadmap, and that is, there will be changes, but companies that are able to adapt quickly, be agile, have great technology experts will benefit from these kinds of changes. We saw it as things for example, like when the mobile phone came out, we were able to adapt quickly, adjust and we got -- I think a very good advantage from that. I think that we will hopefully get the same type of benefits as this new technology generative AI comes out.

But one thing I didn't mention for in the prepared remarks was, I mentioned all the comments, I didn't mentioned Agoda. So Agoda is doing some very good things in terms of internally how can we use Gen AI to become more efficient wiht all types of code, co-pilot type systems. So, there are a lot of different things that we're playing with all at once. I'm really happy the way that we're doing it from different directions, having price slide, doing it at the bottom of the policy, how that works, doing Booking.com's AI Trip Planner at the top, see how that's doing there. The chat GBT plug-in, from OpenTable, and from KAYAK.

So being able to do all these things from different brands and being able to learn from each other, what works, what doesn't work, where to put more emphasis, where should we put less emphasis. I think that will help us have an advantage over many other companies they may not have the scale, the experts, the -- basically the capital to put into what could be a very, very exciting future for us. We'll see how it plays out and of course, nobody knows how regulations are going to play into this. And that is something that could affect everybody. And David, I don't know if you want to talk about marketing ROIs?

A - David Goulden{BIO 1477167 <GO>}
Yeah, sure, thank you and I will. Lloyd, thanks for the questions. So first of all, let's clarify that this is not a change in our approach relative to our desire to leading this year to recovering travel market, it was to leading in through a recovering travel market and you can see from our top-line numbers we're doing quite well. So that hasn't -- that hasn't changed and marketing and merchandising investment in total will still be higher this year than it was in 2019. It's kind of goes hand-in-hand with our leading comment. What I would say and what you're saying is within that all envelop as we look for ways to optimize our marketing spend, we've done a little bit more optimization than we expected. It's not going into all the components where that's happening, but we're looking at channels -- the incrementality channels for return to direct things like that consistently testing across a very large marketing spend. You see that during the quarter, we spent about $1.8 billion on marketing. So it's a large amount of money that we're spending across that spectrum. We're always looking for ways to optimize different spend, different channels and different approaches. So it's really more to do with our ongoing effort to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend, but again, within the context there was still a leading and looking to take share as the market continues to recover from COVID.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is open.

Q - Mark Mahaney{BIO 3027058 <GO>}
Okay, two questions please. First, Glenn, have you noticed any changes in the type of travel demand and -- I mean, short versus longer stay, rural suburban versus urban? And then I want to ask the CFO question on AI, which is, when you think about the impact that AI had and Gen AI could have on the business from a financial perspective, do you think that -- that's, Dave, do you think that's more likely to be on the monetization side or on the cost-efficiency side, and I'm sure you're going to say both. But if you could be a little bit more, if you have any more specifics on which of those you think could be more impacted by the application of Gen AI over time? Thanks a lot.

A - Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
Hi, Mark. I'm smiling because, I want to do number two first and just say both (multiple speakers). So this is a question that comes up a lot, because -- and I mentioned in the last call about how I'm always looking for the smoke signals, there is something changing and some of the key things I'm always looking at are people trading down in terms of star ratings or our people going for a lower length of stay or our people shifting to areas that may be cheaper travel that what previously was more expensive travel, always looking for some sort of early warning signal that something is happening, and I do not see that yet. I do not see that any of those areas, and that's what we're seeing right now.

In terms of the AI, it's a very interesting question and of course, if we knew the answer, we would have a good sense rush, we put in most of our investment dollars in our people, put them into the area kind of give us the best return. But the thing is, as I mentioned in the first question, nobody knows the answer to these things. These are all just guesses. So at this stage, it's very important to spread the bets around to see where the trends are coming, see where we want to put people to work, put money to work and see what's going to come back. The DNA of our company has always been experiment, see what works and keep pushing in what's better -- working better than other areas. So we're going to be doing a lot of different experimentation, and I think that's going to go on for some time before we really have a good sense of where the best returns are. I think in the long-run, of course, all the things -- the above things you mentioned are going to give tremendous benefits to everybody, but as you're correctly asked the question, at which things first and how much of that is not known yet.

Q - Mark Mahaney{BIO 3027058 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open.

Q - Justin Post{BIO 3469195 <GO>}
Great, thanks for taking my question. Obviously very strong in Asia. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and are you able to take some share from direct bookings at hotels are competitors? And then, I think your marketing ROI comment was very interesting in a very crowded quarter for marketing spend. So can you talk about -- is it the direct traffic, that's helping to be more judicious with your marketing spend or how you're getting there way up?

A - Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
So, I'll let David speak second about if he wants to give any more color into the marketing question. I was -- and probably with Asia. So, yes, very pleased with Asia. Very nice to see the second quarter numbers and even nicer to see July accelerating like that, that's great. And obviously that's a function of Asia took more time to recover the restrictions dropped later year-over-year comps. So we're getting some benefit out of that. And by the way, just so everybody is no confusion China is still not producing significantly or far behind in terms of outbound recovery and we are much more outbound player there. And, I don't expect recovery in China for us for some time a significant time probably. So overall, it's good. There are lot of factors happening there. There are very similar to other parts of the world where people wanted to travel. They're going out there, they're doing it and we have done a very good job, the same way we did in the US and we did in Europe is making sure that when people wanted to travel, we were there for them and we're seeing the results right there. And David, if you want to give any more color to that marketing question?

A - David Goulden{BIO 1477167 <GO>}
Yeah, Justin, I think I gave a fair amount in my first answer. So I'm not going to repeat it. You did ask about what a direct mix plays, and this as well. And yes, obviously, is our direct mix is increasing as we commented, it continues to do so. That helps, but we're also getting help from just looking across our total spend on marketing. And looking at pockets of efficiency using some of the variables like I talked about earlier.

Great. Thanks a lot. Could you give us an update on your efforts and progress in North America vacation rental market, where you're at on that initiative? Thank you.

A - Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
Hi, Kevin. So I'm very pleased that we're continuing to advance while we talked about the overall -- we'll call alternative accommodations, the way we define that area. We talked globally about our 11% growth being faster than the 9% for the overall company, the low percent was Booking.com number. But in terms of Northern America specifically are less reduced to the US, which is the area where, I think we all are more focused on. We've said many, many times, I've said many, many times that scenario is focus for us. We know we underindexed. We know there areas we had improved the product and we talked in the last call the (inaudible) for that too probably about the things we're doing to improve and that is both on the supply side, making sure we're improving things so that people own homes, people manage apartments, people who are in the space, who say I'm sorry but Booking.com, you're not doing certain things that you need to do for me. I'm glad that we're doing those things and they will then be willing and are being published on our -- on other properties on our platform, that's great. Then on the other side, as I talked about last time is the importance. Okay, we got the properties, now we got to make sure people know about and I talked last time again about awareness and that we need to bring that up to. This is not a thing we saw overnight. This was day-by-day, step-by-step grind it out and that's what we're doing in all the different areas and we're seeing the progress. So -- are we there yet? No, not even close to there yet. But the good thing is we're making the progress and that's all upside for us down the road. So we're going to keep on plugging away at it. I think will continue to experience good returns as we continue to invest in the area.

Q - Doug Anmuth{BIO 5591566 <GO>}
Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk about where you're seeing the biggest impacts of Connected Trip and how big of an impact do you think that's happening in terms of your outsized growth in the quarter? And then just switching to mobile, the 48% of our room nights booked through the apps, anything you can share in terms of better frequency and loyalty among those app users? Thanks.

A - Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
I'll leave the second one to what David wants to actually reveal in that area of specifically. I'm not sure if he does or doesn't. Regarding the Connected Trip couple of things on that, so let's start off right at the start that the Connected Trip is not producing material numbers increases in our -- what we're doing right now. The good numbers that we're showing right now are not because of the Connected Trip and it's just too small to show that. Imagine, we're building it in arch and so every piece is in place, in that case a lot of advantage from this arch. Right now, we are building the arch. So you see parts of it that are showing up, but not that big effect. So for example, really happy about one element, which is you have to have a flight product and we're doing 58% year-over-year growth in tickets in flight, that's great for -- I mean, that's a really good number. It shows that we're producing a good flight product, we'll get that going.

And then the other areas that we have to build out like -- things like the attractions, things like the rights part to get people from the hotel to airport or from your home to the airport, things like that, building all those things out. And then of course the glue, payments. That's very important to make sure the whole thing is working correctly or able to give benefits value to both the traveler and the name of our suppliers have an opportunity to give types of benefits, so they'll win that deal. These are things we need payments to do and we're making great progress and we're really happy to see that number up there that 48% in the growth from last year. So all these elements are being worked on. But that is not what's producing the very good returns in Q2. Well flip side of that says, look at all the potential future we have down the road, that's really encouraging to me. So I'm very happy where we are. I'm glad with the progress we're making, but it should not be -- it should not be missed thought that this is the thing that's produced Q2's numbers. And David, I don't know if you want to talk about mobile app anything there in terms of repeat.

A - David Goulden{BIO 1477167 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, Glenn, I will. So -- sorry Doug, you're going to ask questions?

Q - Doug Anmuth{BIO 5591566 <GO>}
No. Go ahead, David.

A - David Goulden{BIO 1477167 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you. So in terms of when you think about what's happening with the app, there are basically three ways that people interact with us directly. They can come through the app, they can come to us directly on the desktop device or and comes to us directly on mobile device. And out of those three, not too surprisingly, the app is the stickiest channel in terms of frequency and loyalty, as you mentioned, which is why obviously app is now a very high percentage of direct, has become an increasing percentage of direct and we think that that's a good thing. Relative to differences in -- brings the loyalty we are not in a position to enter those today, but it is definitely our best channel in terms of frequency and loyalty.

A - Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
And Doug, one other thing I would like to add to this is, Doug is the importance of the app and the Connected Trip. It's -- it's one of the important parts along with the other ones because one of the things that we really believe it's important when you're traveling is to get in price deals of all sorts of things that you want to have your travel agent in your pocket. Well, in your phone, that is the travel agent in the pocket. And then you throw on top of this, all the G&A AI stuff all that. There is some real potential opportunities down the road that when people are traveling, they're going to have a much better experience than they have had in the past and that's what I'm looking for down the road.

Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Q - Lee Horowitz{BIO 22490100 <GO>}
Great, thanks. Your direct booking mix improvement remains impressive. I guess, can you help us unpack what drove the acceleration and mix towards direct in the quarter, something specific on your -- I know you guys have been doing, that drove that improvement quarter-on-quarter and how should we think that being replicated going forward? And then secondly, are we getting to a point where direct mix may fully offset your growth into lower-margin business and thus over time allow you to actually walk margins back towards 2019 levels? Just any commentary there in terms of direct mix and margins over time will be helpful? Thanks so much.

A - Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
Hi, Lee, I'll let David talk about whether or not he wants to talk about where the margin may go with that. But I'll talk just in general, why do we continue quarter-to-quarter, it seems to be improving our direct mix. And I believe the reason is because people like the product, that's the thing that helps. If they use it, they decided to come back because we've given the best prices, so we are going to most selection, the greatest selection. We're making it easier for them to do it and we're providing great customer service if something goes wrong we the fix it. The reason I use -- I'm not going to list some other retail -- online retailers, (inaudible) was that, I use (inaudible) cash and I do it because it's better. I mean in the end that's what wins. It's customers' interest. They come back with a better product, when that people believe in trust is the reason people are loyal to a brand that's what we're building here and I believe that's why we are slowly incrementally building out that direct mix. I think that's the biggest thing for me. David, you can add, if you want to add anything to that. And also, I'm not sure what you want to add about in terms of margins, where people come directly what that may do in the long run to our margin profile -- EBITDA margin profile.

A - David Goulden{BIO 1477167 <GO>}
Yeah, Lee. We obviously got mix is very helpful for business and of course we're talking about here, really direct mix in our accommodation business scale up our core business. And we mentioned before that we believe that we can continue to improve margins a little bit from where they were in 2023, but we're not trying to walk them all the way back to where they were in 2019, we will have significant businesses. The are lower-margin businesses than we had in 2019, when we have a large price business, we're moving towards having a large payment business. So direct mix can obviously offset some of the pressure in the business, but don't expect it to walk our margins back to 2019, that's not what we've talked about, but we do believe it's one of the factors that can lead us to have continued improvement from where we are now.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Q - Eric Sheridan{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Thank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe against your broader long-term goals for growth that you called out earlier in your comments, we'd love to get any update about how you're feeling about supply growth with respect to shared accommodations and/or local experiences against continue to diversify supply and build out more elements of the Connected Trip, and how do those factor in as elements of investment beyond 2023, looking out into next year? Thanks so much.

A - Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
Hi, Eric. So the important thing is always priorities. What's the most important thing? And we've mentioned numerous times in terms of our alternative accommodations, how important it is to continue to build out the supply there. We have a large number of listings that's true, and cover them many times though, you have to have the right type of listing in the right locations. And we talked in the past, it's not done yet. In the US getting the right accommodations in the right places so that we will come, they have something to buy. That's very important, that's top priority. When you shift down to something like attractions, not as important right now, it's important, but it's not as high priority, it's getting now for accommodation, that's one of most critical thing is making sure we're spending the time, energy, effort, money in the place and they're going is the best return. We have good attraction from third-party connections, we have the key ones and someday it will be important to build out further along that. But for right now for this year and next year, I want to make sure that we're going to have a bigger bang for the buck, which is making sure we have the right number and the right types of alternative accommodations on our platform.

Our next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.

Q - Jed Kelly{BIO 16722477 <GO>}
Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to the US business,you highlighted up mid single digit growth in the US. Can you talk about how that's trending -- how that's trending relative to your competitors? And does that number -- does that capture the amount of Americans traveling over to Europe or is that including in your European room nights? Thank you.

A - Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
Yeah, David, I'll let you go on both. I mean, I'm not sure what you want to talk about in terms of us versus competitors or not.

A - David Goulden{BIO 1477167 <GO>}
Yeah, let me clarify. First of all, when we talk about these reasons I -- on a geography basis, we're talking about on a booker basis. So yes, Jed, it does -- it does capture bookings being made by US travelers, including those that are moving overseas, which is one of the reason probably getting growth. We mentioned that we're back to basically a single-digit growth in July in the US. After seeing a very, very small decline in growth in Q2 and actually that was really just April and May. By the time we got to June, we're back to growth as well and then April-May comparisons really due to -- the really strong rebound we saw in 15 months, when all clear was declared from Omicorn last year. So we got a little bit of funky comparison on that. So I think we're doing -- we're doing well in the marketplace.

It's too early to have call, how we see us doing any -- against the market for a single quarter. We like to kind of look at that on a longer-term basis and look at how the year pans out. I would just point out how is it relative to the market. We mentioned in July, win over 30% growth in the US versus 2019, significantly well has any market data points. Market is perhaps closer to breakeven, maybe slightly positive compared to 2019, we're up third. So we tend to look at over the longer period of time and we'll have a better view on exactly how we're doing in the US relative to the market as the year develops and as the end]. As Glenn mentioned, we're pleased with many other programs there. We also note, lot of upside for us to continue to push more into the US marketplace.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Brignall with Redburn. Your line is open.

Q - Alex Brignall{BIO 18775276 <GO>}
Hi guys, thank you very much for taking the question. I just have one on the full year guidance. Obviously, the big change there is (technical difficulty) the revenue divided by growth for spin-up only 0.2% year-on year. So could you just talk a little bit about how that will manifest next year? Obviously, pulling forward some bookings bring forward the marketing and also that will have the impact on EBITDA, but can you talk about the longer-term dynamic, presumably that has no impact on 2024 and on the margin trajectory to see going-forward? Thank you.

A - David Goulden{BIO 1477167 <GO>}
Yeah, I'll probably take that. So yes, I mean we pulled out on the -- in the prepared remarks. There were factors that are causing us to. Take the guidance to take rates to cool our number down a little bit from where we were before. And actually bodes well (inaudible) good things happening within the business. The first is that the business is growing faster and the booking window has elongated compared to where we thought we'd be this year, which means that we're not at all the benefit from timing recovery this year. Some of that timing recovery will be delayed into next year.

So that we should get back as a positive that piece of the reduction will get back as opposed to next year, but the fact of why is this growing faster than we expected is also putting a little bit of pressure on margin, but as Glenn said, that's a good thing as well, because we are building out more capabilities and more opportunities to work with our customers across Connected transactions. So those are the two main dynamics, one of which we will get back-in terms of timing recovery, which we thought would happen this year, will now happen more like the two years.

Q - Alex Brignall{BIO 18775276 <GO>}
Okay, that's really helpful, David. Thank you. As a follow-up, one of the things that obviously changes that some of your marketing dollars, which come below the revenue line have turned into merchandising dollars above the revenue line. And so it seems really like that revenue line is very, very hard to model. If we were to think of things in terms of EBITDA divided by gross bookings, is there any meaningful reason why your core business, so the accommodation business outside of payments in flights nor does the sort of businesses that dilute that figure, should not see a return to pre-COVID profitability if not improvement if you increase direct mix. So, I just think accommodation EBITDA divided by gross bookings, is there any reason why actually less profitable in the future than it was before COVID?

A - David Goulden{BIO 1477167 <GO>}
That's obviously a different way of looking at the EBITDA margin than we typically do. But you're right, obviously some of the revenue because of merchandise is impacting the revenue line. The dynamics will obviously help, overcome pressures in the accommodation business. Obviously, it seems like alternatives become slightly bigger, similarly Asia become slightly bigger. So when we've talked about the long-term model for the business, I assume that the core accommodation business can get back to in the rough region, where it was in 2019-ish and then the impact on EBITDA margins in the overall business was driven by a mix of some of the newer businesses or become quite large in terms of particularly payments and flights, neither which were a major factor in 2019. What I would point though, So we just step-back further and say what we've committed to for our long term (inaudible), I think is very important, compared to 2019, is we have a business that is larger on the topline and the bottomline and growing faster on the topline and the bottom line than it did in 2019. And that I think is the overall commitment that we've made or we'll be very committed to assist you, single help trying to think will help drive your thinking about the overall model.

Q - Alex Brignall{BIO 18775276 <GO>}
So I guess its closer to (technical difficulty) the additional businesses as incremental to your core business?

A - Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
That's the way to think about buildings and more (inaudible) look at our future EBITDA, yes?

Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citigroup. Your line is open.

Q - Ronald Josey
Great. Thanks for taking the question and really helpful to hear all the stats and see everything go as well this quarter. Glenn, I wanted to take you back maybe a year ago. We talked about growing bookings share of annual spend per customer. And as we see direct bookings increases -- increase, the Connected Trip rise, AI Trip Planner is launched, just talk to us about the progress of just gaining share that annual spend per customer, any updated goals there? Thank you.

A - Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
So Ron let me try and say the question. You're saying the annual spend per customer, is that right?

Q - Ronald Josey
So percentage share of travel spend, yes. I think we talked about getting like 25% the year goes and...

A - Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
Yeah, yeah, right. so clearly, part of the issue is that our customers I'm happy about thiis. They don't always use us, sometimes use a competitor and we see that. We see that unfortunately more than I'd like. Part of it is not having a product that they want, that's one thing, which we're building out this year as we talked a little bit about. And the other thing is proximate things there -- they go for example internationally, I'll go for this brand and to Mexico that one. The key thing for us is develop that loyalty. The reason that somebody really thinks that they will come to us for any travel will come to us. So part of it, bring all this together with the Connected Trip, bring it altogether with payments, developing, the more we learn about the customer with their permission, of course, and then providing them with the -- what they may want more than anyone else. So they will always come back to ensure this. What do I believe in the end, it could be -- do I believe, in the end, we could have all customers all the time, of course, not. But, I hope that we can continue to improve this substantially in the long-run. And we'll see that as we've given it a finish off some of these areas that we're still building out. Things like making sure we have enough of those alternative accommodation peoples only wants and where we have one. Its like making sure that we have the payment product that they want to use -- the payment system that many things around the world we've talked about, they don't use Visa card, they don't use Mastercard. They only use Meridian [ph] Express. They got other ways they want to pay, make sure we have that payment for him so that -- that traveller customer feels comfortable using us. And I can go on and on and on with many other things. That's what we need to do. How high do, I think it can be, I'm not going to get that. I just know it can be substantially better than we are right now.

Q - Scott Devitt{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I had two please. The first one, I'm just wondering, Glenn in terms of -- anything you can speak to in terms of shift in travel trends. We spent a lot of discussion around shoulder-month, travel April-May, August-September. Because we're not working, elevated prices. When, I hear you guys talk about the months, I don't necessarily see that in what you're saying, but it may be related to comps, but I'd just love to hear your perspective on shoulder month travel first? And then secondly, now that there is a new loyalty program in the market, I was just wondering your thoughts on Genius and how you're thinking of the current offering relative to competing programs now in the market? Thank you.

A - Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
Sure, so yeah, it used to be easy, shoulder and it was peak and life was easy to understand, and that's how it used to be and it's not like all. And (inaudible) I think is confusing right now when you have Omicron circling the world, in some it's hitting and then a year later, that's the year, the comp against. So it gets very, very confusing. As David was pointing out in the numbers how something could look, something but actually, it's much more understandable to all that they had COVID net area last year, or they just opened up last year. Curious, to think, I hope that next year, things will turn back to a more normalized, ease to understanding, and what the seasonality of travel is. However, there is a new thing that's come in, and it's the [ph] idea of people not going all the place remember and then they're also traveling more.

So they're using this Monday and Friday where they're traveling more for these longer weekends et cetera or perhaps a whole week, et cetera, and I think that's going to be more -- more uncertainty to see what that is. What that may end-up doing is evening out of travel throughout the year more where people are able to use time in areas that used to be shoulder season, but now people are using more, which I'll spread out the travel more. I don't know, but we'll find out, that's -- I can't change any that. So nothing to worry about too much. Well the uses in the near-term is what signals we see in the near terms is what signals we see should spend in the marketing or not. And in the long-run, what we hope is to improve the products, because that's the way in the long run to win. That's how we'll do. I'm sure lots -- we are going to have want to guess about what the seasonality trends are going to be for the next couple of years globally. I'm not going to try and -- and try and do that. You had -- you had another question, I believe, I forgot though?

Q - Scott Devitt{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
Yeah Just Genius and your thoughts on Genius, whether competing product now in the market?

A - Glenn D. Fogel{BIO 16619542 <GO>}
So there yeah.So, going all the way back to an American Airlines came out with our first loyalty plan. I'm actually old enough to remember, actually joined all the way to now, there are lots of different loyalty plans, all different things and beyond travel for sure and another company comes out with a new one whatever that's nice, interesting. But the truth is, I love what we're doing on Genius. I think it's a great product and we're going to do even more with it.

One of the things that's really wonderful about it is that we use it with our partners together in a way to give benefit to both of us, making sure that is actually incrementally improving what's good for that partner along with of course, good for our customer traveler. Doing that is the way of any type of loyalty program should really work and that's something that, I think we've done a good job with and will continue to do it. Now when you do get on more benefits and -- in

More benefit that enables the supplier to give more opportunity to merchandise, give things that will be good for the traveler, so they can win that actual transaction and that's something we're going to continue to do. We've talked about how we've improved it from where it just started out and now we're upto three tiers. And there are lots of things down the road that will add as we continue to develop the Connected Trip that will give us the opportunity to give more benefit -- incremental benefits to both sides. I really don't worry too much about what somebody else is doing. I'm more concerned making sure we're executing right on the things that's important for our customers who are both travelers and suppliers.
