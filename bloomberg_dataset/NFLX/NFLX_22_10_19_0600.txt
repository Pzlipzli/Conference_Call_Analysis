Good afternoon and welcome to the Netflix Q3 2022 Earnings Interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of Finance, IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are Co-CEO, Reed Hastings; Co-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; COO and Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters; and CFO, Spence Neumann. Our interviewer this quarter is Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary.

With that let's jump into it. Doug, over to you for your first question.

Questions And Answers
Q - Doug Anmuth
Great. Thanks, Spencer and great to see all of you and thanks for having me join you again today. So let's jump-in with advertising, obviously a lot of discussion here, heading into the launch. You announced details for the new basic with ads to your last week launching in the US and 11 other markets. Can you help us understand how you arrived at the price point and the product features for basic with ads?

A - Greg Peters{BIO 17539678 <GO>}
Yeah, Doug. So, a lot of what we're thinking in terms of setting pricing for basic with ads and how we think about pricing in general anchors on what's the value that we're delivering consumers, we're trying to work very hard to translate the dollars that they give us and do incredible shows and you can see sort of in Q3 some great examples of the series that we're delivering there, the films, we're delivering there and the Q4 slate looks incredible as well. And then with specifically with regard to ads, we modeled out essentially what we think the expected revenue is on the variety of different countries that we're launching in to make sure that a combination of the subscription price that we're charging for basic with ads plus that anticipated monetization. We'd be roughly call it unit economics wise revenue positive to neutral and then when we look at then the fact that we think that this lower price will, consumer-facing price will bring in a lot more members then we're quite confident in the long-term that this will lead to a significant incremental revenue and profit stream.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay, and I guess just to clarify there when you talk about kind of getting neutral and perhaps more accretive over time. What are you comparing that to on a unit economic basis that's essentially more to the basic tier?

A - Greg Peters{BIO 17539678 <GO>}
Yeah, may be relevant to note that we don't see a lot of members switching plans. So oftentimes when they come in and they select the plan for given future let's say that's the 4K resolution. We see that to be a pretty sticky choice and so when we're thinking about unit economics being neutral to positive, we're really comparing to the like feature set-in the basic without ads.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay. Okay, great. So maybe you can talk a little bit about what gives you confidence in that advertising arm and how would you frame advertiser demand thus far. I know, Jeremy, last week talked about having hundreds of advertisers onboard and ad inventory almost sold out?

A - Greg Peters{BIO 17539678 <GO>}
Yeah, we started with a bunch of models that we're informed by obviously the ads activities in those different countries around the world, but now we're in the point where we did take those models and we get to bring them actually to advertisers and sort of see what's working in practice. It's been great to see both our partner and Microsoft and there are sales team as well as our small but crack ad sales team in actual action with brands and with agencies working through that. And I would say that the initial demand that we're seeing is very strong. So people are very excited about the proposition of bringing their brands and their ads to a bunch of consumers around the world that are watching our shows. They are excited about the positioning against the incredible content and the titles that we have and so that demand has been very, very strong. And so we're seeing sort of a lot of the expectations that we built into our models come through in that actual sales process. That's great. I think it's also worth noting though that we're very much in a walk, crawl, walk, run kind of model that we talked about before. We're sort of iteratively improving and so we're building in a lot of capabilities over the next couple of quarters that we think are important to advertisers to make that advertising offering increasingly attractive and sort of check a bunch of boxes they have. You might have seen the verification partners that we announced. That's a pretty good example of that. We got a lot more on that road map to go do that. We're excited about delivering for brands.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay. So in terms of those capabilities, targeting, obviously very important here as well. I think you've talked about having broad targeting by country and genre and I think within the top 10 shows and I believe you also asked for age and gender at the time of sign-up as well. Your early feedback from marketers and agencies has been that the targeting options at launch are fairly limited. What's your view on that and how will that targeting evolve over time?

A - Greg Peters{BIO 17539678 <GO>}
Yeah again, I think, we're starting -- part of what we want to do is actually get this out to market quickly and you can see we went from basically the point we announced it to delivering in about six months which has been testament to a lot of hard work on internal teams and to Microsoft, but we do have relatively basic targeting capabilities in terms of contextual targeting, genre, etcetera, but that's sort of consistent with what we see with television as well right and obviously now our job is to move from that into more of what we expect from a digital world where we have 100% signed-in audience, fully addressable fully targetable and so we can start to layer-in additional targeting capabilities over time. I think it's also worth noting when we talk about that, that we're very cognizant of privacy, and we want to make that paramount and how we think about this offering and all of the data that we use will just be used to basically deliver more relevant ads offering on Netflix and we're not using that data in anyway shape or form for profile building off Netflix or anything like that.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay. There's been a lot of discussion in the press about CPMs that are really two times to three times those of CTV or other AVOD players. Is that accurate and what justifies the much higher pricing for Netflix?

A - Greg Peters{BIO 17539678 <GO>}
I'm not going to comment on any specific pricing, but I would just say that I think we've got a very attractive offering and that's a combination of the audience that we have that we're delivering to that oftentimes -- it's hard to access in other ways, certainly harder to access in traditional TV, in many cases. And it's a result of the incredible content that we've got. Ted's team is doing an amazing job of producing titles that advertisers want to be next to and so that's I think what you see is driving the demand and the pricing that we can get.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay. You've talked in the past about wanting the ad offering to be innovative and somewhat different overtime. If we think about the range of four to five minutes of ads per hour, it's certainly lower. You've talked about type frequency capping. What else do you think is innovative at least in the initial offering and then how does that evolve more over time.

A - Greg Peters{BIO 17539678 <GO>}
Yeah, as you noted, we want to start with a experience that's very pro-consumer consumer-centric and so that's definitely informed both our ad load and thinking about the frequency capping. What I love about those things is the more we talk to brands and advertisers is actually a high degree of alignment between sort of what their desires are and what we think is great for consumers. So they're enthusiastic about not having high frequency caps and having sort of a -- sort of more unique offering there and also limited ad loads sets their ads apart you know more distinctly. So I think I love that alignment to begin with and then over time we're going to access a bunch of the capabilities that you've seen us leverage over the last 10 years to think about innovation in this space. So personalization I think is a great example where we don't needed to think about the ads experiences being uniform across all of our members and we think about, we can leverage the personalization capability that we've built in terms of titles and how we present titles and also in terms of how we present adds. So I think that's an exciting dimension that we're going to work on and additionally we're also excited to work with sort of partners and our advertisers to think about what is that ads experience, the ad format that is really best-suited for premium connected TV and we're starting with meeting the market where it's at today that's important to access sort of all the capabilities they've got, but we don't need to stay there and I think we're looking-forward to over a couple of years understanding what is the right native format for premium connected TV and figuring out what that looks like.

A - Spence Neumann
Hey, Doug, I might just add also just part of the innovation was just for us the business innovation of speed-to-market. As Greg said getting from announced to launch within six months and to doing so in every region in which we operate. So 12 markets that represent well over half of our revenue today. So part of it is just that nimbleness and speed, which hopefully will bring to our innovation paths going forward as well.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay. In terms of subscribers, how do you think about just this concept of kind of new net-adds versus trade-down from existing subs on the basic with ads. It's obviously a pretty frequent discussion with investors.

A - Greg Peters{BIO 17539678 <GO>}
Yeah, again, I think it's important just to reiterate that we don't see a lot of plans switching on the existing plan set. So that's I think worthwhile point to note and then obviously as we stated before we're not really trying to steer our members to one plan or another. We're trying to take a pro-consumer approach and sort of let them find and land on the right plan for them. And as we stated we modeled out that expected performance on ads monetization and factor that into our thinking around price point for the basic with ads. And so we really anticipate that this is going to be a pro-consumer model that will be more attractive bring more members in because the consumer pricing price is low, but then again the economics and the revenue will be fine as a result even if some of those consumers switch plans. And again just to restate this when you factor in those extra members, we expect this leads to a significant incremental revenue and profit stream.

Q - Doug Anmuth
And how do you think about the impact in terms of reducing churn and perhaps how that plays out across some of the different markets given different characteristics and levels of penetration?

A - Greg Peters{BIO 17539678 <GO>}
Yeah I think generally what we've seen is that obviously lower price helps with churn and so we think that there'll be some positive dynamics there, but again we really -- we're in early days now and we've got to launch this thing and we'll learn so much more over the months to come.

A - Ted Sarandos{BIO 4812832 <GO>}
Doug, and so much of that is tied to engagement. I mean the best way to reduce churn is to keep them entertained.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Right which you've clearly done in this past quarter and we'll talk more about that in a minute. At the Code Conference last month, Sundar said that the Netflix Microsoft ad deal is one of the biggest ad deals ever. Are there any particular components of the deal that give you confidence in the advertising revenue outlook here and how it compares to subscription over time?

A - Greg Peters{BIO 17539678 <GO>}
Well one of the big factors for us in picking Microsoft is that we felt like we were highly strategically aligned. They had an approach was similar to ours which is that we want to launch and then learn quickly and iterate quickly and there was a lot of flexibility both in terms of innovation around the formats and approaches that we just talked about. Partly was a lot of flexibility and thinking about how do we leverage the combined go-to-market capability that Microsoft has a lot of right now and we have very little, but we're going to build over time and frankly when I see the demand that we're in right now. We're stretched between the two teams to really support all that. So I'm actually excited about our ability to grow that capacity on the Microsoft side. I think they're going to do some hiring and building and we're going to do some hiring and building and then through that joint capacity growth be able to better serve more advertisers which we can even actually we're turning some folks away right now because we just don't have the go-to-market capacity to serve everyone.

A - Reed Hastings{BIO 1971023 <GO>}
And Doug at that same conference Bob Iger said that linear TV was going off a cliff.

Q - Doug Anmuth
He did.

A - Reed Hastings{BIO 1971023 <GO>}
And what we under -- what I underappreciated was just the impact on advertisers. They're just being able to reach fewer people and then the 18 to 49 demographic is even faster than the decline in pay TV. So this is what is really fueling the cycle is that really collapse of linear TV as an advertising vehicle outside of a few properties like sports.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Reed, maybe that just brings up the question and for you as well, Greg. I mean, when you're going out to agencies and marketers do you really do you feel like you're going after linear TV dollars or you're going after digital dollars right now?

A - Greg Peters{BIO 17539678 <GO>}
I'd say when you look at the capabilities of the current offering that we have as a publisher. I think we're mostly competitive with linear, right now. Obviously I think that will build into that over time and a lot of what makes digital attractive will be part of our offering as we go. Obviously I think when you think about sort of demand capture and those direct response ads versus sort of the more brand side. We're probably going to be leaning for some time more into that brand side of things where we can be more competitive, but I think those roles are going to blur over time realistically and our job is to be highly competitive with the components the technical components that we can add-in in terms of targeting, etcetera. But also then be very competitive because we have really incredible content and incredible audience that advertisers want to connect with.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay. And Spence in terms of ad revenue, it feels like it should be very high margin. Maybe you can just talk about some of the key costs or investments in running the ad business given that Microsoft is responsible for the bulk of ad sales for now?

A - Spence Neumann
Yeah, I agree, Doug again we need to build this out over time as Greg said on a unit economic basis, we feel good that this will be kind of net neutral to positive out-of-the-gates and then when you add-in the incrementality on subscribers we think we can build a big incremental revenue and profit stream. So there are some costs obviously there is some cost to our partnership with Microsoft there is some cost of building out our side of the internal team to kind of buildout our capabilities with Jeremy and Peter and then obviously some other cost here and there, but overall I'm not going to get into specifics, but we believe this can be margin accretive over certainly margin accretive over time. It's going to be pretty small out-of-the gates it's kind of reflected in our Q4 guidance as you can see. It's an intra-quarter launched. We're not expecting any material, financial impact in this first partial quarter but we'll will build over-time and it will be additive to the business.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay. Great. All right so for the record we're not hitting subscriber numbers until about 15 minutes in here. So but you added 2.4 million subs in the third quarter you're expecting 4.5 million in 4Q. Maybe you can just kind of walk us through how you're feeling about core subscriber growth before you kind of get into the dynamics in '23 around advertising and page sharing.

A - Reed Hastings{BIO 1971023 <GO>}
Well thank God we're done with shrinking quarter. That's a big feeling of -- we're back to the positivity. Obviously this quarter and the guidance for Q4 are reasonable not fantastic, but reasonable and then we got to pick-up the momentum everything the company is focused on whether that's on the content side, on marketing lowering prices to the ad-supported the paid sharing the thoughtful approach we're doing there lines us up for a good next year we still got FX. So that's a huge hit. As we've explained so that's not going to go away, but other than that all the stars are lining up very well for us. Spence, you want to add to that?

A - Spence Neumann
Yeah, I mean, you're doing a job for me which is great. I appreciate that but yes we're, as Reed said, we're not -- we're still not growing as fast we'd like. So we're building momentum we're pleased with our progress but we know we've got a lot more work to do. We're pleased with Q3. We saw acquisition growth a bit more than we had in the past few quarters which is great across every region. Churn remained, yes, slightly elevated kind of similar to where we were at the end of Q2, but overall when you combine those two things we delivered paid net-ads of 2.4 million which is little bit above our guide. So we kind of under forecast there obviously and then for Q4 as we've talked about and as Reed mentioned we're guiding to 4.5 million paid net-adds reflected in that guide is where we talked about we're off to a nice start. I'm sure Ted will talk about the strength of the content slate. We started with Monster, The Jeffrey Dahmer Story and into Watcher and others that are building. So it's a strong seasonal quarter, but some of those revenue accelerators that we know we're focused on in the near-term whether it's ads we just talked a bunch about that there's not going to be -- we don't expect at least a big financial impact in this first launch quarter and we also as we talked about in the letter we have a solution that will be rolling out in '23 for paid sharing and monetizing all that unpaid viewing. We've been talking about but again that doesn't even start rolling out until early '23 there is some other near-term limiters to our growth on take currency out and we still have penetrating the connected TV market in the sales cycle there we got competition, we got some macro strain whether it's higher inflation, energy prices and some of the geopolitical strain around the world. So all those things are factored into our guide. It's a little bit less visibility than we typically would see, but overall we feel really good that we're building that momentum. We set a path to the growth. You're seeing growth in paid net-ads, both in actuals for Q3 and into the guide to Q4 and most importantly a path to accelerate revenue growth and hit the ground running in '23.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay great. You had your two biggest English language series ever. I think in the span of three to four months with Stranger Things S4 and Dahmer. Do you believe the content cadence is becoming more normalized to your post pandemic and how much of a factor where those titles in driving 3Q subs and now more momentum into the fourth quarter?

A - Ted Sarandos{BIO 4812832 <GO>}
Big, big shows that folks engage with and talk about drives a lot of growth. I do think it's the people come to value that. And for us, our goal is we've got to get them to come to expect it. So right after they finish something great that they love, that there's an expectation that there's something ready right behind it. So you described it pretty nicely. You come out of Stranger Things Season Four, you roll right into a big movie like Gray Man or a movie that you fall in love with, like Purple Hearts or a great animated feature like Sea Beast. And you know with that and you roll right into Monster, The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. And then right into that, I mean, back to back hits from Ryan going right into the Watcher. So I think that cadence is something I do think we're getting better at. As you know, as we get more and more mature in our creation of original content. Remember, Doug, we've only been at it for ten years.

A - Spence Neumann
And the other thing is -- Oh, go ahead, Reed. Sorry.

A - Reed Hastings{BIO 1971023 <GO>}
Ted, maybe just talk a little about the smoothing of content monthly kind of what state we're at this year, what you think we can get to next year sort of easing out of that COVID concentration?

A - Ted Sarandos{BIO 4812832 <GO>}
Yeah, the COVID got a lot of content jammed up in later parts of the year and then at that impact rolls out and rolls out because even when people are getting back to normal work, they were all working on those projects during COVID. So it takes it'll take several years to completely unwind the COVID logjam. And historically, Q4 tends to be a little heavier than Q1 and Q2, mostly because of the historical legacy of the fall TV series and the fall film cycles with film festivals and award cycles and all those things that are kind of unnatural to viewers watching. So we're trying to be more and more aggressive about smoothing that out to make sure that the content is available when people are ready to watch it.

A - Spence Neumann
And just to add to that, it's really kind of smoothing it out across all of our content categories. So there's always something great to watch, whatever your mood or taste and even just to build on Ted's point, it's not just kind of the English language titles and I'm sorry if I missed some of what he said, but even if you think of the last in this last quarter, whether it's every region, you know, Sintonia in Brazil, the Empress in Germany, High Water in Poland, Narco-Saints in Korea, more and more of those big local titles with big local impact as well that can that also have the ability to travel. So it's really kind of getting that cadence in every country and region around the world.

A - Ted Sarandos{BIO 4812832 <GO>}
And probably none was a better example this go around then Extraordinary Attorney Woo from Korea. You know 400 million hours of watching around the world. Just the real phenomena that we can take a show that folks would view as being extraordinarily Korean and make it work around the world.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay, Ted, there's a lot of discussion just around the philosophy, around content. And I guess the question is, is your process or selectivity changing at all in terms of the greenlighting of content? Does it need to?

A - Ted Sarandos{BIO 4812832 <GO>}
We go back to what I was saying earlier. We started this about ten years ago. We had no IP, we had no library. We moved as quickly as we could to build a library of our own IP and to build our own library. And in those ten years, that library now gets more viewing, more revenue and more profit than all of our competitors who've been at it for over a hundred. So and I look at that and think, okay, along the way we probably made a lot of mistakes and we learned a lot. So today, when I think about what we learned today, we've kind of developed a lot stronger skill sets and partnerships and processes to ensure quality of delivery and working with our creators and to give them the tools to deliver for the audience some things that are fairly proprietary and some things that just benefit from the scale of our business, so that they can really do what we want to do, which is please audiences. And you got to remember, as we go to do that, it isn't just making prestige shows in English. It's also making very kind of pop culture television across every genre, across every format imaginable. And in doing that, that's the thing that I think we can bring scale and creativity and audience connectivity that others can't compete with. So for me, that that's the biggest thing that when you say, are we sharpening our tools or are we getting better, we're definitely getting more mature about the process. And if you go all the way back to the beginning of time, we didn't have any staff who had any experience creating original anything on Netflix. So we built that up to where we're at today, which is, you know, in the last quarter, we released seven of our most popular releases of all time just in this last quarter.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay, great. You've talked last quarter about content Spence staying kind of flattish, around 17 billion or so number and annual cash spending. So I realized that, that's up this year when you kind of take out the incremental COVID costs from last year. But does the discipline around content spending push you to do anything differently? And I guess what's your confidence that you can deliver both the quantity and also the quality of content that you want within that number across all regions?

A - Ted Sarandos{BIO 4812832 <GO>}
Look, I think what we're seeing, Doug, is that both the scope and scale as well as the range and the cadence of hits is improving. So that I feel better and better about that 17 billion of content spend, because what we have to do is be better and better at getting more impact per billion dollar spend than anybody else. And that's how we're focusing on it. So I think we're about the right we're spending it about the right level. And as we reaccelerate revenue, we'll revisit that number, of course. But we're a pretty disciplined bunch about that.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay. The Knives Out sequel, Glass Onion, so pretty highly anticipated. You're going to release it in a limited number of theatres, I think for a week around Thanksgiving before hitting Netflix, I believe, on December 23rd. But there also seems to have been a push to perhaps run it for a longer period of time in theatres. So maybe you can just talk about some of the debate there, what the rationale is to just do it for one week. And how do you think that kind of release will drive viewership on Netflix?

A - Ted Sarandos{BIO 4812832 <GO>}
Well, first, I'll tell you, we're in the business of entertaining our members with Netflix movies on Netflix. So that's where we focus all of our energy and most of our spends. Our films are always heavily featured in film festivals around the world because they're in demand made by the greatest filmmakers on the planet. And for all those folks who can't get to a city where a festival is, this one week release on 600 screens is a way of creating access to the film and building buzz, the same thing we're doing in those festivals. So I would look at just another way to build anticipation for the film and build buzz and reputation for the film ahead of its Netflix release. There's all kinds of debates all the time back and forth, but there's no question internally that we make our movies for our members and we really want them to watch them on Netflix. And of course, with one week of release in theatres, most people will see them on Netflix just like they see all movies. Most people watch most movies at home. So we think that there's plenty. And I think this particular release sits somewhere between that week. We have to run movies to qualify for awards and the time that we run them in a film festival and the time that we travel them around. But it's a way of condensing that into a louder event.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Got it. Okay. Pretty clear. Let's shift gears a little bit. Talk about page sharing. You announced profile transfer yesterday, which facilitates non-paying members shifting their recommendations and history and other settings to a new account. Maybe you can talk about how this is a potential precursor to having borrowers kind of become either having their own accounts or adding to an existing member. And just how we should think about timing of the roll out there.

A - Greg Peters{BIO 17539678 <GO>}
Sure. The profile transfer, I mean, supports a couple of different use cases, right? I mean, there's obviously situations where you can imagine, like, you know, you have a kid at home who is going to go off and become an adult and get their own account. And it supports those ones. But it does enable a key thing that we learned around how we think about page sharing. And we've been, you know, working really hard to try and find essentially a balanced position, an approach towards this one that supports, you know, customer choice and frankly, a long history of customer centricity that we think is informed how we think about establishing our service, but balancing that with making sure that as a business we're sort of getting paid when we're delivering entertainment value to consumers. And, you know, as we try to deal with pretty much all of our product changes where we can, we try and try different approaches and listen to our members and use their reactions to help us understand what's working and what's not working. So we've tried a couple of different approaches in different countries. You saw that. And based on the customer feedback that we're getting, we sort of landed on an approach towards page sharing that we think strikes that balance. And a key component of that is the ability for borrowers, people that are using somebody else's account right now to access Netflix, to be able to create their own separate account. And part of that is transferring their profile and their viewing history and all the great information that basically informs hopefully great recommendations for them. And we think that, that sort of separate account path will be especially attractive in countries where we're launching that lower priced basic with ads plan, that lower price obviously makes that more attractive. Another component of this, though, is allowing account owners to be able to pay for Netflix for some friend or family, something they want to share the service with. And so they're able to create a sub account which we're calling extra member to enable that model to. So we're trying to come up with a range of options that supports customer choice, balances those considerations, but also ensures that we've got a sustainable business model that allows us to invest in more of that great entertainment that Ted's team has always focused on for all of our members. So we're looking forward to getting that out in early '23.

Q - Doug Anmuth
And do you think do you think extra member and kind of new accounts could that be bigger than advertising in 2023 for Netflix?

A - Greg Peters{BIO 17539678 <GO>}
I don't I won't say, you know, which is would be bigger or better. I think they're complementary in many ways. And what we're seeing is that there's a number of different consumer needs, right. Paying for Netflix for somebody that you want to share that service with, that's a legitimate need. You know, creating a lower price that balances out for us as a business with monetization from ads, that's a legitimate need to get to all the great content that we're making. So I just think of this as a range of options that try to speak to a range of different consumer needs, the right price points, the right feature set. And we're really just trying to do a better job at expanding that range so that we can serve more consumers on the planet in the right way.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay. Spence, maybe you could talk a little bit just about the decision to no longer provide guidance on subscribers starting next quarter.

A - Spence Neumann
Sure. Spencer, do you want to take that one or?

A - Spencer Wang{BIO 3251222 <GO>}
Sure. Happy to take it. I appreciate the question, Doug. So maybe just to start focusing on subscribers in our early days was helpful, but now that we have such a wide range of price points, different partnerships all over the world, the economic impact of any given subscriber can be quite different. And that's particularly true if you're trying to compare our business with other streaming services. So that's why we've been increasingly focused on revenue as our primary top line metric, as you've heard us talk about over the last several years. And this is going to be, I think, even more important as we head into 2023 and we develop new revenue streams like advertising and paid sharing, where membership growth is only one aspect of the revenue picture. So just to be clear, we will continue to report our global membership every quarter when we release earnings as well as the pay net adds. We'll also continue to disclose our regional membership as we do today. And in terms of our revenue guidance, you should expect that we'll give you some color on the underlying drivers of the revenue forecast, but we just won't provide a pinpoint paid net adds figure per se. And then lastly, we'll continue to provide guidance for all the other metrics, Doug, that we do today, namely revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS and share count. So in the grand scheme of things, pretty minor change.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay. That's great. That's helpful. If we look at the 4Q guide, 4% operating margin, it's heavily impacted by FX pressures. I think it's 10% ex-FX. And I guess on a year-over-year basis, kind of up from 8%. Maybe you can just talk about some of the factors there. Is there anything fundamental in terms of the business that's kind of perhaps weighing there a little bit more on 4Q margins or is it kind of all FX?

A - Spence Neumann
It's really all FX, Doug, as you said, I mean, year-over-year FX neutral, constant currency, we're actually up at a -- we'd be a 10% margin versus 8% prior 4Q. So it's -- the FX drag is significant. We mentioned in the letter, if we look at our you can do the math on our four quarters now and you kind of roll it out to a full year number, we're still holding to what we're calling FX neutral to the beginning of the year, January 1 of this year to that 19% to 20% margin range. FX neutral. You can you'll see it's actually is in the mid to higher end of that range. But on a reported basis, it's just a little over 17%. So there's about two and one half points of FX drag in our margin. That equates to about it's about $1 billion of revenue drag about $800 million of margin drag and the bulk of that is being felt in the fourth quarter as it's built up through the year.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay. And then I guess maybe you can just talk about cash content spending. Just to confirm, it sounds like you're kind of reiterating the same thing around the $17 billion type of level going forward. What does that mean for free cash flow generation over these next few years?

A - Spence Neumann
Yeah, so, as you said, it's -- we're kind of maintaining the guidance that we had. We think the 17 billion is about the right zip code plus or minus to spend as we're based on our current revenue trajectory, as Ted said, as we hope and expect to reaccelerate revenue will revisit those spend levels. But for now given all those learnings that Ted mentioned, we think we can deliver more member value per dollar of content spend than we have in the past. So we expect our content slate to get better and better each quarter and each year over the next couple of years. And the way that then translates to cash flow for this year, we're maintaining our roughly $1 billion of free cash flow guide, plus or minus a couple hundred million is there's always movement at the end of the year for timing and then next year for that free cash flow to substantially improve beyond that. So we expect it to be, you know, materially above the roughly 1 billion this year. We won't put a specific guide out now, but it will be significantly larger.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay, great.

A - Spencer Wang{BIO 3251222 <GO>}
Doug, we have time for about two last questions, please.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay. Reed, so you talked about according to Nielsen, right. Streaming time now surpasses both broadcast and cable. And of course, Netflix has played a major role here in driving that transition. What does this next period of streaming look like, in your view? Clearly more competitive, more ad supported, but how else do you think it evolves?

A - Reed Hastings{BIO 1971023 <GO>}
That's a great question, Doug. I mean, clearly us and Disney are investing heavily -- will be two big brands in the premium space. YouTube is very strong on connected TVs, so they will continue to grow. I think depending on how Sunday ticket lands at, you know, some Apple Amazon somewhere else, you'll start to see a bunch of people focus on sports and bringing that over to on demand. And then think of how mobile telephony just slowly replaced fixed line telephony, you know, and that was even before smartphones, right. Just in the convenience. And you're just going to see it grow every year for many years ahead. And, you know, it makes TV a lot more convenient, more enjoyable. And, you know, a smart TV now costs less than a mobile phone. You know, it doesn't have a battery. It's got a smaller processor. It's easier to manufacture. So smart TVs are getting ubiquitous and lower cost. You know, there was the supply chain slowdowns, but generally, I think you'll see around the world smart TVs continuing to get to, you know, every home in the world that has a TV. So that's all very positive vector. So again, think of it on basically pretty steady every year climbing share. And then, you know, a lot of us battling it out for do we have the best content in the world? Do we have the best suggestions in the world? The lowest prices, you know, all the classic competitive dynamics. So we're pretty excited about this next phase, which is competitive excellence. And, you know, it's straight ahead execution. You know, if we can just be better than everybody else and we're pretty driven at that.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay. So to close out, I'm not going to ask you about 4Q content, but I'd like to ask each of you the single most important thing for you and your teams to accomplish in your respective roles over the next 12 to 24 months. And I'll leave it to you guys to for whatever order you'd like.

A - Reed Hastings{BIO 1971023 <GO>}
I'll go first. I mean, for me, it's the overall direction of what we're doing and that there's kind of clear context for everyone that if we execute down this particular path well then we're going to win. So that's a very exciting and we're on target for that.

A - Ted Sarandos{BIO 4812832 <GO>}
And Doug we have to continue to deliver enormous quality at scale. The volume of releasing that we're doing, it's not that we're putting out so much just dumping the content into the world. We're actually we're trying to super serve hundreds of millions of people with individual taste and individual relationships with content. And to do that at scale, something that's never been done before. And we continue to kind of sharpen the tools to deliver on that every not just for the next 12 to 24 months, but for the foreseeable future. And but I think this time right now is just as important as it ever has been.

A - Spencer Wang{BIO 3251222 <GO>}
Doug for me, I'll have two suggestions. So one is, as you've heard us say, we want to build a really big, but also very profitable business. So in our role in corporate strategy and planning, you know, we want to help the company build and refine the muscle around big profits over time. And then secondly, you know, we've been doing more M&A over the last year or so. So again, just getting better and better at that in terms of integration and making sure those deals live up to the expectation.

A - Spence Neumann
And I can just add to Spencer's point. It's, you know, we're really in kind of that support role in finance and operations across the company. So helping to really scale and mature that combination of creative excellence and operational excellence in our support roles and support our ability to become truly an increasingly global company around the world with increasing kind of financial discipline to get more and more of that dollar spend onto the screen for the enjoyment of our members.

A - Greg Peters{BIO 17539678 <GO>}
And Doug I'll cheat and give you two. I mean, tactically, we are sprinting net ads and it's been super fun to see teams engaged and doing incredible work to make that happen in such a short time. But behind the scenes, we're doing amazing stuff. On improving the -- what we call the choosing experience, which is the content discovery and recommendations and all the things that essentially, I think takes all the work that Ted's teams do and tries to magnify the value of that for the users we have around the world. And sometimes those things are subtle because they sort of happened behind the covers, if you will. But, you know, every quarter that we see improvements there, I know we're doing a good job for our members around the world.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay, great.

A - Ted Sarandos{BIO 4812832 <GO>}
Thanks, Doug, and since you didn't ask, I'm going to take another couple of seconds to tell you about Q4 anyway.

Q - Doug Anmuth
Okay. Go for it.

A - Ted Sarandos{BIO 4812832 <GO>}
The Watcher is already turning out to be an enormous wave returning season of The Crown, Emily in Paris, Manifest, Dead to Me, Firefly Lane, Ginny and Georgia, an Origin story from the World of Witcher. We have an incredible new action series starring Noah Centineo called The Recruit. We have Tim Burton's television directorial debut with Wednesday. We have a new series from Guillermo del Toro called Cabinet of Curiosities. And from around the world are some of our most successful shows like Alice in Borderland and Barbarians and Halita are back for new seasons do all just in Q4. So let me say first and foremost, we have a lot of work to do to continue to reaccelerate revenue. We're really happy with our levels of engagement. The number of hit series and films that we're able to put to our members at prices that they think are a phenomenal value. In these strange economic times, and we're growing even in those strange economic times and with the extraordinary levels of competition out there for streaming dollars and for hours of viewing. We stood up an ad product in six months with this -- and with the tremendous demand on that product and with the great partnership with Microsoft and with Greg Peters and this phenomenal team that runs that effort. Our basic with ads tier is going to help us open up Netflix to a whole new audience of folks who are attracted to all that great content at an even lower price point. In Q4, we look forward to bringing this incredible slate to everybody. And as we continue to grow in this world of film and television and games, which we believe that the future of television of films and games is streaming and we're working hard to continue to grow our lead in this area while we continue to bring healthy returns. We can only do that by bringing the shows, the films and games that people love. So where do you see Glass, Onion and Knives Out Mystery and what do you see? The new season of the Crown. And you'll know just what I'm talking about. Thanks, Doug.
