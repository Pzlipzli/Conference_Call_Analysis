With that, let me hand it over to the Dara.

Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Thanks, Balaji. We delivered a very strong quarter across the Board with record results on the top and bottom line. After two years of persistent and sometimes unpredictable impact across our business, our Q1 results resoundingly affirm that we are on strong path emerging out of the pandemic. Our focus on profitable growth, product innovation, and operational excellence over the last two years that set us apart from the pack.

Our mobility team is demonstrating phenomenal execution, growing both demand and supply faster than competitors and rapidly innovating to roll out new creative offerings all while delivering record margins despite the macro turbulence that we all see. Delivery is continuing to surprise us positively, as demand has remained resilient in a reopening world, and we expect top line growth and profitability to expand through 2022. Finally, freight reached it's first profitable quarter as well.

We're keenly aware that the market is placing a high value on companies generating and expanding profits as interest rates rise. We're leading the industry in this respect. Our focus over the past two years on profitable growth has resulted in the strong top and bottom lines that we delivered in Q1.

We're confident that our leadership position, our global scale, and our innovation and platform advantages will allow us to deliver significant profitability and durable growth as investors rightly expect from globally scaled technology platforms.

We're committed to taking all necessary actions to continue to deliver industry-leading margins and free cash flow generation along with a disciplined capital allocation strategy. We've never been more optimistic about our prospect, we're more determined to execute as a team to bring that optimism to fruition.

With that, let's go to questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question today comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.

Q - Brian Nowak{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I've two. The first one sort of on users and on drivers. Just wondering Dara, in the past, you've shared stats about some of your cross platform adoption, your 70% of users in the past et cetera. Any updates on what you're seeing on cross-platform adoption for your users and drivers, and just some of the benefits of your multi product offering integration you're seeing from that is the first one. And the second one just a comment about the expected acceleration and delivery in the back half anything you call out there on what you're seeing on user growth cohort or anything sort of gives you confidence in the ability to continue to accelerate the delivery business through a potentially weaker consumer. Thanks.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah, definitely as far as our cross-platform usage, it remains strong and consistent really with what we went through with you in Investor Day. And one of the interesting factors that we're seeing is that as mobility is opening up, mobility -- a significant number of new riders are coming onto those onto the platform and that gives us the opportunity to then up sell those new mobility riders, to eats, to our grocery offerings. And then ultimately to our Uber One membership plan, which is the only membership plan globally that offers both mobility and delivery offerings as well.

So, what we're seeing is really kind of a swelling of new audience coming in, that then we can essentially upsell our cross-platform products, and then ultimately membership as well. So, we're super optimistic about all of the platform investments that we're making and the potential there.

We've already launched all these Uber One in the U.S., we announced launches in Mexico and Germany. We got a number of other launches, teed up for the balance of the year. And I will remind everyone, that members spend 2.7x more than non-members. So, as we move over as new customers come in, we cross sell them into the platform, we cross sell them into membership, we can increase the spend and the lock-in, that our platform provides in a way that no other monoline player can. And it's, we already have a formula down, and it's about rolling out Uber One globally and then applying the same formula over and over again.

Then on the cross platform side, the side that's invisible to actually most investors is on the earner side. And we talked about how our efforts to sign-up earners now are truly cross-platform we bring you in, not to drive or to deliver but we bring you in to earn on the Uber platform. The success there has been very, very significant. You heard I think last night, one of our competitors in the U.S. having challenges or at least looking to lean into driver supply. Our active drivers in the U.S. and Canada are up 70% on a year-on-year basis.

In April, new drivers were up 121% year-on-year in April and it's because we're bringing -- we're bringing new drivers on, not as Uber rides not as Uber Eats, but as Uber as a platform and to earn in any way shape or form that they can on the platform.

And that's proving to be a structural advantage from what we can see versus the competition both locally, and then we think ultimately globally.

Q - Brian Nowak{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
And then question on back half for delivery.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah, of course back half the delivery goes, it really is about the European re-openings and comps. So some of the countries France, for example is reopening, it is spectacular news for mobility business. It makes the delivery comps a little bit tougher.

So I think you'll see Q2 growth rates similar to Q1. And then we expect Q3 and Q4 to accelerate and I think you've also seen for us as a team we've delivered on what we say we're going to do. So we're pretty confident of acceleration in the second half. The other factor that's going to affect the second half is that we do verticals. Actually, very recently along with the Albertsons deal we are now launching the native stack of Cornershop, essentially grocery, on the Uber Eats platform. It's very, very early, but we see substantial improvements in customer experience. And we see substantial improvements in terms of conversion on the Uber Eats native stack. So, we think that the U.S. growth rate that is already pretty high is going to significantly accelerate in the second half of the year, which again gives us confidence as the delivery growth rates in the second half of the year.

Q - Brian Nowak{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Dara.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Good. Next question.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.

Q - Douglas Anmuth{BIO 5591566 <GO>}
Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask two on mobility products are just, if you can talk a little bit about the efforts so far with upfront fare and destination in flow, and some of the key benefits, and the rollout timing there. And then also about, around UberX share, how that's reimagined? And the key points of differentiation. Thanks.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah, absolutely. As far as upfront destination, one of the most significant complaints that we get from our earners and our drivers is that, they don't know where the upfront destination is. And if you go back to the origins of this business, and how pricing was built, pricing originally was based on time and distance, and that comes from, let's say the taxi days. But the fact is that, based on the destination, the value of a ride, which may take the same amount of time and distance for driver maybe very different based on the destination.

So, if you're going from the airport into central San Francisco and you're going to get a ride as soon as you drop the person off, that's a pretty valuable ride. If you carry a passenger same time and distance into the outskirts of the neighborhood and then have to drive back empty for let's say, 30 or 40 minutes that's not a ride that's particularly valuable to an earner. And if you're purely basing your charges on time and distance, essentially those two rides are priced equally. We think that's a bug in our system and it certainly does not serve the best interest of the earners.

So now, with our new system, we display the full information of the ride, especially what the destination is. Our algorithms are then able to take signal let's say the trip out to the outskirts where the drivers have to come back empty. We will then price up that trip, so that the earner trip burns the fair value of that fare. And also knows exactly what they're accepting or not accepting. That also improves the consumer experience because cancellation rise, once drivers understand what the destination is go down as well. There's a huge amount of technology that has to go into developing this kind of a system because essentially a pricing systems have to get signal based on earner behavior in order to hone in the pricing, to truly price kind of that trip based on the market clearing price, that earners are willing to accept that trip with.

So there's a huge amount of ML data work that goes into that system, but we think it's fundamentally a better way and the feedback that we're getting from our driver partners has been quite positive. It's a big change I'll tell you and there's a lot of debugging going on, there's a lot of algorithmic works to make sure that the earner experience is as great as it is, but we're very, very optimistic about this fundamental change.

Last thing, I'll say about this is one of those invisible or not so invisible benefits of the platform. This is actually how delivery has been pricing their trips for some period of time. Delivery companies show up front, where you pick something up, they're show an upfront fare is exactly like introducing upfront fare to Uber riders.

And our being a multi-platform, multi-product business allows us to take learnings from one side of a business, apply it to the other and instead of kind of starting from scratch, we've already were adolescent of now using all of the knowledge from our delivery business, and passing it on to the mobility business. So, lots of advantages having a single marketplace team, a single technology team, thinking about the best of both worlds and constantly applying learnings for one through the other. And then as far as UberX goes, UberX Share, we're super excited about the business.

I think with Share we're looking to resolve a fundamental issue that the older pool model had, which is the interest of the rider and the interest of Uber were misaligned, right, which is the rider would ask for pool trip, hoping not to be batched and Uber obviously would want that trip to be matched in order to achieve economics that we expect. With UberX Share, there is an upfront discount. And when you are matched with another rider, you get higher discount on your trip. So, all the time interests are aligned in this kind of system, and we're very, very encouraged by the early signal that we're seeing and we're looking to launch UberX Share at about 50 markets in the next quarter. And we will continue to expand from there. So, both upfront there and UberX share are areas that we're quite excited about and areas where there's a lot of innovation going in for the --

Q - Douglas Anmuth{BIO 5591566 <GO>}
Thank you, Dara.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
You're welcome. Next question.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.

Q - Eric Sheridan{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can on the delivery business. You grew as you talked about earners at a very high rate, especially the U.S., can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape for earners in the delivery business and where you see yourself vis-a-vis competition from a scale standpoint, especially in the markets that you think are the most important to you, where it lines up the most with the mobility business. And then, on the expansion of categories, how important is it to get some of those categories, right as standalone apps, and standalone businesses, versus them being broadly more folded into the Uber app and getting the platform experience more right than wrong, if you look out over the next couple of years, vertical versus platform. Thanks so much.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
I think in the U.S. on the earner side and again, we don't necessarily look at earners now as couriers or drivers because increasingly, we want earners to earn, however they want to on a particular day. They may want to stay in there, a little neighborhood and that accrues more to delivering food because typically, you stay within a certain radius or they may want to make more money and right now earnings for drivers. For example, who drive more than 20 hours on our platform in the last quarter, were $39 including tips. So earnings are super, super high which is great for earners.

On the courier side I wouldn't say that there's a huge amount of competition. In that we've got plenty of couriers. And from what we can tell our competitors do as well. It's a very flexible way to earn which our earners appreciate. So, we have seen the number of active couriers globally up 34% on a year-on-year basis.

And in the U.S. and Canada up 79% year-on-year. So we're in very good shape there and actually a fair amount of the year-on-year increase in take rate, call it true take rate that you're seeing in the delivery business is because we've been able to drive cost per transaction down as a result of higher efficiency in our marketplace because we have plenty of couriers. And as we get more density in our marketplaces, essentially the distances that we have to carry food and go pick up food, et cetera, come -- reduce in our algorithms in terms of routing and batching continue to optimize and get better and better and better, that is essentially upside as it relates to net revenue. And it really doesn't cost anything, it just costs engineering time to achieve which is kind of that we have.

And then as far as the super app versus multi-app consumer experience, the way that we're doing it is on the consumer side. We're looking to get the best of both worlds. Think about it in the same way that Facebook has a family of apps, they got Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp and they're kind of loosely coupled. Same thing with Google, they got Google and Google maps and Google Mail again they're coupled. You have one identity, one payments et cetera. We're looking to achieve the same thing, multiple apps whether it's Uber, Uber Eats or Cornershop your identity is the same, Drizly, your sign up is the same, we treat you the same way, your customer experiences is consistently excellent. You'd got that Uber One membership that flows across all those apps to save you on delivery fees. And at the same time, within each app or constantly cross-promoting one platform to the other.

On rides we're cross-promoting each, we're actually super excited we're starting to cross promote rides on Eats app, we frankly weren't sure if it's going to work. We now see signal that it's working actually, we're able to resurrect riders back into the reopening through the Uber Eats app which is something that we're super excited about. So, all the apps talk to each other cross-promote each other, we use machine learning algorithms to figure out what is the best promotion to put in front of the right person at the right occasion and you can imagine lunchtime the promo may be different than drinks time for example.

On the back-end as it relates to earners, we are a single super app, and essentially you sign-up to earn on Uber and more and more we will offer you different opportunities to earn based on what we know about your profile based on time of day, based on where you are and based on what the opportunities are.

And we think that's a very, very significant structural advantage over other players in our industry none of which has a super app model.

Q - Eric Sheridan{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Thanks for all the color.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
You bet. Next question.

Operator
You're next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open.

Q - Justin Post{BIO 3469195 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. I guess just given the challenges at Lyft. I know that you talked about on driver incentives. Can you talk about the mobility supply demand dynamics and how you're going to manage -- what hopes to be a pretty robust opening over the next six months? And then, when you look at your prepared remarks, some interesting stuff on regulatory and new use cases, just want to see if you feel like you're kind of getting over the hump here on regulatory, if there's real progress there. And why you've kind of decided now to expand some use cases to car rentals and travel. Does that kind of signal that the core business is now kind of on a positive trajectory? Thank you.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah, Listen Justin, the -- our need to increase the number of drivers on the platform is nothing new nor is it a surprise. We were on this last year. If you remember Q2 of last year, we were very early, we saw a signal and we leaned in very aggressively, initially with incentives into improving our driver supply. And then we followed up the investment incentives with 100 tons of innovation in terms of product, in terms of improving the driver signup flow, in terms of welcoming drivers to the Uber family, and then giving them opportunities, delivery opportunities or rides opportunities.

We see the sooner an earner can earn on the platform, the higher our sign-up rate to that first trip. And often, we can get earners earning on the platform faster with delivery than we can with mobility because of regulations or background checks, et cetera. So we're able to engage that earner with money in their pockets really, really early. And at the same time, we've invested in experiences where instead of for example, you're having to upload your documents into our systems, we will go connect to insurance companies, DMVs et cetera.

And as we build out those APIs, essentially we upload those documents automatically versus having you do the hard work and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't and sometimes you may get the document right or wrong.

We have, we talked about the upfront destinations for earners as well. So we have pivoted the company to being earners centric, innovating for earners, thinking about the earner experience, treating earners as with respect and dignity and building for them versus building just for the company. This has been an activity that we've been off for a year. And we feel very, very well prepared for the future. We're constantly watching supply demand dynamics. We're constantly watching supply hours, earner retention is improving, engagement on the platform is improving. So, we feel as good about our driver supply in general, our earnings -- earner position as we ever have. That said, we know we have to improve -- we have to keep increasing the number of new drivers on the platform.

We're focused on resurrecting a number of drivers as well, and we're focusing on increasing engagement on the platform because earnings levels are so high. So there's a lot of work to do ahead of us. But this is a machine that's rolling like this, this the earner team at all levels of -- operational level at the technical level, at the engineering level with ML algorithm optimizing for example, driver incentives all of it is rolling and we know all that have to work well in order for us to hit are really aggressive targets in the balance of the year.

And then as far as the regulatory process and new use case is, I think the new use cases are us playing offense, we have seen the cross-platform initiatives growing from one essential service to the other from Eats to rides, from Eats to groceries et cetera. We know how to cross promote use cases, there's a huge amount of trust and frequency and comfort with our products. We have your density, we understand where you are. We have your payment details et cetera. So, are adding new use cases such as car rental or travel bookings or adding new supply areas like taxi, they're just natural growth areas for us and because we've already acquired the customer, because we already have built trust with that customer were essentially able to continue to increase engagement with our customer. The more engage our customers are the more we retain those customers and we're able to monetize those MAPCs as a result. So it's kind of a win, win, win on that front.

Q - Justin Post{BIO 3469195 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Next question.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.

Q - Mark S.F. Mahaney{BIO 3027058 <GO>}
Thanks two questions, please. There's been a lot of focus on retail marketing. So at least across the industry, so could you just give us a little bit of an update on where you are in terms of putting together advertising revenue. I know you laid out a goal at your investor day. Any update on that? And then secondly, on the MAPCs numbers, any way to think about what the, what should happen to MAPC growth going into the next quarter? I think, that was, that sequential decline, I think it was a lot of Omicron hit. So, you are back to a point where it's reasonable to expect MAPCs to grow through the balance of the year? Thank you.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah. I'll start with second one first, which is, we're absolutely seeing MAPC growth continue to accelerate post-Omicron. So, for example, while MAPC growth for the quarter was -- or MAPCs were $115 million, up 17% for the quarter. In March, they were up at $120 million, up 20% on a year-on-year basis. So, we're seeing MAPC growth accelerate. And we expect to see that acceleration build into a pro and the balance of Q2. We absolutely see the reopening as a very, very big MAPC driver, especially on the mobility side. So expect MAPC to continue to grow, and if anything to accelerate into the second quarter. As far as our advertising business goes, continued strength there. We essentially more than tripled the business on a year-on-year basis, and we are very much on track to hit the target that we laid out during Investor Day.

Q - Mark S.F. Mahaney{BIO 3027058 <GO>}

Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is now open.

Q - Lloyd Walmsley{BIO 15125459 <GO>}
Thanks. Two if I can. Just first, can you talk about the UK Mobility business and where that is on kind of path back to profitability under the worker classification and that charges you -- can the UK, do you think get back to prior levels of profitability. And where are we on that journey? And then the second one in the script you talked about now expecting to be free cash flow positive for the full year.

Any update on how you think about the potential for capital return given your cash position and kind of where the shares are trading anything you could share there would be great.

A - Nelson Chai{BIO 3480355 <GO>}
But wait, I'll do the second one first and Dara will do the UK after. So as you know we're still coming out of the pandemic. We were clear early on that we were going to focus on making sure we had ample liquidity.

I covered this on Investor Day to let you know that free cash flow largely trails EBITDA by about a $1 billion a year. And so that's why we have the confidence to make the statement that will be free cash flow positive this year. We certainly recognize given what's going on in the market right now and we encourage all to get towards being free cash flow positive. So, we think it'll be very important as we think about this cycle. As we think about capital return down to future, we certainly are going to be open to it, right. So we recognize that we're not going to get -- we don't get paid for hording capital. In the past, there may be some things we want to do and we will certainly look at capital return as one of those levers, but again I think it was important that as you think about the pragmatic walk that we've taken on capital and on liquidity importantly, and we've taken every opportunity to improve our debt in terms of the amount of both extending and reducing the debt.

And so, I think you'll expect to hear more about this as we go into next year, but I think it was important to get to this point where we could declare that we'll be free cash flow positive this year and then yeah, we understand capital return, I think -- if you think of our equity stakes while they work they were mark to market down. They are very good sources of liquidity. And although, many of those lockup restrictions expire, if you will, or come due during the course of this year. And so, depending on where markets trade as well. We'll have plenty of sources to return capital.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
And I think, as far as the UK goes. But we made tremendous progress in the UK. We moved to the worker model, we're now complying with Merchant status. And we've recently been granted a private hire vehicle, operator license for 30 months, which is terrific. Our relationship with the city is second to none. And we're committed to city coms goal of electrifying our fleet by 2025 in London. A real leader in environmental impact, and something that we're firmly behind. We absolutely believe that, it is a condition for every operator's license to move to Merchant. We have not seen some of our competitors do so but the TFL has been very, very clear. They will enforce those rules.

So we just think 11 -- it's just a matter of time and the ones that are ignoring the law are either accruing liability. They're going to pay for it sooner or later one way or the other, we can't tell you the timing but it is going to happen. As it relates to our business on the ground, our seated position is very strong. So we're very confident as it relates to our category position and our business has returned to solid profitability. Now, we see profitability in the UK healthy and improving into the balance of the year.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.

Q - Ross Sandler{BIO 15948659 <GO>}
Hey, guys, just two kind of big picture questions. First is on the delivery side. So, on convenience and grocery, I think there's a debate, whether 3P delivery or these new dark store concepts are a better business model. So, how do you view that? I know most of your businesses started in 3P, but would it make sense to build out 1P grocery or convenience eventually. And then, second question is on the taxi partnership. So, like you said, you want every taxi on the planet on Uber by 2025. Can you just talk about how those partnerships might impact the unit economics in rides. Thanks a lot.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah. Absolutely. As far as grocery goes 3P versus 1P, our goal --

(Technical Difficulty)

Okay. We'll try again. So, as far as 3P versus 1P. I think, our goal is to provide a great experience, as it relates to our eaters and our shoppers, who want their groceries and they want it fast. All of our data suggests that getting your groceries inside of an hour is a spectacular experience. I think, there was lots of debates as to, whether it's got to be 10 minutes or 15 minutes or half an hour. And if anything we see a bunch of 10 or 15 minutes, folks move to the half an hour area, which is more of where we are.

We believe we can get a spectacular experience for our grocery shoppers through partnerships with our grocery partners. This is what they do day in and day out. And for example, we have a partnership with top four, which is a huge player in France where they are adjusting their model, they are taking everything that they've learned in there grocery space years of experience and essentially they're reducing the number of goods that they have and reducing the delivery times to that 20, 30 minutes, which is a delightful experience. So, we believe that we're able to get the essentially 100% of the experiential benefits of fast grocery through partnership and avoid the kind of capital Investments that you have to make in terms of leases, opening up a bunch of stores all over cities, in addition frankly to the defocusing of the team.

What we build, we are building a software layer on top of the physical world that's what we're good at. We are good at matching demand and supply in a real-time way. We do it more broadly and with audiences that are unrivalled around the globe. And we think building a bunch of dark stores in a few cities doesn't make our network any better. And we certainly have that -- the best real-time network out there. So everything that we see right now, we're centrally partnering up on one P and all the signal that we see is positive.

We are in a very limited way, running some tests in a few countries in Taiwan and Japan. Just to make sure, we understand that counterfactual, because we want to be intellectually curious. At this point, we think the partnership way is the route to go. If we ever have to switch, we have the audience. We've got millions of members. So, we think it's much easier to go vertical if we ever need to, but right now we don't see any signal that we should be going vertical, especially as it relates to the defocusing of the team.

In terms of taxi, just this one for us is we think a no-brainer, which as we've talked at the beginning of this -- of this call and a lot of folks have called -- have talked about how bringing driver supply on in the U.S. and globally is an incredibly important initiative. We have about 4.5 million total Uber earners all around the world. There are 4 million taxis globally-- 4 million taxis versus 4.5 million total Uber earners that we have. These taxis typically are underutilized relative to our earners. We think that the technology that serves these taxis can be better and would help and partner with them as it relates to technology.

We think that the days of you're going on a street and waving your arm to hail taxis, we think those days are over. Like we think any entity that is dependent just on street hail, is like a retailer who pretends that the internet never happened.

So this is the time and we're seeing taxi partners want the benefit of a technology. They want the benefit of our demand. They understand that we're all in it together and this can be a benefit for us. It can be benefit for taxi drivers. It can be a benefit for fleet owners, et cetera. So this is a win, win, win and it's a big opportunity. 4 million taxis on a global basis and we are now kind of going country-by-country, city-by-city we're obviously excited about the announcements in New York city and San Francisco, but I want to make sure that our investors and analysts understand we've been at this for a while.

But we've been signing up taxis in Spain and Japan and in Korea and we have built out an experience set as to how you build out the taxi product and how you optimize the experience for the rider as well. This is another benefit of our being a global company. We're coming to the U.S. with the confidence and experience that we built in Spain, Japan and a bunch of other markets as it relates to taxi. So we think it's a huge opportunity and the team is incredibly excited to get going on it.

Our next question.

Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.

Q - Deepak Mathivanan{BIO 17464056 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So, first, Dara, given that you have a meaningful competitive advantage on the ride share side, with your driver supply position or is this competitors. Now, how do you think about the opportunities to gain share, I mean feels like you can manage consumer prices at better levels versus competition. Can you talk about opportunity to gain share? And then, second on Eats. One of the fears investors have on this space is that every product category that saw benefit from the pandemic is now seeing some form of accelerated reversal maybe due to churn or retention issues. Food delivery has been very resilient. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of frequency and usage underlying -- underlying the bookings growth. Thank you so much.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah, absolutely. As far as gaining share versus our competition. I'll tell you, gaining share isn't a priority for us right now. It's happening naturally in some of the re-openings, and it could be because of a mix shift. For example, travel or the travel category is growing at very, very significant rates. And we tend to skew high on the travel category or the Uber for business category. So, we are observing some share gain in the U.S.. And frankly, in most countries around the world, we're observing these kinds of share gains, and it may be that the kind of consumer, that's an Uber consumer is higher and travels a lot, travels for business, et cetera, is coming to the platform pretty quickly. And obviously, we're beneficiary of that.

Our focus is on profitable growth. And, we're -- I think we're able to retrieve profitable call it durable growth while gaining share versus our competitors because of the power of the platform. And so, it's kind of naturally happening, it's not something that we have to lean into. And we're a lot less focused on let's say, our competitors or competitors share as we are -- the opportunity to grow the business durably to add on new segments such as taxi or hailables two-wheelers, three-wheelers or lower cost product, whether it's high-capacity vehicles, et cetera.

That's really the focus and the share will take care of itself. Although it has been taken care of itself. And we're quite constructive in terms of share gains. As far as the delivery reopening impact and frequency listen that the, when you look at our delivery business, MPACs were up 4% year-on-year. basket sizes were up 3% year-on-year, frequency was up 4% year-on-year. So, all whilst the core metrics that drive the business are positive and because of our innovation, as it relates to bringing more orders onto the platform and then the density of the network driving cost per transaction down, we're able to improve the margins of the delivery business.

So, we're happy with the trends that we see and we think that our frequency is going to also be assisted by our cross-platform usage and a higher penetration of Uber One members into our gross booking space. We are the penetration of Uber One members is still low, generally for us and low compared to some of our competitors and we see higher frequency with Uber One members. So we think that's a natural tailwind that can maybe combat some of the headwinds that some folks are seeing in the reopening.

Q - Deepak Mathivanan{BIO 17464056 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you so much.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
By the way one note I didn't answer, and I want to answer all questions. I didn't answer the question on taxi margins. So, as it relates to taxi margins, first of all margins differ by geography. So for example, in the U.S., the deals that we've done with the taxi companies should be at quite attractive margins that are consistent with the rest of our business. In some markets, let's say Japan or some developing markets our taxi margins are lower. But we've consistently seen, we're able to start at lower margins and then increase margins over period of time.

So, when we think about the growth of our mobility business and the 10% incremental EBITDA margins that we're looking to deliver. Our core product, let's say Uber Eats or Reserve or Black, those will tend to deliver higher than 10% incremental margin. We'll use some of those, the incremental above 10% to invest in products, such as taxi, three-wheelers, two-wheelers, et cetera. In order to drive, what I'll call durable growth, MAPC growth, et cetera. And we're constantly balancing the two. And hopefully you've seen, as it relates to our execution over the past couple quarters and years that we have our hands on all the different levers in order to deliver very, very healthy top line growth and the kind of profitability that investors are especially looking for nowadays. All right. Next question.

Our next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Your line is now open.

Q - James Lee{BIO 15949362 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just say, a follow-up on regulatory update here. Maybe Dara, can you talk about, maybe the ongoing conversation with the New York State given your recent wins in Washington and also pretty strong ongoing support from drivers in Massachusetts did these victory kind of help you move the conversation along and also wanted to keep friction you're looking to resolve. Thanks.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Hi, James, and thanks for the question. The most important factor that it's helping these conversations move forward is that drivers want to be independent contractors drivers prize flexibility above anything that's the reason why they earn on our platform.

I think everybody knows in the U.S. if you want a job, you can have a job. If you want a full time job, it's not a problem, getting a job, but our opportunity flexible work opportunities and healthy work opportunities is unique. You can work for us, you can work for competitors, you can work when you want, you can work where you want et cetera. It's pretty powerful. And I think that -- fortunately or unfortunately, in our Zoom world, where white-collar workers now have a lot more flexibility. Maybe they also appreciate the value of flexibility in a way that they couldn't appreciate previously.

So as it relates to New York or any other state, the good news is regulators are more and more aware that of what drivers want and drivers overwhelmingly want flexibility and they want other protections and benefits whether it's minimum earnings or other benefits, which may change state to state to state. So I don't want to comment on New York. Specifically, we're having promising discussions there. But you never know when kind of the regulatory winds move one way or the other, but generally I would say that the regulatory momentum is positive. You see that in Washington, in Massachusetts we have balanced initiative out there we are very confident of our prospects in Massachusetts and essentially we like to see a negotiated settlement in these cities. Certainly we'll look to have a negotiated settlement in Massachusetts, but we're confident in -- if we have to go to the ballot and hopefully New York we'll get there, but we can't predict the time.

Our last question today comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Your line is now open.

Q - John Blackledge{BIO 7387802 <GO>}
Alright. Great. Thanks. Two questions. What were the mobility ride -- rides volumes in the first quarter versus pre-COVID levels and what are the kind of the key use cases where there is headroom to close the gap particularly as we look toward reopening in the second quarter and the back half of the year, and then just on grocery another delivery. What was that as a percent of delivery gross bookings in the first quarter and just discuss any progress that you saw in the quarter and as we round through the year. Thank you.

A - Nelson Chai{BIO 3480355 <GO>}
So our rides business has actually fully recovered versus where we were pre-pandemic levels. And in fact, even on a trip basis where more than 95% recovered globally, we still have some room in the U.S. We're still in the high 70s in terms of recovery there, but we've really seen all use cases come back, including airport travel pretty much in line with pre-pandemic levels. So we're seeing a very, very strong reopening on the mobility side.

Q - John Blackledge{BIO 7387802 <GO>}
On the delivery side?

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
As far as delivery goes, new verticals ARRs were continue to be higher than $4 billion and we're seeing very, very strong growth there. We're also integrating the new verticals experience in a native way on Uber Eats. And we're seeing really, really promising early signal there. And when you look at as of March, less than 10% of users who completed a delivery trip on Uber in the last month, ordered new verticals. So, there's huge opportunity there. That number is up. 400 basis points year-on-year, but we think that the potential essentially up selling new verticals opportunities to our Eats -- to our eaters is very, very young and is kind of upside like there.

A - Balaji Krishnamurthy{BIO 22042896 <GO>}
Thank you. All right. Great. We can wrap up there.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. And great work to the Uber team. Q1 was a super, super strong quarter. We're expecting more -- more of that in Q2. I think this is a quarter where we're starting to show separation against our competitors in terms of execution, and that execution is showing up in the financials in terms of a healthy growth profile that we expect to see for some period and also profit generation and free cash flow generation coming up this year that we're very, very excited about. So thanks everyone for joining and we'll talk to you next quarter.
