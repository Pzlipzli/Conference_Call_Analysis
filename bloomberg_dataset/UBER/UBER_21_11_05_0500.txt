Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Thanks, Balaji. Over the last few quarters, we've focused on achieving two things. First, we've worked hard to get Uber firing on all cylinders again, driving recovery for Mobility, continued growth for delivery and scaling our momentum with freight.

Second, we've been disciplined in our execution to ensure growth is sustainably profitable and that we live up to our commitment to shareholders. Our results this quarter demonstrate the incredible progress we've made against these objectives. Reaching total company adjusted EBITDA profitability is an important milestone and one that's even more impressive when you consider where we were as a company just 18 months ago. In Q3, our Mobility business delivered margins consistent with 2019 highs.

Meanwhile, our global delivery business nearly reached breakeven. In the U.S. and Canada, our multi-quarter investment cycle and strong execution buyer delivery team resulted in us, both gaining category share and improving profitability with adjusted EBITDA growing more than a $130 million quarter-on-quarter to approach breakeven.

Today's profitability milestone is an important step, but it's just the step. When it comes to delivering on our mission and building a generational company, we know that our profitability is a means not an end. We remain focused on generating positive free cash flow while also making discipline investments to appropriately fund growth initiatives that will carry us into the future. Uber is at the center of multiple massive opportunities in mobility, delivery and logistics and our platform is stronger than ever before.

I want to take a minute to update you on our driver and courier recruitment efforts before turning to demand recovery and then a bit on our long-term growth plans. When we first saw demand beginning to outstrip supply in Q2, we made a conscious decision to invest fast and to invest aggressively in attracting drivers back to Uber with a focus on the U.S. The results are clear, we've seen 10 consecutive weeks of active driver growth in the U.S. resulting in a far better broader experience. The number of number of active drivers is up more than 65% since January and more than 20% since June. As a result, the incidence of surge pricing has fallen by nearly half and wait times are now below the magic 5-minute mark on average.

We did this while meaningfully reducing incentive levels and at the same time driver earnings remain near all-time highs due to increased utilization. We've also continued to grow the number of couriers on Eats in the U.S. with active couriers up 80% since January and 25% since June. In other words, not only are we approaching our supply and demand balance from ability in the U.S. we've done so while nearly doubling our delivery courier base from its low in Q1.

All in all, our monthly active driver and courier based in the U.S. has grown by nearly 640,000 since January, against a backdrop of historic labor shortages and an abundance of choice for workers is the strong endorsement of Uber's value and the value of independent flexible work. In a world where flexibility is increasingly become non-negotiable for workers across the economy, we believe Uber will be an even more attractive option going forward.

We've now shifted to hyper targeted driver growth campaigns, geared towards particular markets, all the way down to specific neighborhoods in times a day. We're also focused on tech improvements that increase on operates, combining our onboarding process across mobility and delivery. So individuals can sign up for both simultaneously and can start delivering while they're waiting to be approved to drive. This is a unique advantage of available only to Uber, which has resulted in a 20% to 40% increase in courier and driver activation rates. We expect to roll out this feature as widely as possible on coming months.

In some non-U.S. markets like the UK in Brazil, the driver base is back to roughly the same size as it was pre-COVID, but it still hasn't kept up with very strong demand, which has grown past 2019 levels, that said workers we're comfortable that the bulk of our work spending is behind us and that by taking learnings from the U.S. and applying them abroad, we can be much more efficient and effective in our approach.

Now, a bit on demand recovery. After a period of soft demand driven by the delta variant, the Mobility recovered has reignited with mobility gross bookings expanding 18% over September, over the September and October period, while several markets around the world, including UK, Brazil, Germany, Spain, Taiwan and Hong Kong are up against 2019.

We hit another milestone last week. Our global mobility business posted its first few days of growth versus 2019. In fact, this year's Halloween weekend except 2019 demonstrating consumers excitement to get out and move again. We believe volumes would return to trend line outside of holiday periods. But the underlying trend line continues to get better and better.

Notably, airports are beginning to show meaningful activity. With U.S. airport trips up more than 20% and business airport trips growing nearly 60% over the past two months. We're innovating into this demand with a series of product updates geared towards airports, including the ability to book a car with Uber Reserve up to 30 days in advance.

With built-in flight tracking. So, your ride is ready for you whether you're early delayed or hopefully on-time. Meanwhile, we've continued to see sustained consumer engagement on delivery, lending further support to our belief that increase demand for all types of fast delivery is structural and will grow for the foreseeable future.

Over the past two months delivery gross bookings have grown 8% despite re-openings around the world. While delivery saw some summer seasonality in parts of Europe, transit stabilized and even return to modest growth in those markets. Even as cities got moving again delivery gross bookings posted yet another best week ever last week. In fact, we set a new best week ever for weekly totally company gross bookings in seven of the last eight weeks and October was our best month in our 12-year history. Thanks to the work of all of the Uber team members.

Looking ahead it's our goal to grow both our topline and our bottom line and healthy consistent and sustainable rates. That means being flawless in our execution and discipline with our capital allocation for the large opportunities in front of us, across mobility, delivery and freight. Our mobility team is raring to go.

While the team is appropriately manage cost through the crisis, our mobility team has been exceeding growth opportunities in five areas. Low cost product, category expansion, payables, enterprise and further geographic expansion. We believe that the underlying growth characteristics of on-demand mobility and our growth that's can sustain double-digit growth for multiple years, while creating more opportunities for drivers.

On low cost, we begun to test a re-imagined shared rise product with a focus on safety. Uber Reserve is a great expansion of our category from on-demand to advance booking and is now live in 68 countries and is already tracking well ahead of our expectations. We're bringing more traditional street hill modes, like taxis and motorbikes on to Uber, allowing us to expand into new geos, offer another choice to riders and generate more demand for drivers.

On Enterprise, we begun to roll out an employee shuttle product using Uber's tech that our B2B sales team can plug into our corporate discussions. It's a very cool product. It's already rolled out for Uber. And our geographic expansion continues with growth markets like Germany and Spain showing real momentum and bookings already 40% larger than they were in October 2019.

It's important to note that we've been investing in these growth opportunities for years in some cases. So we are not running here from a standing start. Our delivery business is even less penetrated and although, there will be some moderation in growth compared to the last 18 months, we expect continued strong growth in the years ahead from both our core restaurant delivery business and our emerging new verticals business.

As cities reopen, we're seeing evidence that delivery compliments dine in at third party food delivery has continued to grow even a seated dining transit fully recovered to 2019 levels. As largest food delivery platform outside of China with a leading position and 7 over top countries and second position and virtually all the rest, we believe that we are best positioned to tap into this opportunity.

Outside food delivery were increasingly tapping into consumer's growing appetite for the on-demand delivery or everything. Today, we're focused on addressing grocery convenience and alcohol through our marketplace, bolstered by the addition of corner shop, and most recently drizzly to the Uber platform.

In addition, with Uber Direct, we're working with retailers to fulfill demand from their own channels. In a white label product that uses our delivery tech. All of our consumer initiatives will be underpinned by our membership program. We built a good foundation with a Uber pass and Eats pass and recently announced a strong partner stay tuned for more news on that in the coming months.

Last week with freight, we see a massive opportunity to disrupt the freight brokerage industry with our technology which now connects more than 1 million carriers to shippers. This year we've seen a record number of newly authorized carriers entering the market, top 3X versus end of 2020 is more drivers are choosing to become owner operators, as one of the leading choices for these new carriers, freights total carrier base has grown almost 5% over last year.

We're also looking forward to closing our acquisition of Transplace in Q4, as we move towards our vision of connecting first mid and last mile logistics across the Uber platform. It was a great quarter and one that should put to rest the many questions we've gone, not only is unfairly about whether the unit economics of this business work. The answer is a resounding yes.

But as I said to the team, now the real work begins, looking ahead as we've done in the past, we'll continue to make investments, that will investments that will set us up to succeed in the next frontiers of opportunity and deliver exceptional value to all of our stakeholders. Now, over to Nelson.

Nelson Chai{BIO 3480355 <GO>}
Thanks Dara. We've consistently noted throughout the year that H1 would be a period investing for recovery and growth. After which, we would demonstrate strong operating leverage in H2. In Q3, we delivered on our commitment to turn adjusted EBITDA profitable for the end of 2021. Our Mobility business return to healthy adjusted EBITDA margins, despite the significant ongoing headwinds of the pandemic while delivery approach breakeven.

Across our markets, we continue to see very healthy profitability trends that bolster our confidence in the long term earnings potential for our business. For Mobility, 18 of our Top 20 markets were adjusted EBITDA profitable. In the U.S. and Canada, our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded to more than 6% of gross bookings. And importantly, in four our Top 10 markets we're operating above 10% EBITDA margin.

For delivery, our international and U.S. and Canada businesses were both operating near breakeven in Q3. In addition, the core Uber Eats restaurant delivery business was adjusted EBITDA profitable during the quarter. And we reinvested all of that profitability and more to build a foundation for our new verticals business. We expect to continue to reinvest the vast majority of EBITDA will reach profits into new verticals expansion in Q4 as well.

We are confident that we will see strong returns on these investments over time. It is important to emphasize the strong execution that underpins this results, as several transitory had ones continue to impact our business, including food delivery, commission caps in the U.S. and Canada. Incremental cost of worker classification in the UK and higher than normal drivers incentive spend in some markets. For context, food delivery commission caps and UK worker cost together represented a $150 million to $200 million drag to Q3 EBITDA.

Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position, we continue to maintain a strong liquidity position and ended the quarter with $6.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our equity stakes were marked a $13.1 billion. Given a significant movement of DD stock from June 30 to September 30, we mark down the value of our DD stake by $3.2 billion.

Conversely, we benefitted from the modernization of our Yandex taxi stake, and we marked the value of our stakes in Zomato, Aurora and Joby as these companies reach liquidity milestones. The net effect of these moves was a $2 billion headwind to our GAAP net income. It's the nature of holding large equity stakes on our balance sheet that our GAAP net income may continue to see swings from quarter-to-quarter.

As we have said previously, we are not a fund manager and we will monetize the stakes review as purely financial at the appropriate time. While continuing to hold more strategic stakes for the long run, we have sufficient liquidity to give us the flexibility to maintain these positions with the aim of maximizing value for Uber, and our shareholders.

I'll conclude my remarks with an update on recent business trends and Q4 outlook. After a relatively soft summer, we began to make strong progress in the fall as markets around the world began to open again. Mobility gross bookings crossed the $4 billion annual run rate in October with gross bookings up 14% month-over-month and over 85% recovered versus October of 2019. EMEA and LATAM remain near full recovery on gross bookings basis versus October 2019 while U.S., Canada and APAC posted a solid improvements through the month.

Delivery gross bookings crossed the $53 billion annual run rate in October, with gross bookings up 9% month-over-month, up 44% year-over-year and up over 220% versus October of 2019. We continue to expect moderation and deliver year-over-year growth rates from the reopening, although delivery continues to demonstrate healthy trend lines across most markets and retention for our consumer cohorts remain strong.

With that context for Q4, we expect total company gross bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion representing a year-over-year growth of 46% to 52%. And we expect total company adjusted EBITDA to be a profit between $25 million and $75 million.

Note that this guidance includes contributions from Drizly and projected contributions from Transplace, which we expect to close in Q4 and headwinds from FX and the net effect of a relatively immaterial impact to total company gross bookings and adjusted EBITDA.

With that, let's open it up for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Q - Brian Nowak{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Dara, curious to hear about what you learned about pricing elasticity on rideshares or throughout the pandemic and the recovery and pricing. And how should we think about the rides incremental margin potential as we sort of go forward and you sort of balance profitability with those five key areas of investment?

And then the second one, it sounds like there's an update to Uber pass coming, just any numbers at all you can help us serve understand where you are now within size. What type of uptick do you see in volume or frequency or stickiness, any stats on Uber pass right now? Thanks.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah, fully Brian. So I think, as far as pricing goes. Listen, this has been to some extent a giant pricing experiment that no one wanted to get into. But we're seeing the value of our products go through.

And even with prices being on average in the U.S. for example 20% up year-over-year, we're seeing that as cities reopen, people start using the product and they use of product a lot. In terms of use cases, weekend is actually now at greater than what it was pre-pandemic. And airports, obviously, because the travel there is coming back fast.

But like every single use case is coming back as expected, there are no surprises and I think it shows the pricing power of our service. And the fact that it's an everyday need and just part of both now urban and suburban life as well. We do think that based on the supply trends that we've seen and squadrons are definitely getting better, we do think that pricing will ease a bit from the up 20% in Q4, but I think that will result in even healthier trip volume as well.

A - Nelson Chai{BIO 3480355 <GO>}
And Brian, the only thing I want to jump in there is that as you know because we get a commission on that as pricing increases, it's been beneficial, but I think Dara is right, over time the long-term things is making sure we have health in our marketplace.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah, and I think as far as Uber pass goes, I don't want to take the thunder away from the team who's done a bunch of work. Membership now, we got over 6 million members globally, it accounts for more than 20% of our gross bookings, we think all of those numbers can increase pretty significantly.

We continue to see really good engagement from members on the Eats side, Eats members, their trips per month increased by over 50% members versus non-members; even basket sizes are higher, basket sizes are up versus non-members in average of 10%.

When you look at, kind of the potential of membership because we are launching it in a ton of markets all over, I would point to one market, Taiwan, where members account for greater than 50% of gross bookings. So we absolutely believe we can get there. And members now in Taiwan, are eating with us 15x per month, which is 3x non-members. So that's the kind of engagement that you can start getting with a service that becomes an everyday part of your use case.

And I think we're just scratching the surface here, we're very, very early in our development here. And remember that we have the best membership content so to speak than anyone has because our membership will offer not only food, not only grocery and alcohol, but is also going to offer mobility as well. It's a structural advantage of others, just don't have access to and I think one that we're going to press.

Q - Brian Nowak{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Great, thanks Dara, thanks Nelson.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
You're welcome. Next question.

Operator
Next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Q - Eric Sheridan{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe following up on the point you made answering on Brian's question. Can we just get a better sense of what you're seeing early days in terms of the opportunity set versus the addressable market in non-food delivery in the U.S. and how we should be thinking about the sizing and cadence of those investments going forward when you measure them against the opportunity? Thanks so much.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah, absolutely. So I think as far as non-food goes, grocery is a -- online grocery delivery clearly has been a very, very growth area in the industry. And certainly, with a pandemic took a very, very big jump, but when you look at online grocery penetration, it's still less than a 5% of the overall grocery market versus food which often is more than 10% penetrated.

So the penetration of grocery is very, very low as it relates to food. I'd say our opportunity is actually we have a big incumbent in the U.S. is a tough competitor and we are adding content in the U.S. at a really strong pace in terms of partnerships. But outside of the U.S., there certainly is an incumbent out there. We think that we have a very, very good chance of being the non-food leader outside of the U.S.

And in the U.S. because of the power of the platform, we can over a long period of time, flip over especially our members from delivering from eating with us, from moving with us, and then getting groceries delivered with us as well. So we think it's a huge opportunity. The grocery markets is, these are multi-billion/trillion-dollar TAMs, and because of our brand, because of our ubiquitous present around the globe and our membership product, we think we can penetrate into this opportunity with much, much less capital than anyone else. Next question.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Hi Ross.

Q - Ross Sandler{BIO 15948659 <GO>}
Hey guys. The Halloween comments pretty interesting. That's historically one of the biggest if not the biggest ride hail days of the year or weekend. So, I guess, where do we stand on rides MAPCs versus 2019 and is it just that frequency lower for some of these work and commute day parts, could you talk about how far off those day parts or those trips are those categories from 2019 peak levels?

And then second question is, if we step back and kind of look at the original bowl case for ride hail. It was that, prices would come down to low enough level where our consumers would start to shift troops over to ride-hailing in a way from public transportation or car ownership. And right now, with these prices is pretty hard to see that playing out. So how do we get back to that? And if we do see much lower prices a few years out, how confident are you that you can maintain the strong level unit economics you're seeing right now? Thanks a lot.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah, absolutely. So I think generally MAPCs now in the U.S. are up about 60%, over 60% on a year-on-year basis. So MAPCs are definitely coming back, frequencies coming back and volume is coming back year-on-year. You are correct that if you look at our trends versus call a pre-pandemic GBs are recovered at a higher level than trips. And I'd say that the MAPC trends mirror more trip trends than our GB trends.

I think in terms of kind of pricing and the shift over from other forms of transportation. One point I would make is that, we have come back from the pandemic faster than almost any other mode of transportation. Despite higher pricing which goes to the earlier comment I made about the utility of our products and the pricing power that we've had.

Now, we don't necessarily want that to be a permanent fixture. But I do think with the increased cost of labor and frankly inflation in the increased cost of everything. I do think that prices are going to be up on a year-on-year basis. And as a marketplace, we get to take of that, so our unit economics, you could argue, will be improved. We are then actively investing in other products that are structurally lower cost.

So we will, we are launching an Uber shared pool product. We have been investing for years in a high-capacity product, which is looking more and more attractive as it relates on a unit economic basis, where that can bring the price significantly lower. We think that's a product that we can sell to enterprise, which is pretty cool as well.

And then on a global basis, we're making investments in two-wheelers and three-wheelers, for example. So, for example, in Brazil, two-wheelers are just a home run hit because again, they provide an alternative at a lower cost. It's a great opportunity for drivers and they don't have to buy a car; they have to have a motorbike.

So I think that push to lower cost is going to be more of a structural product push, including, for example, our offering transit on our app and I think as it relates to pricing inflation is hitting in every single product and transportation is one of those products.

A - Nelson Chai{BIO 3480355 <GO>}
The only thing I want to add is because you did ask about the times a day. So on a global basis, I think you heard in our comments that we're about 85% recovered in October. And so we're during the workday which is defined as you can figure out we're over 95% recovered. On commute, we're over 90% recovered and we really haven't seen come back still is airports continue to lag at about 67% recovered. So we are seeing the recovery, but there are certain times a day and what we call party and fun times as well is under 80% recovered as well.

Q - Ross Sandler{BIO 15948659 <GO>}
Thank you.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
You're welcome. Next question.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open.

Q - Justin Post{BIO 3469195 <GO>}
Hey, thanks for taking our question. This is Mike on for Justin. We wanted to ask about the category share trends that you're seeing in delivery, especially in the U.S. maybe in October and your willingness to potentially invest in gaining category share? And then quick second question, we wanted to ask about the advertising business and the impact that that's had on the delivery take rate, I think you call about 400 basis point benefit in certain delivery markets for the take rate. So I was wondering does that include advertising or could you dig into that metric a little bit? Thank you.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yes, I'll talk category trends and then and then Nelson can talk about ads. Listen, as far as category trends go. We're much more focused internally on building our business in the U.S. So I think it's a great output that we're able to improve profitability significantly in the U.S. and globally and we gained CPE in the U.S. It's a terrific app, like we're seeing great signal in New York for example, where we're actually calling in from.

And I'd say the Q4 opportunity for us is now that we have much, much better supply both on mobility and delivery as it relates to drivers and couriers. I think on the delivery side, we may lean in a little bit to build up a bit of demand in Q4. So that's contemplated and the guidance that we gave already will be opportunistic. But this is a big category, they're going to be multiple winners and we're happy about our share progress. It's pretty constructive and hopefully we will continue into Q4, but it's about building a big business. It's not about stealing share from another player.

A - Nelson Chai{BIO 3480355 <GO>}
Yeah, in terms of ads in Q2 we talked about the fact that our original goal was to exit this year at about a $100 million growth rate, and be it '22 at $300 million. And so what I would say is our run rate in Q3 is well over that. So, what I would -- so we're very, very confident that we'll exceed both of those targets. The business continues to grow.

I think your specific comment that had to do with take rates and so the only other thing it's actually in our release and it just talks about a change in some fees that now come out become part of cost of revenue versus below the line. And so that does have some impact and it is actually spelled out in our release.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
I think just the other really cool thing about our ad platform is that we're also building an ad product in our mobility app. So obviously it's a very, very big audience as you know our Mobility MAPCs are actually bigger than our delivery MAPCs, and it's really a differentiated offering that we can offer to our partners who as you know obviously they're very happy about home delivery food.

But they want people coming to their restaurants, they want people coming to their stores. And we have an audience that, that is a premium audience and can be a quite a targeted audience that we can offer to these advertisers and a very differentiated product from any other player out there.

All right. Next question.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Hey Mark.

Q - Mark Mahaney{BIO 3027058 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks, two things. One, comment on the synergies between the two business delivery and mobility, both on the driver side and on the consumer side, any update there?

And then just on the driver incentives, I think that peak quarter was Q2, just talk about where and maybe you mentioned this earlier, but just an update on where those driver incentives? What happened to them Q2 to Q3? And is the outlook that you're at a point now where those will steadily continue to decline under most market circumstances? Thanks a lot.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
So let me take the second one, the second question first, right? And so this is really about take rate. And so as you think about it ink in the U.S. we did lean in which was which is actually very evident in Q2. What we're going to do you'll see in Q4 is that you should actually see two great improvement the U.S., because we are going to be able to continue the taper in terms of some driver incentives.

That being said Mark in outside the U.S. and the Mobility side international take rates are seasonally lower in Q4 due to weather. And we actually are leaning in a little bit more in driver supply, particularly as some places like India and Australia recover. And I think the net of all that will be a mix shift. And so you might see some degradation at the total company level on the topline. But again it like the you in the U.S. you will see improvement in terms of our U.S. take rates?

A - Nelson Chai{BIO 3480355 <GO>}
Yes, Mark in terms of synergy it's obviously we have user side synergy and call it earner side energy and the synergy it continues to improve it's not a one-time thing, like, we're constantly optimizing. So about 50% of for example U.S. and UK gross bookings come from cross platform users, that number is closer to 45% globally and generally increasing.

In the U.S. now, Mobility continues to be a very significant customer acquisition tool for Eats. So now quarter of U.S. first time eaters are coming from our rides business, which is pretty extraordinary, for perspective that's more new users than we users then we get from Google, Apple, Facebook, Instagram; from all of these paid entities combined. So it's free. We have tested that because its consumers actually like this super app that we're building. And the numbers are significant and increasing.

And then on the other side, what's interesting is that 20% of U.S. Mobility first trips are coming from eaters. So, now that we have a very, very big delivery business, we're able to now cross-platform into, whether it's off roads or on the app or off the app; we're able to promote into our mobility business. That number for the UK, for example, is 40%, I'll repeat it, 40 % of UK first trip Mobility users actually came from Eats, were Eats users, which is pretty extraordinary.

So we just have this cross kind of polymerization of users, that's pretty extraordinary. And listen in any one year it's not going to make a giant different in the business, but it's a compounding of this advantage of essentially free traffic for both our Mobility and delivery business. That over a period of you know 5 years to 7 years becomes very significant, and it can either show up in our margin, can show up on share or can show up in the size of the business.

On the driver side one thing that's pretty cool is that about a third of our new driver signups now are driving both people and food, so to speak. And that is a higher number than our overall number. So about 25% of our drivers in the U.S. dry bulk people and food. That number was in the teens pre-pandemic. So it's going up from the teens to 25% overall, and new drivers of third of them are electing to do both.

So that again is like the iteration of a product getting better and better in terms of kind of pushing both services or offering both services both on the demand and supply side. So we're not done. I think you will see improved results compounding on top of improved results, which is definitely going to differentiate us over a period of time.

Q - Mark Mahaney{BIO 3027058 <GO>}
Thanks Dara. Thanks Nelson.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
You're welcome. Next question.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open.

Q - Brent Thill{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Hi, great, thanks so much. This is Charan Jain(ph) for Brent Thill. I had two questions. One, if you could maybe give an update on the operational integration of Drizly, Postmates, Cornershop. Just in general, the acquisitions and partnerships in the geographic availability, how far along you are in? And the second on the delivery bookings were flat to down a little bit quarter-to-quarter. I know there was some commentary in the release, but is there anything else you could share to what it might be the seasonal is it partly reopening? Thank you.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah, I think I'll start with delivery. It's a combination of seasonality and reopening. So for example in France, we did see delivery bookings coming down as summer months came and summer month people eat at more and the reopening happened. We're seeing in October, delivery bookings up month-on-month, and we think that the momentum that we're seeing in October is going to continue into Q4 as well. So it's a combination of seasonality and reopening and performance on a very, very strong track.

As far as the integration goes, every integration is different. Postmates is not fully integrated into the Uber Stack. So, on the front end, it's a product that is distinctive fun, different in terms of the brand, on the back and it's running on all of the same machinery, which has allowed us to get some great synergies and Postmates for example, for the quarter was EBITDA positive, as a result of the product synergy that we drove.

As it relates to Cornershop; Cornershop has a huge presence in Latin America. So, Cornershop is like the Instacart of LATAM. And so we're going to keep pushing in terms of innovating on the Cornershop app itself. And we are essentially continuing to read continuing to build a bunch of the grocery features on -- in the Eats app and in the delivery ecosystem and over a period of time going to bring essentially our Eats and Cornershop business together. But the Cornershop business on a standalone is a really, really great business and we want to make sure that we keep growing that business.

And then with Drizly, we're going to keep Drizly relatively standalone. I think, listen integration and innovation I think to some extent coke cut against each other. Drizly isn't a very, very, very early stages of development, there's a ton of growth ahead of Drizly coming out and as a result that team is going to be operating largely standalone, but will benefit from front-end cross-promotion, from our definitely our Eats business. Business, you see more of a presence in the Eats app as it relates to the liquor vertical.

A - Nelson Chai{BIO 3480355 <GO>}
And the only thing I would add is that, when we made the Postmates acquisition, we talked about synergies. And so we've actually realized the synergies that we mentioned at the time of the acquisition.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah, great job to the team on the integration side. You can take the next question.

Operator
And next question comes from the line of Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.

Q - Edward Yruma{BIO 4940857 <GO>}
Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. You indicated I guess some context behind the headwinds due to the CCAPs and the UK worker rules. I'm just trying to understand in the medium term, do you need to seek regulatory relief to improve those or do you think that there are pricing mechanisms or other ways for you to alleviate some of the pressure from some of these games. Thank you.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
So I think on the regulatory front, listen there's -- we're certainly not counting, as it relates to our go forward numbers in Q4 or next year on the regulatory environment changing its we're kind of predicting the environment that we operate in.

We think that from a regulatory standpoint, CCAPs are poor regulation and essentially they force us to increase costs to Eaters and they don't make sense from a regulatory standpoint that over there we think illegal and we will challenge them appropriately, but I do think that as far as our plans go we're not counting on regulatory relief there.

Q - Edward Yruma{BIO 4940857 <GO>}
Thank you.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Next question.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.

Q - Deepak Mathivanan{BIO 17464056 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking the question. the question. So the first one, I think in order that EMEA and LATAM have almost fully recovered on mobility business in October. Can you give some color on the marketplace dynamics in these regions between pricing and volumes also, I mean clearly not all the use cases in these regions have probably fully recovered but wondering where you see the incremental usage in these regions?

And then second question, can you give some additional color on what we should expect on EBITDA trends between the two businesses separately or right there need for 4Q. I know there were some seasonality in 4Q, right stay grades, but how should we think about EBITDA? Thank you.

A - Nelson Chai{BIO 3480355 <GO>}
So, I'll handle the second question first and Dara will do the other ones. So in terms of the EBITDA, as you know the Mobility business continued and had a really great quarter from a bottom-line perspective and I think you heard of my prepared remarks that in places like the U.S. and Canada, where we achieved 6% of EBITDA as a percentage of gross bookings.

And the fact that 4 of our top 10 marketplaces are actually about 10%. And so, I think what you'll see is, you'll see to continue that business continuing to improve. As I said in my remarks around delivery, we went from a significant loss in Q2 to almost close to breakeven in Q3.

And I did point out the fact that our base Uber Eats restaurant delivery business was actually profitable in Q3. And we reinvested that profitability into our new verticals which will continue. So they issued to expect that in Q4, that would be the case. And so, that's what I would tell you.

And again are -- we try to put out the bottom line guidance to help as we had a terrific October and you heard the numbers around Halloween and what's going on there. But as you also know that the pandemic has been hard to predict hard to predict the times. And so you should have seen that we're going to be a little bit prudent as we're thinking about that. So hopefully, that answers your question.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah, and as far as the difference, let's say between Europe and the LATAM markets and the U.S. if we think about Europe, first, obviously, the reopening pace very much depends on vaccinations. Whether markets are open or whether markets are not open. I say generally Europe is opened up faster than the U.S.

Another factor in Europe that's a bit different than the U.S. is that the driver supply is more inelastic in that a higher percentage of drivers in Europe tend to drive more than 30 hours say more than 40 hours. So during the pandemic, supply didn't go down as much, so that when demand came back, you already had let's say excess supply in the market to take up the slack. What we're seeing now in a lot of European markets is that demanded like higher than pre-pandemic.

And so we think that the ability for us to grow supply beyond pre-pandemic in Europe is going to take a little bit more time, because the markets tend to be a bit more regulated and the shift doesn't just doesn't happen quite as quickly. And part of Q4 is leaning a little bit into those markets. Based on the results that we've seen in the U.S. and frankly kind of the learnings in the U.S., which have been really, really significant, or really great work by the teams.

Other factor that I'll point to in Europe that different from the U.S. as far as the use cases go, not that different but airports haven't come back quite as fast in Europe as a U.S. airport trips. We don't see any reason why that will normalize, but it's just a factor in there. I think if you look at the LATAM markets super strong markets, generally with the LATAM markets the -- we haven't seen let's say the kind of close down that you see in some of the western markets.

So those markets have been the lows haven't been as low, the highs haven't been as high et cetera, they've been a bit more fluid. Generally, I'd say Mexico the reopening is a bit slower than we see in the rest of the world and we're hoping that the reopening kind of happens in a safe and healthy way. Airport trips in LATAM have been coming back at decent rates and we are seeing now demand in the LATAM markets be very, very strong. And again, we will look to grow kind of supply driver activations, et cetera in a constructive way.

Operator, we can take the final question.

Operator
Your final question comes from John Blackledge from Cowen. Your line is open.

Q - John Blackledge{BIO 7387802 <GO>}
Great. Thanks. Two questions. First is, given the improvements in driver supply in the quarter, when do you think Uber will be a kind of appropriate driver supply to meet the rising mobility demand? And what's the driver utilization gains that you kind of discussed earlier Dara? As things return to normal, would you expect to hold onto those driver, those high driver utilization levels? And then just a quick one on -- the new delivery verticals as percent of delivery GBs in 3Q and how should that mix trend over time? Thank you.

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
Yeah, sure. I think, listen on the driver supply side, I don't think we're ever going to have enough drivers. I think we're going to want to keep growing our driver supply base. I remember in Q4, my saying that are growing our driver supply base and building our relationship with drivers who use platform and making this truly great platform to earn on, flexibly earn on is it's a strategic imperative for the company.

And as we grow the use cases, the mobility use cases with the new product that I talked about with the pool product and the high-capacity vehicle product and the enterprise high-capacity vehicle products in two-wheelers and three-wheelers. We just think we're going to attract a broader segment of earners onto the platform along with delivery and we are now learning more and through experimentation, and data understanding, what the situations are where we can encourage drivers to deliver food and what are the occasions where we can have couriers move people around as well.

So I think we're going to see more earners on a platform for years and years to come and we are finally getting the right muscle in terms of promoting cross-platform usage, which is going to lead to higher utilization on our platform in terms of time of day, and in terms of driver utilization. Structurally, it'll be an advantage over the other player.

So we want to be that platform that is kind of the one-stop shop for earners that they keep coming back to for a long period of time. As far as new verticals as percentage of delivery bookings, it's in the 6% to 7% range at this point. And obviously, we want to break into double digits next year and the years beyond. We are very, very early in the growth curve, we are in investment mode, but I'd say we're in prudent investment mode.

And again, we have the advantage of having audience as our It's about cross-promoting to our audience, we got a right from rides to Eats. We're getting it right from eats to rides, and we're going to get it right in terms of east to new verticals.

Q - John Blackledge{BIO 7387802 <GO>}

A - Dara Khosrowshahi{BIO 2037795 <GO>}
I think that is it. Thank you everyone for joining us on the call. Huge thank you to team Uber in getting to EBITDA profitability and I'm addressing the team.
