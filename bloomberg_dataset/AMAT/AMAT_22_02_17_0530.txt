Michael Sullivan{BIO 16341622 <GO>}
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Applied's First Quarter of Fiscal 2022 earnings call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ.

Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-K and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.

Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. Applied will hold its next Master Class on Thursday, April 21 at 9 o'clock Pacific Time. We'll cover patterning technologies for chip making industry including 2D scaling with EUV lithography, materials enabled patterning of Gate-all-around transistors and 3D patterning control using E-beam technology and AIx. We hope you'll join our technology experts for presentations and Q&A.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.

Gary E. Dickerson{BIO 2135669 <GO>}
Thank you, Mike. This is an unprecedented period for Applied Materials and the semiconductor industry. Demand for semiconductors has never been stronger or broader and the supply chain's ability to fulfill this growing demand is constrained in the near term. While the supply environment remains challenging, we landed our first fiscal quarter of 2022 towards the high end of our guidance range and delivered our highest ever quarterly revenues.

These results are a testament to the capabilities and commitment of our global team who are executing well and focused on doing everything possible to deliver for our customers. The industry clearly has a long way to go before supply catches up with demand. Applied's orders for the quarter, where an all-time high beating our previous record by $0.5 billion. To ensure our own manufacturing capacity is not a limiting factor, we've made and continue to make strategic investments in our global infrastructure. This includes our state-of-the-art logistics service center in Austin, Texas, that we're bringing online this month. Like many in the industry, the biggest challenge we face today is the availability of certain silicon components that go into subsystems within our products.

We're working closely with our suppliers to find solutions and eliminate bottlenecks. I would like to thank them for their partnership as we collaborate in new ways to overcome near-term headwinds and build a stronger supply chain, that better supports the future needs of the industry.

In today's call, I'll talk about our demand outlook, which is very strong and strengthening. I'll provide our longer-term perspective on the secular trends reshaping the semiconductor industry and I'll give you some updates on the progress we're making against our strategic goals and how we're positioned to outperform our markets over the coming years. Later in the call Bob, will share his perspective on the state of the industry and our financial outlook.

Let me start with market demand. It's clear the wafer fab equipment spending in 2021 was limited by supply with some unmet demand pushing into 2022. If we look at our semiconductor systems revenues from the second quarter of 2021 to the end of Q1 2022 and compare to the prior 12 month period, they were up 43% year-on-year. We think this is a good approximation for industry growth in calendar 2021, which would put WFE in the mid $80 billion range.

Demand is very strong and continues to grow. We believe wafer fab equipment spending could reach $100 billion in 2022. And since we are already close to being sold out for the year. We also have a positive growth outlook for 2023. Within WFE foundry logic spending grew faster than memory in 2021 and we see it growing faster than memory again in 2022. We believe, foundry logic made up more than 60% of total WFE investments last year and will remain at these levels or increase as a percentage of the mix over the next several years. Innovation at the edge and in the cloud means that the foundry logic demand is broad-based and split relatively evenly between the most advanced nodes and ICAPS customers who serve the IoT, communications, automotive, power electronics, and sensors markets.

It's also important to put this near term demand outlook in the context of the secular trends driving longer term growth and structural changes in the industry. While digital transformation is already reshaping the global economy today, it will take decades to fully play out around the world. And at the foundation of this multi trillion dollar inflection is advanced silicon. Today 9 of the top 10, most valuable companies in the world either design or build chips.

8 of the 9 are now designing their own customized silicon in house and the other one manufacturers a large percentage of the world's chips by value. I think this is a great example of the fundamental role silicon plays in driving the system, level, power, performance, and cost improvements that will unlock the full potential of digital transformation in the Metaverse.

Back in 2018 we introduced our framework for describing the semiconductor industry's future technology roadmap, we called this, the new PPACt playbook and said it had five key elements new chip architectures, like workload specific ASICs, new 3D structures, like Gate-all-around transistors, backside power distribution, next generation 3DNAND and 3DDRAM new materials in gate contact and interconnect new ways to shrink from EUV lithography to advanced patterning and advanced packaging from 2.5D silicon interposers to 3D chiplets in hybrid bonding.

As the major technology inflections that make up the PPACt playbook take shape, it's clear this future roadmap is more multifaceted and complex than anything the industry has done before. This increase in complexity has positive implications for Applied Materials. First, we expect capital intensity to remain at the levels we have seen over recent years, and second Applied's broad capabilities are more valuable because they allow us to address higher-order problems for customers and provide them with more complete solutions.

On top of the opportunities created by the PPACt playbook, major supply chain inflections are underway that are also positive for industry economics. This starts with a shift from just in time to adjust in case philosophy. The most visible example of this is the automotive industry where the major car makers are quantifying the cost of lost business in 2021 and rapidly changing the way they work with suppliers of their most critical components. We're also working differently with our customers. They are providing us with longer-term visibility and we're collaborating more closely on capacity planning. In addition, the strategic and economic importance of semiconductors is being recognized at a national level. In the coming years government support and incentives in the U.S., Europe and Japan will translate into regionalization of supply.

As I've highlighted before, these regional supply chains will be more resilient but also less capital efficient, which is an additional tailwind for us. Overall, our outlook for the next decade is very positive. We expect semiconductor and wafer fab equipment to grow significantly faster than the economy with outsized opportunities for Applied Materials.

To be ready for this exciting future, we've aligned our organization and investments around three strategic pillars. First, to be the PPACt enablement company and provide the foundation for customer's roadmaps for power, performance, area-cost and time-to-market. Second, to shift more of our business to subscriptions. And third, to generate incremental free cash flows and profitability from our businesses in adjacent markets. Earlier I talked about key technology inflections that make up the PPACt playbook, gate-all-around, backside power distribution 3D NAND, 3D DRAM new materials in the gate contact and interconnect and advanced packaging.

All of these inflections are primarily enabled by materials engineering, Applied's core strength, and as a result, they grow our total available market. Thanks to our relentless focus on developing differentiated technology to enable these inflections, we are also in a great position to capture more of that growing TAM. For example, in the transition from FinFET to first generation gate-all-around our transistor TAM grows by more than $1 billion per 100,000 wafer starts per month. And based on our tool of record positions, we expect to capture the majority of the inflection. We will provide more details about these inflections and how we expect them to play out in our 2022 master classes.

While a current supply constraints mean, that we can't fully realize the strength in our business. We are executing very well against our product roadmap and there are clear leading indicators of our future growth potential.

I'll highlight a few recent examples. In that we've recently won multiple tool of record positions at advanced nodes and foundry logic across all three leading edge customers. This is significant because these wins are in areas we haven't served in the past and demonstrate how our next generation of edge solutions address customer's most challenging applications. In inspection and metrology where we have fewer supply chain constraints our trailing 12-month revenues were up 68% year-on-year and our E-beam revenues, nearly doubled in that period.

We expect to outperform the market again in 2022, with especially strong growth, in optical wafer inspection combined, with further, extension of our E-beam leadership. Beyond unit process excellence Applied is able to combine the industry's broadest technology portfolio in unique ways to create co optimized and fully integrated solutions. For example, co-optimization of hard mask deposition and etch is an enabling solution for high aspect ratio structures. Adoption of our co-optimized Draco solution is accelerating and on track to generate an incremental $600 million of revenue this year. And we recently secured our first wins with a new carbon hard mask deposition and etch solution at a leading memory manufacturer.

Another key component of our technology portfolio is our digital tools that accelerate R&D, technology transfer and ramp and optimize productivity in high volume manufacturing. We're engaged with a broad range of customers. In this quarter, we secured a new strategic penetration for R&D acceleration using our AIx Actionable Insight Accelerator platform at a leading customer. As part of this engagement, we will use our unique sensor technology and proprietary machine learning algorithms for rapid process window tuning and process variability reduction. We're also making progress on our multi-year journey to increase subscription revenues.

Within AGS more than 60% of our parts and service revenue is generated from subscriptions in the form of long-term service agreements. The average tenure of these agreements is now 2.3 years up from 1.9 years, 12 months ago and the renewal rate is over 90%. In addition, when we look at our combined software business in AGS and semi systems, which are also subscription-based, we expect them to generate more than $300 million of revenue this year.

Before I hand the call over to Bob, I'll quickly summarize. Applied and our global teams are executing well in a challenging and dynamic environment and our near-term focus is on doing everything we can to expedite deliveries to our customers. Demand for semiconductors and wafer fab equipment remains strong and continues to grow. There's still a long way to go before supply catches up with demand. Our outlook for 2022, and beyond is very positive as long-term secular trends drive our markets structurally higher. In addition, the major technology inflections that make up the industry's PPACt roadmap, expand Applied's addressable market opportunities in our broad and differentiated technology portfolio puts us in a great position to capture a larger portion of our served markets in years to come. With that Bob, it's over to you.

Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
Thanks Gary. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams, and our partners for doing everything they could in a challenging supply chain environment. We still have a lot of work to do to satisfy our customer's needs and this is job one for all of us. I have three main messages for you today.

One demand for Applied's products is very strong and continues to grow. Two, we remain supply chain limited and we forecast gradual improvement over the course of the year. Three, we expect to grow our revenue and earnings each quarter through the end of the calendar year. And we believe it is increasingly likely that 2023 will be another growth year.

Next, I'll summarize our Q1 results, then I'll provide details about the demand environment for Applied Materials. And finally, I'll share our guidance for fiscal Q2 and the rate of growth we expect to see throughout the year. In Q1, we delivered strong year-over-year revenue and earnings growth and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. The supply chain environment was challenging. Our teams collaborate broadly with partners upstream and downstream of Applied, to maximize the supply of components to our manufacturing sites and service locations.

This work enabled us to deliver record semiconductor systems revenue, which we grew by 29% year over year. We grew fastest in foundry logic year-over-year and we continue to expect foundry logic to outgrow WFE in 2022, with strength in both leading edge and ICAPS. From a product perspective in Q1, we generated record quarterly revenue in process control, CVD and CMP, and we achieved our highest ever DRAM revenue.

We also grew non-GAAP operating margin in semi by 280 basis points year-over-year. In AGS, we grew revenue by 14% year over year, and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 110 basis points. About three quarters of AGS's year-over-year growth was in recurring revenue. Our AGS service revenues, grew sequentially and year-over-year. We increased our tools under comprehensive service agreement by 13% year-over-year, and our subscription renewal rate was 92%. Our parts business met our expectations, but could have been even higher, AGS includes our legacy 200 millimeter equipment revenue which was below our expectations in Q1, due to supply chain constraints that prevented us from shipping to demand within the quarter.

For the fiscal year, we continue to expect AGS to grow in the low double digits with potential upside depending on the supply chain recovery. In display, we exceeded our revenue goal in Q1, and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 280 basis points year-over-year. Summarizing Applied's Q1 results on a year-over-year basis. We increased revenue by 21%, non-GAAP gross margin by 140 basis points, non-GAAP operating profit by 270 basis points, and non-GAAP EPS by 36%. In addition we generated record free cash flow and distributed over $2 billion to shareholders with $1.8 billion in repurchases and $214 million in dividends.

Next, I'll address the impact of the supply environment on our business in the near-term. Underlying demand for Applied's technology is very strong and growing and we believe that as we work through the supply chain constraints we will demonstrate the progress we're making toward our market share and gross margin targets. Although we don't usually report backlog on a quarterly basis. I'm going to give some further color on today's call to help you understand our confidence. In Q1, our semi systems backlog increased by more than $1.3 billion to a record $8 billion.

Moreover, the backlog includes a rich mix of products that are highly enabling to our customer's roadmaps. What this tells us is that in an unconstrained environment. We would have produced substantially higher revenue and demonstrated a healthy share gain in calendar 2021. Also absent the supply chain issues our gross margin in fiscal 2022 would be very close to the targets in our 2024 financial model. We are laser focused on improving the supply chain, which will enable us to support our customers and demonstrate the strength of our business. As Gary outlined, we expect the WFE market to grow by over 15% in 2022 to $100 billion or more. Even with the constraints, we expect to outgrow the market in our semi business and carry sizable backlog into 2023.

Now I'll share our guidance for Q2. We expect to increase revenue to $6.35 billion, plus or minus $300 million, which is up almost 14% year over year. We expect non-GAAP EPS in Q2 to be around $1.90, plus or minus $0.15, which is up around 17% year over year. Within this outlook, we expect semi systems revenue of around $4.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year. AGS revenue of around $1.35 billion up 12% year-over-year. And display revenue of around $380 million. Applied's non-GAAP gross margin should decline to around 47% in Q2 as we absorb near-term cost pressures primarily related to expediting shipments to our customers.

After Q2 we expect to gradually increase the gross margin by mitigating cost pressures and shipping a richer mix of high margin products. Non-GAAP OpEx should be around $1.015 billion in Q2 and our non-GAAP tax rate should be around 12%. Looking ahead, we expect, we can grow revenues by increasing mid-single digit, percentages each quarter, through the end of the calendar year, and based on customer conversations, about semiconductor demand and technology inflections we're increasingly optimistic that 2023 will be another growth year for the industry and especially for Applied. Now Mike, let's begin the Q&A.

Michael Sullivan{BIO 16341622 <GO>}
Thanks Bob. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today's call. If you have a second question, please requeue, and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator let's please begin.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.

Q - C.J. Muse
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a question on gross margins, particularly in the current challenging supply environment. You guided to 47% and expectations for that to grow through the year. Can you speak to what it will take you to build out a greater scale upstream for your key suppliers? What impact that might have on input cost for you and then your ability to pass those down to your customers? And what gives you the confidence that you can get to that 48.5% as part of the target model? And I guess, as part of that, if you can frame, what your expectations are when you might be able to hit that type of number? Thanks so much.

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
Let me take those six questions, C.J. So first, what's going on with gross margins, what (inaudible) what can we do. So what's going on gross margins? As you know in Q4 of 2021, we did 48.2%. The long-term model in 2024, I guess is 48.5% at $87 billion and 48.8% at $100 billion. We were around 47.3% this quarter, we guided around 47%, go up half a point or down. The two things that are hitting us. One is cost increases from logistics, inefficient factory operations like overhead and bird absorption. And thirdly, some material cost issues. I'd price those in at 1% to 1.5% on gross margin impact, probably about 1.2%, so middle point.

I would say that most of those are transitory factory absorption, logistics and a bunch of the material cost stuff should get better. So I'd say over two-thirds of those kind of transitory. The second one is mix. We have a couple of mix issues. We have very, very strong orders and backlog particularly in semi, so if we had a higher mix of semi versus nonsemi would help our gross margins. Secondly, if you had a better -- if you look we priced out the mix of our semi backlog so our mix in the semi backlog is very attractive.

So if you look at those two mix things and you normalize by pass backlog levels what we could ship, you pick up again another 1 to 1.5 points of gross margins. I think they had a sweet spots kind of 1.2, so if you're at 80 -- 47% next quarter, if you could get 1.2, you're pretty much on modeling, might be above it a little bit actually. So that's the scale of what we're looking at. So we're pretty confident we're on the model trajectory of 48.5% at $87 billion and 48.8$ at $100 billion WFE.

Secondly, the cost increases, can we do anything to mitigate that and pass it along. With customers, our three primary issues are: one, we have to do better on deliveries. Job one for us is to ship more tools, get them out the door on time to customers and that's our commitment to customers; secondly, for a long time we have created really valuable tools and shed that valuable with our customers and ourselves, and I think we've done a good job on both sides. Now that we have these unusual cost pressures, I think it's fair to have that discussion with customers but job one and job two is to get our product shipping in volume on time and also to create value for customers. But I think we can have that type of conversation.

A - Gary E. Dickerson{BIO 2135669 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, C.J.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.

Q - Stacy Rasgon{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Bob, I just wanted to clarify and be crystal clear. So you said you've got through the year, you could grow by increasing mid-single digits. Do I read that as the actual percentage of sequential growth as we go through the year goes up every quarter, so the sequential growth is actually accelerating itself through the year?

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
Yes. It's kind of -- it's roughly 5, 7 and then in the fiscal Q1, we think around 9, that's semi and AGS and display are similar type of that number. So the overall number is pretty close.

Q - Stacy Rasgon{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Got it. That's helpful and I guess --

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
I think that's a fair estimate. We still got to work through issues, but I think it's a good estimate.

Q - Stacy Rasgon{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Got it. And I guess along those lines, like what gives you confidence, is that just your visibility on how the supply constraints themselves are easing out? Or are you shipping, for example, like partially done tools where you just have to supply like a final module or something to make it work? Like what gives you the confidence that the supply constraints will actually ease along that trajectory?

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
Well, if you look at total ministerial receipts for us in Q1, they were up a good amount, but we didn't get exactly the match of parts. They were up kind of mid-high single digits. And if you look at that type of increase in Q2, we think that's similar, but I think we'll have a better match of the parts. Remember we said last quarter was a lot of stuff we're tracking, but the hot spot is kind of some semi device type things that are supplied through the distribution channel to our customers. So we think it's a fair estimate of what we could do. It is not internal capacity constraints. It's more some parts in the supply chain. But I think it's a reasonable estimate.

Q - Stacy Rasgon{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Got it. That's helpful. Thank you so much.

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
You're welcome.

A - Gary E. Dickerson{BIO 2135669 <GO>}
Yes., Thanks Stacy. And then those numbers are right for semi systems. We would say that AGS year-over-year. AGS tends to grow a little bit slower than semi systems. So it's probably just up low-double digits. And then display, you already have our view that it's probably up a little bit year-over-year, also depending on the supply chain. But that'll help you with the 5, 7, 9 for semi. And that gives you the shape of the rest of the revenue.

Q - Stacy Rasgon{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your question, please.

Q - John Pitzer{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for Letting me ask the questions and congratulations on the solid result. I guess, Gary and Bob, the bookings number in the backlog number in the Jan quarter were extremely impressive. But the cynic in me would argue that when your customers can't get what they want, they always order more than they need. And so, from your perspective, how do you safeguard against the fact that you and all of your peers are having supply constraints right now?

And if I'm your customer, I at the very least better get in line or I might not get what I need to kind of grow supply. How do you kind of safeguard against the dreaded double ordering?

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
Well, I'll give you my perspective and Gary talks to customers, so he will give you his. So I think one, if you look at the magnitude of the orders and how much they grow, it's pretty big number. So we're not going to be over building inventory, right? The second thing is, if you look at the mix, I think that's worth telling. So if you look at memory, so I will give you some data, John. So if you go look at the history of the industry last 15 years, 20 years, some of the leading indicators of when you over build is particularly strong memory years, three years that are strong memory years, '07, '17, and '18 we're all over 50% memory. So if you look at it right now, memory was 40% of WFE in 2021 and going down several points in '22.

So we look at memory as moderate growth and we don't see double bookings there.

Second thing is a leading indicator of whether they're overbooking in the short term. We look at wafer stocks and we look at fabulization. So I said last quarter, fabulization was at a record around fiscal Q4. In fact in Q1, fabulization slightly higher. So very high. Thirdly, if you look at wafer stocks over the last several years, wafer stocks from '16 to '21 in memory, (inaudible) with both 19%. That's not a compound rate of growth. That's a total growth from '16 to '21. If you like at 200 millimeter, it's 70%. If you look at the growth wise, it was kind of 300 millimeter stuff, 100% from '16 to '21 in logic and foundry, right? Logic foundry.

So now you go well, so John let's look at logic foundry. So if you look at TSMC has put long-term spending forecast of $100 billion kind of CapEx, $40 billion, $42 billion in CapEx next this year and we've talked closer to them. I mean, they're pretty committed to spend. If you look at Intel pretty committed to spending. And we announced new fabs. We're tracking fabs. Last quarter, we stated a number 59 shells, with $300 billion of -- $300 billion to $335 billion, that number is up to 68, $365 billion to $385 billion. So if you look at shell counts, you look at growth in starch, look at fabulzation and you look at what the foundry logic guys are committing to a little more predictable, and look at memory mix is pretty good. Then you look at ICAPS (inaudible) versus trailing edge, right.

Because ICAPS historically wasn't too big. Now ICAPS we define as 10 (inaudible) or above, right? So if you look at that, it used to be pretty moderate because the business model for customers while is to roll over tools from leading edge to the trailing edge and that was enough tools to do trailing edge. But if you look at trailing edge demand, it's through the roof. If you look at the WFE by application base from 16 -- '21 forward to '26, some of the biggest growth areas are if you look at data center the accelerator is, but it's also automobile, IOT, comms and some stuff in phones, particularly sensors. So there's big demand on this ICAP sense of stuff. So if you look at it, the demand is there. And the funding of that through tools is not there because you don't have enough rolling over from the leading edge because the demand is going up on the trailing edge, right?

So then you look at it and say, well, what is actual demand. So we said 53% in '21 and '22 for ICAPs. Well, if you drill into 20 nanometer and above. So I'll ignore 10, 14, 16. Look at some of the older stuff particularly 28. It's gone up from as a percentage of WFE from 31% in '20 to 43% in '21 and 44% in '22.

So because of two factors, demand going up and less tools to roll over to those. So somebody might say well, Gary -- that's overheated. Well, if you look at the rate of increase, it's declining right at 31, 43, 44, so it's strong, but the rate of interest is declining. So the very long answer, but I gave you data is I don't think we're over heater right now. We have lots of orders. The mix is the type of mix to talk crazy mix that you can drill into ICAPS and try a little bit, but I we we're pretty good this year probably next year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya, of Bank of America. Your question, please.

Q - Vivek Arya{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back. So in Q4, I think you mentioned you were short by about $300 million or so that you were not able to fulfill I'm wondering what that impact was in Q1 because when Bob I apply this 5% sequential growth to Q3, it only captures I think $300 million or so of sequential growth, shouldn't you be growing more than that going into Q3, given the shortfalls you had in Q4 or Q1 or is it still kind of very supply constrained number?

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
So it's completely supply constraint. We have more orders than we can ship. If you look at our backlog, build was $1.3 billion in the quarter and our backlog growth is pretty substantial next couple quarters. So we are totally supply constraint as everyone is in the industry. I think $300 million was a starting number for what it was in Q4, and I think Q1 could have been more if we weren't supply constrained. And the mix is really good for us in the backlog. Its products like MDP and like that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.

Hi, thanks for taking my question. Bob, I just wondered if you touch base again on the supply constraint. The semi industry has been constrained for a while, but you and your equipment peers have been experiencing it for a few quarters now and it seems like now you're talking not just to your suppliers, but their supplies and also a few levels below that and some of whom might end up being a direct customers as well.

So I'm kind of curious, has that level of depth in your supply chain, giving you a better insight into when these issues could abate. And is that what is informing your mid sequence -- mid-single digit sequential growth to the next few quarters if any?

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
Yes, I'll give you some more color than yes. So we buy an average tools go about 5,000 discrete parts for us. And then those parts have many subcomponents down to our level suppliers. And so some of our suppliers are on MRP, some of them are on build to stock stuff like that. So our historical visibility into their bills, the material and their supply chain was limited. We've gotten into a lot more depth to understand our suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, which goes back to our customers. It's kind of a circuitous route. And at many times they get their parts from our customers through distributors, not directly from our customers. So as we've gotten visibility into this, we have gotten a much more in-depth understanding of the choke points and ways to manage this tactically and frankly long-term strategically. So I think our visibility is a lot better. Management is obviously getting incrementally better every quarter and how we think about it strategically long-term I think is very big benefit to the company.

So yes, we got again better visibility, I think we're tactically managing better. We're not out of the woods yet, but I think there's going to be long-term benefits to the company in terms of our depth of understanding.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Q - Toshiya Hari{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question, Gary, in your prepared remarks, you talked about some wins in the etch market in areas where you historically didn't compete all that much. You talked about the vents nodes, across foundry and logic. You also talked about inspection of metrology and how you've done well there on a trailing 12-month basis and the outlook into '22. When you think about those wins and the momentum you have, how should we think about your overall WFE market share in '22? I realize in the near term, you're still supply constrained. But once supply eases, should we expect you guys to outperform the market this year and perhaps into '23?

A - Gary E. Dickerson{BIO 2135669 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks for the question, Toshiya. There's no question that the areas that you mentioned, etch, PDC are significant opportunities for us both now and going forward. I say the biggest thing for us is capturing the inflections. We talked about gate all around, wiring. We mentioned a few months ago, bringing a new tool to market, seven different technologies and an integrated platform to lower wiring resistance by 50%.

And that one platform -- combined platform is worth billions of dollars. So you've got the transistor to process the data, wiring to connect the data, all of the technologies associated with those inflections. We gave some examples around capacitor scaling and DRAM, the CMOS, logic, also inflection in memory. All of those inflections are really, really great opportunities for Applied. Really the unique thing for us, when you look at whether it's the leading logic, ICAPS, memory, packaging is another one where we have over 50% share of our served markets. We have very deep visibility into all of those inflections and it's really about creating materials to enable the electrical performance, shaping those structures, modifying the materials, analyzing to really drive the T and PPACt for our customers.

We're -- really we've never been in a better position in any of those different areas. And the specific products you mentioned in etch, certainly that's been a really great growth platform for us. The Sym3 etcher has significant technical advantages, higher conductance with a larger chamber volume unique, materials on our chamber walls, so we can provide better defects and better yield. And again, really as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, not only are we doing really well in memory there, but we're gaining significant share, double-digit share at all the leading foundry, logic customers.

PDC, that was another one that you mentioned. Really tremendous growth in PDC, 68% in terms of the overall revenue growth. Really significant position in eBeam and inspect -- or eBeam overall, the review, inspection, measurement where we doubled in 2021. We have significant leadership there. In '22, we will have significant growth not only in eBeam but even faster growth in optical way for inspection. So I would say on the unit processes, we're in a really great position and really what I'm most excited about is our ability to capture these big inflections that I talked about in the prepared remarks.

Relative to what you see in the revenue growth and Bob mentioned that earlier, you just can't see it because we can't ship it. And also what Bob talked about earlier was that our backlog, we're booking into 2023, especially in some of our leadership areas. Bob mentioned our metals for wiring and again, big inflections in wiring where Applied has tremendous leadership at the implant. That's another one that will grow significantly for us in 2022. So yes, really we've never been in a better position, Toshiya, than where we are right now. The biggest challenge for us right now is really to close that demand-supply gap.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.

Q - Harlan Sur{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I assume that the team is placing orders for both subsystems, parts and chips. Basically to the entirety of this year just given the extended lead times with your suppliers. And I assume that you guys have good visibility as to what those suppliers can ship against your orders. So, if you put all of that together, can the team need it for backlog and forecasted customer shipment requirements for this year or do you think that there's a likelihood that you exit this calendar year with your shipments below your customers' demand requirements? In other words, is the 2022 WFE of $100 billion for you and peers below what your customers require? And if so, like what do you think is the true 2022 equipment demand profile?

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
Sure. Well, you got a couple of questions in there, Harlan. Mechanically what we do, two to visibility and three, what do we think unconstrained demand is in '22. So if you think about how we do it, we send signals to the supply chain through MRP and they say they can meet or not meet. Frankly they're struggling to understand what they can meet more than a quarter or two out because it's their suppliers, right? So I think visibility is kind of gray. So we mechanically do it, but nobody sure, right?

The second thing is -- but we see improvement, right? The second thing is, what do we think unconstrained demand is, I think the tactical question you asked to could we go out of the year with demands till north of supply, yes, we could. We're into '23, so I think our backlog probably grows throughout our fiscal year. If you go look at unconstrained demand, I think WFE $100 billion is defined as what we ship for the industry, and you see our competitors are also constrained this year and they're booking into '23, I think unconstrained demand is several billion more than $100 billion. I think it's less than $110 billion, but it's more than $100 .

Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Quatrochi of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Q - Joe Quatrochi{BIO 18961101 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that you're opening a new logistics center. I was wondering if you could help us understand, does that give you added capacity or does that also help on the cost efficiency side? And then are there some startup costs that we should be thinking about that are embedded in this quarter's gross margin guidance?

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
That mostly helps efficiency of shipping, receiving, moving things around. It doesn't do much to our COGS because our volumes are up. So the COGS that we absorb into the burden and so there's a percentage of COGS, it doesn't have much impact. We probably frankly will do further expansions in the next year or two, but I don't think it hurts our COGS, helps our effectiveness and efficiency.

Q - Joe Quatrochi{BIO 18961101 <GO>}
Yes, Bob, just a follow-up. So what do you think gross margin does between Q2 and the end of the year? And is it impacted at all by that buildup?

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
I think gross wise, it is probably got about a half a point from the Q2 guide to Q4. I think what we just mentioned doesn't have really any impact.

Q - Joe Quatrochi{BIO 18961101 <GO>}
Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Tim Arcuri{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Thanks a lot. I have a question just on the shape of the year in terms of WFE and sort of how to think about. Gary, you talk about WFE intensity and the question really is how much semiconductor revenue can this WFE back stop. So if you take everyone's reporting and they've sort of commented on Q2 as well, it seems like we're doing about $45 billion here in the first half and maybe $55 billion in the back half, something like that to get you to 100 number. And I think in the past year, you talked about 14% WFE intensity, so that would have to support like $800 billion in semiconductor revenue. And this year if we're lucky, we're going to be at kind of $650 billion. So I'm just wondering if you agree with all that math and sort of how you think about maybe how far out in front of semi revenue WFE is? Thanks.

A - Gary E. Dickerson{BIO 2135669 <GO>}
Well, yes, thanks for the question, Tim. In terms of WFE or the capital intensity, the number is definitely higher than 14%. If you look at all of these big inflections that the customers are ramping, the capital intensity is probably around 18%, I would guess right now. But definitely higher than the 14% number. I'll let Bob come in, in here just a second. But just one example is in wiring resistance where that really is one of the biggest areas of focus for all of the foundry logic customers. If you look at back-end interconnect steps from 5 nanometer to 3 nanometer, there are increasing by about 2x. Now, the other thing that's happening, by the way it's also increasing in not only foundry logic but also in memory.

So that -- again that's just an example. To get that 50% reduction in wiring resistance, it is pretty complex, that complexity also impacts the output of the system. So not only are you seeing step, steps increase but you're also seeing a reduction in output and then certainly for Applied our metal deposition products where we have a very, very high share. That's an example of a really significant driver for us and one of the factors on why we're booking into 2023 for those products? Bob I don't know if you want to add any more color?

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
Sure. it's good question. I think the 14%,15% running a little higher. I think sustainably you're at a good 15, if you look at the trend lines and just put it out WFE intensity, just WFE developed customers revenues and you look at foundry logic DRAM and NAND. Foundry logic is the most and it's trending up for a couple reasons lead edge and because of there's not enough tools for the trailing edge.

So the revenue dollars, take more WFE. And you can sort of see customers talking about that too. And you see customers like TI who haven't spent in years having to add trailing capacity. So the CapEx as a percentage of WFE capacity -- of revenues trending up. If you do a rough cut and you think with this foundry, logic mix, with more ICAPS, with more greenfields and technological inflections around 3D and data all around with travel and more spending. I think 15% is kind of new normal, frankly.

If you look at electronic spending in 2025, it's about $780 billion. So you take 15% of that you're about $117 billion WFE in '25. So I think you kind of sustainable growth rate of high-single digits for WFE and it's driven partly and half of those kind of capital intensity, half is growth in wafer starts. And if you drive the capital intensive 50%, I think the numbers all kind of work to high-single digit sustainable cross cycle growth rate for WFE.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Joseph Moore{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the nature of the supply constraints a little bit. Last quarter, you talked about it being mostly programmable logic. Have the challenges broadened out from there? And I guess how is it that there's so much visibility that this is going to continue to be constrained to the end of the year, like shouldn't -- I would think you're the highest utility user of a lot of these trips, is it possible that you could get you could sort of get move up in the queue and get these products before the end of the year?

A - Gary E. Dickerson{BIO 2135669 <GO>}
Yes, thanks, Joe. I'm living this every single day relative to going deep in the supply chain with all of the components that are constraining our output. I really think the guidance we've given, Bob talked about relative to quarter to quarter improvement is really in the zip code of where we're going to land. We definitely have much, much deeper visibility even then we had, we were on this call a quarter ago.

As Bob talked about from a chip perspective, in a lot of cases, these chips are buried down in components. They come from our customers through distributors and they really don't know the end destination for those chips. As they learned that where the constraints are, they've certainly responded and helping to resolve those issues. But there are just a number of those different constraints. I wouldn't say it's only chips. They're also other areas of the industry. I mentioned again in our metal deposition products, where the really the demand has just went up so much higher than where they were. There are other components that are also constraining us, but I think that we do have much deeper visibility and what Bob said earlier I think is also true.

We will come out of this stronger. I think there's no question, we'll have better visibility. We have very, we'll have deeper relationships with our suppliers. So again, but I think from a zip code standpoint, the ballpark of what Bob talked about in terms of the incremental growth quarter on quarter is about right -- again, it may not be exactly those numbers, but that's really the relative trajectory.

Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Q - Sidney Ho{BIO 6922415 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question. My question is on the memory side of the WFE. I think you guys reiterated your view that memory WFE will grow, but less than foundry and logic. But based on some of the comments you have earlier, you're looking at kind of low teens growth rates for memory. Just curious has your view changed much given the memory market seems to have improved in the past three months or they are so supply constraint that you can't really service the upside?

And maybe just one more. I think last quarter you talk about NAND side is up, but DRAM is down. Is there any update to that as well? Thanks.

A - Gary E. Dickerson{BIO 2135669 <GO>}
Sure. Good question, Sidney. I think that there's two reference points for our view of DRAM, NAND growth, foundry, logic, and mix. And I think our view has changed a little bit since last quarter. I think last quarter our outlook for '22. We will probably a little low on our outlook for China and we're probably a little low on DRAM in particular.

So if you look at our reference point, we now believe that in a constrained environment which is kind of $100 billion number, we think that DRAM and NAND are kind of flattish from '21, maybe one maybe down tiny bit, but kind of flattish. And if you look at foundry, logic, that's the biggest growth and we think that increases from 60% to several points higher than that in terms of mix. It's a $100 billion environment. So number one, I think we're more positive on DRAM and NAND. DRAM particularly the way we're last quarter, and we are more positive on overall WFE in '22 that we were last quarter.

I think we still remain positive on foundry, but DRAM probably had the biggest Delta on our view from last quarter. And then in an unconstrained and I don't think they're growing too fast frankly. If you look at fabulazation by memory and DRAM and it's pretty darn good. So I think they're okay. And I think is a little more second half weighted.

Q - Sidney Ho{BIO 6922415 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks.

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini, of SIG your line is open.

Q - Mehdi Hosseini{BIO 4362002 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, a couple of follow-ups. Bob, you were making references, I think it was a trend, ICAPS you would highlighting 43% of the WFE mix and in '21 and 44% in '22, was that did you mean to imply that trading match or entire ICAPS as a percentage of WFE?

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
What were the two choices again, Mehdi?

Q - Mehdi Hosseini{BIO 4362002 <GO>}
You highlighted 31% mix for 2020, 47% for '21 and 44% for 2022, I'm just trying to understand what you were referring to. What are those mixes?

A - Gary E. Dickerson{BIO 2135669 <GO>}
All right. So what we did is we broke down ICAPS a little bit. We define ICAPS everything except the leading note. So that's 10 and above. Okay, but then I drove into it some more and I said, I want to look at 20 nanometer and above including 200 millimeter stuff. Because if you look at the last three years, the sales in those have grown. Now where you particularly had growth is 28 nanometer stuff. So the percentage of foundry and logic that was 20 nanometer and above in 2020 in the WFE numbers was 31% and in our revenue mix, for us foundry and logic, pretty similar too. We had 43% for 2021 and 44% for '22 and where you see the biggest growth year-on-year is 28 nanometer is up, 45 nanometer is up, the strongest, 90 nanometer, not too much.

But we went into depth by node by year. So our conclusion is that -- so the other thing that's interesting, Mehdi, was it's gone up, the rate of acceleration has diminished somewhat. And then, if you look at a curve in the out years for ICAPS, leading edge, DRAM and NAND, and their share in growing of WFE, you see ICAPS growing at absolute volume. So what also you have to think about is where did the ICAPS tools come from, not only are the number of devices coming, but where did they get the equipment for that?

So they used to take that equipment and roll it over from the leading edge. So let's make up an example. So, in the leading edge, I might run it for a couple of years two nodes, and you might roll 90% of the equipment forward to the next node and then 10% for reuse or some gets left behind. But if ICAPS trailing edge isn't growing much, you have most to your equipment for the trailing edge fully depreciated to use on the trailing edge.

But an incremental growth in ICAPS (inaudible) your ICAPS grows 2x . Our capital equipment requirements for it goes up like 10x relatively speaking because you don't have that much equipment rolling over from the leading edge. So the WFE spend on ICAPS is driven by not just growth in ICAPS but the availability of tools to roll into it that you don't have to buy new.

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
So I would say, Mehdi, just one more thing. That's a dynamic over the last few years is you used to have used tools that were available for ICAPS. That's all gone. And more of that has moved from 200 millimeter to 300 millimeter. So all of those transitions have increased capital intensity for ICAPS.

Q - Mehdi Hosseini{BIO 4362002 <GO>}
Great. If I may have just a quick follow-up and thanks so much for all the insight. It's very helpful. If I were to think about these mixes to, Bob, your reference, I think the majority of this is actually being installed in China and we're dealing with situation that for the most of the OEMs to China has become -- domestic China has become more than a third. So, I'm assuming that the investments in China for 20 nanometer and above for logic and sundry, would continue, would sustain regardless of what happens outside the china. Would that be fair?

A - Bob Halliday{BIO 3951707 <GO>}
Yes. I think that's fair. The other thing you might look at, Mehdi, which is interesting is where is the growth in WFE spend my application and you got a pretty big growth in the out years for automobiles, IOTs, some of the center stuff and phones. So I agree, the China stuff will sustain stuff, I agree that the long-term demand is pretty good. I agree that it can't keep growing forever, but I think it's already started to decelerate a little bit in the relative growth rates from '20 to '21, '21 to '22 and you have to look at that availability of tools to roll over from the leading edge when you look at WFE because it's a compounding factor.

Q - Mehdi Hosseini{BIO 4362002 <GO>}
Yes, got it. Thank you so much.

Sure, Mike. I'll give you my three-legged stool summary, as All look forward to those. Number one, demand continues to be very strong, we see our business trending up as we proceed through the year, and we believe '23 will be even stronger. Number two, Applied position is very strong. I'm confident there was really make progress with our supply chain, we will be able to demonstrate that, we are very much on track to our market share, and our gross margin targets. And number three, even in this constrained environment, we're generating record revenue and operating cash flow, which is fueling strong shareholder returns. Now. Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.
