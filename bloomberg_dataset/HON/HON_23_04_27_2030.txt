Sean Meakim{BIO 18984047 <GO>}
Thank you, Liz. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis; President and Chief Operating Officer, Vimal Kapur; and Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Anne Madden.

This webcast and the presentation materials, including non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website. From time-to-time, we post new information that may be of interest or material to our investors on this website.

Our discussion today includes four looking-statements that are based on our best view of the world and of the businesses, as we see them today and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ones described in our SEC filings.

This morning, we will review our financial results for the first quarter, share our guidance for the second quarter, and provide our update to our full-year 2023 outlook. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.

Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2.

To open today's discussion, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on what our company has accomplished over the past seven years. We've consistently outperformed against the market and our peers, doubling our share price over that timeframe. We undertook a radical transformation agenda, dramatically simplifying and digitizing our operations and supply chain, resulting in a much more contemporary company, which is a platform for growth.

We launched a software business, Honeywell Connected Enterprise, that continues to generate not only value for our customers, but accretive growth and profitability for Honeywell. We also reshaped the portfolio, spinning off three sizable businesses, while selling two others, and adding 16 successful acquisitions, reducing cyclicality and enhancing our margins.

We reconfigured our strategic business groups to better align with end market opportunities and customer needs. We built a culture of innovation that has led to significant new breakthrough technologies in ultimately meaningfully stronger organic growth.

Last, and I'm not breaking any news here, this would be my last earnings call, as the CEO of Honeywell. It's Vimal transitions into the CEO role in just over a month, and I become Executive Chairman, set great example of the emphasis Honeywell places on leadership development and succession plan.

With his decades of experience in success leading businesses across our portfolio, Vimal is absolutely the right person to take on to CEO mantle for Honeywell into the next phase of our transformation. I look forward to supporting him over the next year, providing him with additional bandwidth by helping with mergers and acquisitions activity, spending time with customers and strategic planning. Our future is bright. With that said, the present is pretty good too.

Let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss our first quarter performance. We delivered a very strong first quarter, exceeding the high end of our first quarter organic sales, segment margin and adjusted earnings per share guidance, despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges. I'm pleased with our discipline execution and differentiated technologies to enable us to over deliver on our commitments.

First quarter organic sales were up 8% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in our aerospace and PMT businesses, underpinned by a rigorous operational execution. The first quarter backlog grew to a new record of $30.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and 2% sequentially due to continued strength in Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies.

Similar to last quarter, orders remain a very positive story in Aero and PMT, up double digits organically in each, leading to 1% organic growth and 8% sequential growth overall in the first quarter, overcoming the difficult year-over-year constant HBT and SPS. We remain confident in our 2023 setup, as we capitalize on recovering end markets combined with solid operational execution.

Our segment margin expanded 90 basis points year-over-year, led by robust expansion in Safety and Productivity Solutions and Honeywell Building Technologies. Their strategic pricing actions enable us to remain ahead of the inflation curve and we benefit from our productivity actions. Excluding the net impact of the settlements as we discussed in our guide, free cash flow was $300 million in the first quarter, in line of our expectations and operationally stronger than 2022.

We deployed $1.6 billion to dividends, growth CapEx and share repurchases, including opportunistically repurchasing 3.5 million shares throughout the quarter, reducing our weighted average share count to 673 million. We also announced the acquisition of Compressor Controls Corporation this week, which Vimal will provide more detail on shortly.

Looking forward, I'm encouraged by the strength we're seeing in many areas of our portfolio. We continue to exit in our proven value creation framework, which is underpinned by our accelerator operating system. I am proud of our ability to over-deliver another quarter, amidst a challenging external environment.

Next, let's turn to Vimal to discuss some exciting recent announcements.

Vimal Kapur{BIO 7493557 <GO>}
Thank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4. In February, we announced that ExxonMobil will deploy Honeywell's carbon capture technology at its integrated complex in Baytown, Texas. The plant is expected to be the largest low-carbon hydrogen project in the world at planned startup and projected to produce around 1 billion cubic feet of low-carbon hydrogen per day. Honeywell technology will enable the facility to capture more than 98% of the associated CO2 emission, which will be sequestered and permanently stored by ExxonMobil.

In addition, Honeywell recently launched a European Clean Aviation project to develop a new generation of aerospace qualified megawatt-class fuel cells powered by hydrogen. Green hydrogen is an extremely clean power source that can be used to propel future aircraft, which makes it particularly appealing to the aerospace sector, as we work to reduce carbon emissions. The work on this project will be performed at Honeywell Technology Solutions Research and Development Center in Brno, Czech Republic, and at all other Honeywell and project partner sites across Europe.

Finally, this week we announced a $40 million plus win in our Connected Enterprise business with Globalworth, a leading real estate investor in Central and Eastern Europe. Globalworth is using Honeywell's Force for building technology to help monitor energy consumption down to a device or asset level across their commercial office buildings in Romania and Poland, while maintaining occupant comfort and productivity.

Our solution will help reduce operating costs and lower energy consumption, a key outcome for Europe's overreaching climate objectives. These existing technology provide us with new growth vector, while reinforcing Honeywell's sustainability message, demonstrating how we are helping the world solve its toughest challenge across all our end markets.

Now, let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss an exciting new acquisition we just announced this week. On Wednesday, we announced an agreement to acquire Compressor Controls Corporation, in short CCC, a leading provider of turbomachinery control and optimization solutions, including control hardware, software and services, for $670 million in all cash transaction.

CCC Technologies primarily serve the LNG, gas processing, refining and petrochemical segment, and will bolster Honeywell's high growth sustainability portfolio, with new carbon capture control solution, where the same turbomachinery is used to achieve effective removal of CO2 from the process plant emission.

This acquisition will be integrated into Honeywell's process solution business, and strengthen Honeywell's leadership in industrial control, automation and process solutions, enabling customers to accelerate their energy transition.

CCC's EBITDA margins are accretive to Honeywell, and we expect to achieve a cash basis return on investment of more than 15% by fifth year that CCC is part of Honeywell. The transaction represents 15x 2023 expected EBITDA on a tax-adjusted basis and 13x EBITDA, assuming $8 million of annualized cost synergies.

I'm excited about the new technologies and adjacencies we have unlocked through this latest transaction. We said before that we have an active M&A pipeline, and this is further evidence that we are continuously enhancing our automation portfolio by investing in new opportunities.

Now, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss the first quarter results in more detail. As Darius mentioned, we delivered a strong first quarter result despite a dynamic economic backdrop. Our operational agility enabled us to exceed our financial commitments. First quarter sales grew 8% organically with double-digit growth in PMT and Aero, where we generated continued volume improvement on a strong demand and an improving supply chain. In fact, volume grew 2% for overall Honeywell in the first quarter, despite an impact of traffic activity levels in our long cycle warehouse automation business.

Excluding SPS, volumes were up 7% for first quarter. Our backlog grew 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, and our orders grew 1% organically, and 8% sequentially driven by long cycle strength in Aero and PMT. Supply chain remains a constraint on our overall growth. However, Aero saw further output improvement, and we saw positive backlog reduction across all of our short cycle businesses.

In addition to strong organic growth, we expanded segment margins by 90 basis points year-over-year to 22%. We continue to reap benefits from our investment in Honeywell's digital that have enabled us to stay ahead of inflation curve through the strategic pricing action. Despite a top-line headwind, SPS led the other SPGs, with the largest segment margin expansion as a benefit from the right size cost base.

Now let's spend a few minutes in the first quarter performance by business. Aerospace, sales for the first quarter were up 14% organically, led by 20% growth in commercial aviation, the fifth straight quarter of at least 20% organic growth and eighth straight quarter of double-digit growth.

Sales growth was strongest in commercial aviation aftermarket. We had continued flight hour recovery result in increased spare shipments and repair and overhaul sales, particularly in air transport. Commercial original equipment sales were also increased double-digit driven by higher business and general aviation sales.

Defense and space returned to growth in the first quarter, as we were able to convert our strong 2022 orders book increase sales volume. Book-to-bill in defense and space remain greater than 1 in the quarter. As expected, the Aero supply chain continued to make modest progress sequentially. Improvements in material availability from the lower supply decommitment rates enabled us to increase our original equipments and spare shipment by 20% year-over-year in first quarter.

Our past due backlog remains at historically high level, as expected, with plenty of volume yet to be unlocked. Segment margin in aerospace contracted 80 basis points year-over-year to 26.6%, driven by higher sales of lower-margin original equipment products, partially offset by our commercial excellence effort and volume leverage.

Performance Materials and Technologies orders grew organically across all three businesses ahead of our expectation, led by over 20% growth in UOP. We remain particularly excited about traction in our sustainable technology solutions business, where orders doubled year-over-year.

For sales, PMT grew 15% organically in the quarter with double-digit growth in all three segments of the PMT portfolio. This was a fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth in PMT. UOP grew 19% organically in the quarter, led by refining catalyst shipment and gas processing, partially offset by lower refining and PetChem equipment volumes.

Process solution grew 16% organically, driven by strengths in projects and smart energy. In advanced materials, sales grew 12% in the quarter, as we saw another quarter of robust demand in fluorine products that more than offset some softness in our electronic materials business.

Segment margin contracted 20 basis point year-over-year to 20.6%, as a result of cost inflation, higher sales of lower margin products, and a previously communicated disruption in one of our PMT plant that caused some unplanned downtime, partially offset by commercial excellence and volume leverage.

Safety and Productivity Solutions sales decreased 11% organically in the quarter. Sales decline were led by warehouse and workflow solutions and productivity solutions and services. The aftermarket services portion of our integrated business continues to perform well as expected, with sales growing greater than 20% in the quarter at accretive margin. And the sensing portion of our sensing and safety technologies business remains a bright spot in the portfolio.

Continuing on the trend from last year, segment margin for SPS was once again a standout in the quarter, expanding 270 basis point to 17.2%, as a result of productivity actions and commercial excellence, partially offset by lower volume leverage and inflation.

In Building Technologies, sales increased 9% organically in the quarter, with growth in both building products and building solutions. Project sales were up double digits for the fourth consecutive quarter, as we continue to convert our strong backlog. Services volumes also increased in the quarter, resulting in 13% organic sales growth in building solutions.

Turning to our product portfolio. The supply chain is improving as expected. Building products grew 7% organically year-over-year to continued strengthen in our world-class fire franchise. HPT orders were stronger than expected in first quarter, although down mid-single digit year-over-year organically, as we lapped outside 2022 comps from the height of supply chain challenges.

While inflation remains elevated and our strong building solution sales presented a mix headwind, our commercial excellence and productivity effort allow us to mitigate these challenges and expand HPT segment margins by 170 basis points to 25.2%.

Growth across our portfolio continues to be supported by accretive results in Honeywell Connected Enterprise, and ongoing indicator of the power of strong software franchise. Robust overall growth was driven by double-digit growth in cyber, industrial, aerospace and connected building. The future outlook is also strong due to double-digit growth in orders. Overall, this was a great result for Honeywell.

Adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter grew 8% to $2.07, $0.11 above the high end of our first quarter guidance, and up 16% excluding pension headwind. Segment profit drove $0.21 of year-over-year improvement in earnings per share, the main driver of our EPS growth.

Excluding the pension headwind, below the line and other added $0.03 year-over-year. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed $0.02 of improvement and reduced share count added an additional $0.05 for total EPS, excluding the pension impact of $2.22. This was offset by $0.15 headwind from a lower pension income. A bridge from adjusted EPS from 1Q '22 to 1Q '23 can be found in the appendix of this presentation.

We made good progress on cash for Q1. Reported cash flow for the quarter was negative $1 billion due to payment of settlement signed in fourth quarter of '22, which we signaled in our guidance call. Excluding the net impact of the settlement, we generated $300 million of free cash flow up from $50 million in the first quarter of last year. This increase was driven by improved working capital, including more favorable payables and inventory balances.

As we discussed, our inventory planning focus will be a major contributor to our cash performance in 2023, and we are off to a promising start. So overall, Honeywell operating playbook continues to deliver strong results. And that combined with our differentiated portfolio of solution will enable us to drive compelling growth in earnings and cash for the quarters to come.

Now let me turn it over to Greg, as we move to Slide 7 to discuss our second quarter and full-year guidance.

Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Thanks, Vimal, and good morning, everyone. As we look to the rest of 2023, our original guidance framework continues to be solid. We delivered above our Q1 guide, as we navigated known risks and have raised the year to reflect that. Our demand profile remains robust, with record backlog and favorable order trends in Aerospace and PMT. We continue to monitor the macroeconomic backdrop and its impact on our shorter cycle businesses and our rigorous operating principles enable us to stay agile to outperform through another challenging year.

For our Q2 sales guidance, we expect to be in the range of $9.0 billion to $9.2 billion, up 1% to 4% on an organic basis. We now expect full year sales of $36.5 billion to $37.3 billion, which represents an increase of $500 million in the low end and $300 million in the high end from our prior guidance, incorporating our strong first quarter results.

We're raising our organic growth range now at 3% to 6%, and we continue to expect a greater balance of price and volume versus last year, and have upgraded our full-year expectations in Aero, while softening our outlook for SPS to reflect the demand we are seeing.

Moving to our segment margin guidance. We expect the second quarter to be in the range of 21.8% to 22.2%, resulting in year-over-year margin expansion of 90 basis points to 130 basis points due to continued benefits from our improving cost position and business mix in SPS and commercial excellence in HPT.

For full year 2023, we're upgrading our segment expectations, our segment margin expectation by 10 basis points on the low end, to a new range of 22.3% to 22.6%, or 60 basis points to 90 basis points of year-over-year expansion. Our rigorous fixed cost management and favorable price cost strategies remain key elements of our operating playbook, helping us to drive margin expansion.

Now let's take a moment to walk through the second quarter and full-year expectations by segment. Looking ahead for Aerospace, demand across our end markets remain very encouraging. We expect modest sequential sales growth in the second quarter, as flight hours continue to improve, with particular strength in commercial aftermarket. This flight hour growth enhanced by further recovery in wide-body aircraft, as international travel recovers, will lead commercial aftermarket to be our strongest end market for sales in 2023.

On the commercial OE side, we also expect strong volume growth as build rates, particularly for business in general aviation OEs, continue to trend upwards. In defense and space, we past the growth inflection point in 1Q, and we expect similar organic growth rates throughout the year, as we convert our strong defense order book into sales.

While the demand environment supports rapid top-line acceleration, the pace of sales growth throughout '23 will ultimately be determined by the rate of recovery in the Aero supply chain. Our expectation for the supply chain remains unchanged, modest steady improvement each quarter.

Reduced decommits from suppliers should allow for sequential improvements in factory output. Given the positive signs from the supply chain and continued strength in our order book, we now expect Aero organic sales growth in the low double-digit range, and upgrade from our outlook last quarter of high-single digits to low-double digit growth. However, we anticipate most of the incremental sales strength to come from our OE business, resulting in modest mix pressure on margins. We now expect Aero segment margins to be flattish for the full year.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, the constructive outlook across our end markets will continue to drive favorable growth. For the second quarter, we expect sales to increase sequentially and year-over-year, led by continued strength in our projects and smart energy businesses within process solutions as well as life cycle solutions and services. This strength will likely continue throughout the year, supporting a strong growth for process solutions overall.

In advanced materials, continued demand for fluorine products will enable us to capitalize on our capacity expansion investments we made in '22, but we still expect to see some softness in electronic materials until the second half of the year.

In UOP, our growth outlook is supported by robust demand for gas processing equipment, and we see increasing global demand for our sustainable technology solutions, as legislation has improved project economics.

For the full-year, another quarter of strong orders and backlog growth gives us confidence in our sales expectation, although more challenging comps moving forward, I mean that the first quarter will likely be the largest in terms of organic growth. We still expect sales for overall PMT to be up mid-single digits for the year. Segment margin and PMT should expand sequentially in the second quarter and throughout the second half, leading to modest expansion for the year.

Looking ahead for SPS, we're expecting low-double-digit year-over-year declines in the second quarter, as we see continued impact from the decline in investment for new warehouse capacity and short-cycle demand softness in our products businesses. However, we expect sales to grow sequentially from the first quarter, led by strength in sensing and safety technologies.

The aftermarket services portion of our Intelligrated business continues to grow at strong double-digit rates, and we anticipate this trend continuing throughout the year. In our short-cycle businesses, the demand outlook for '23 is a bit more challenged than we initially anticipated, and as a result, we now expect SPS to be down high-single digits, lower than our initial guidance last quarter of down mid-single digits to high-single digits.

However, from a margin standpoint, we still anticipate another solid year for SPS, as we see the results of our operational improvements, and as sales mix continues to improve, as evidenced in our first quarter results.

In Building Technologies, we are encouraged by our strong start to the year and the overall execution in the business. For the second quarter, sales should improve sequentially and lead to modest year-over-year growth, as the supply chain environment continues to slowly improve, allowing us to further work down the past due backlog we built last year in our building products business.

We expect this robust backlog along with stimulus-led institutional demand in verticals such as airports, healthcare and education to remain resilient throughout the year. On the building solution side, we are encouraged by the strong demand for our building services, and we see our long cycle building solution sales likely outpacing product sales in 2023.

For overall HBT, while we delivered high-single-digit growth for the first quarter, comps get harder, as we progress throughout the year, given that the impacts from our supply constraints were most acute in the first half of 2022, and we maintain our full-year sales outlook of low-single-digit organic growth. Although, as we've said previously, we'll continue to monitor orders for Q2 and may have an upgrade opportunity after we complete the second quarter.

HBT remains well aligned to emerging secular themes of sustainability and energy efficiency, and we see runway for growth acceleration, as we exit '23. For HBT segment margins, we still expect year-over-year expansion in 2023, as we maintain our momentum for the first quarter.

Turning to our other core guided metrics, net below the line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $130 million to negative $185 million in the second quarter, and negative $500 million to negative $625 million for the full year. This guidance includes a range of repositioning between $50 million and $100 million for 2Q and $225 million to $325 million for the year, as we continue to fund attractive restructuring projects and properly position Honeywell for the future.

We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be roughly 21% in the second quarter and for the year, and the average share count to be around 671 million shares in 2Q and approximately 670 million shares for the full year. Earlier this week, the Board approved a $10 billion share repurchase authorization, providing us with continued flexibility on the best way to deploy our balance sheet.

As a result of these inputs, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range is between $2.15 and $2.25 for the second quarter, up 2% to 7% year-over-year. For full-year EPS, we are upgrading the low end of our guidance range by $0.20 and the high end of our guidance range by $0.05 to a new range of $9 to $9.25, up 3% to 6%, reflecting our continued confidence that 2023 will be a strong growth year for Honeywell, despite the year-over- year pension headwind.

Excluding these headwinds, EPS growth will be 9% to 12% up for the year. We still expect to meet our original free cash flow guidance of $3.9 billion to $4.3 billion in 2023, or $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, excluding the net impact of settlements.

So, in total, we executed a strong first quarter without performance across all guided metrics and are raising our full year 2023 organic sales growth, segment margin and adjusted EPS guidance ranges.

Now let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll hand the call back to Darius for some closing thoughts before we move to Q&A.

Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Thank you, Greg. In summary, we're off to a strong start to 2023, over-delivering across the board versus our guidance, allowing us to meaningfully raise our full year guidance for organic growth, segment margin and earnings per share.

Our value creation framework is working. The macro economy remains uncertain, but we continue to grow our record backlog and executing at it provides significant runway in the near term. Honeywell remains well positioned to outperform in any environment. Thank you to all of our Honeywell colleagues to continue to drive differentiated performance for our customers and shareholders.

With that, Sean, let's move to Q&A.

Sean Meakim{BIO 18984047 <GO>}
Thank you, Darius. Darius, Greg, Vimal, and Anne are now available to answer your questions. We ask that you please be mindful of others in the queue, by only asking one question. Liz, please open the line for Q&A.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)

Our first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa at JPMorgan.

Q - Stephen Tusa
Guys, good morning.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Good morning.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Good morning.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Congrats again, Vimal, on the change.

A - Vimal Kapur{BIO 7493557 <GO>}
Thank you.

Q - Stephen Tusa
I guess your first call is going to be, I guess, the second quarter. But on that front, maybe give us some color on the sequential trends, as far as earnings are concerned for the rest of the year, 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q, just to kind of level set everybody after this pretty strong first quarter.

A - Vimal Kapur{BIO 7493557 <GO>}
So, sequentially, as Greg gave you the full-year view, we do expect the growth momentum to continue even though at a slightly different rate. Part of it is, we had a pretty strong quarters in PMT and HBT prior year. So, we are dealing with the tough comps. So, there is certainly going to be some revenue comparison issues there. Aero will be very strong and SPS, as we guided will be moderated performance over the rest of the year. But overall, we remain confident on our new guide of 3% to 6% organic growth rate. And we will work hard to perform on that.

Greg, if you want to add anything?

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
No, I think you hit it. I mean the second quarter, is going to be really nice results, I think, across the portfolio. Albeit we are just coming off of four quarters of significantly strong, double-digit growth in PMT for four straight quarters, HPT at high single digits for three to four straight quarters. But the underlying business performance going forward is going to be really healthy.

Q - Stephen Tusa
Sorry, so what's the sequential performance for EPS? Should we think about that as kind of in line with normal seasonality? Or, which usually up in the second quarter? Like, how do we think about the pacing of EPS for the rest of the year?

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Yeah, when you look at EPS sales, I mean, we're going to be roughly in line with our normal, kind of percentage of the year in those quarters. This year and last year, a little bit heavier in the back half. This year a little less so. But it's not going to look out of the norm.

Q - Stephen Tusa
What is the norm? Can you just remind us, because it's been a couple years of abnormal?

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Well, you're asking about many different mega piece. [ph] So, it depends on which one you're talking about.

Q - Stephen Tusa
Just EPS. EPS.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Yeah, we're, I mean, when you look at it right now, we're going to have a little bit of a heavier back end of the year, fourth quarter will probably be bigger than second and third. But the second and third will be within spitting distance of one another roundabout.

Q - Stephen Tusa
Okay, great. Thanks a lot for the color.

Operator
Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Q - Julian Mitchell{BIO 21229700 <GO>}
Hi, good morning.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Good morning.

Q - Julian Mitchell{BIO 21229700 <GO>}
Good morning. Just wanted to try to understand, dialing in on the second quarter for a second. So, you've got a smaller than maybe normal sequential sales increase. It doesn't sound like that's anything sort of macro or demand related, it's maybe more on supply. So, any extra color on that. And also it looks like you're guiding for sort of sales to be up sequentially in Q2 firm wide somewhat, but flat margins. So, is that just something around maybe Aero OE mix? Just any thoughts on that, please.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yes, Julian, if you actually look at the historical revenue sort of step from Q1 to Q2, it's very much in line with what we've done historically. Last year was a bit of an anomaly; given that it was more heavily impacted by some of the supply chain challenges. But if you look at the historical graduation from Q1 to Q2, it's very much consistent and in line with that, if you look at the prior year averages.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Yes. No, I mean, we've grown anywhere from 4% to 7% quarter-to-quarter sequentially. This guide has us rising like a 3% to 4% range. Last year, we had a really big step up in PMT. It's a little bit less in Q2 this year, but again, very much within historical parameters.

And from a margin perspective, again, last year we went down in margin rate from Q1 to Q2. So, our guide is solidly within our Q1 performance. I think at the top end, we're up 20 basis points. At the bottom end, we're down 20 basis points. So, it's frankly right in the norm. So, I wouldn't read too much into it.

Q - Julian Mitchell{BIO 21229700 <GO>}
Thanks very much. And then just my follow-up would be around the SPS piece, sort of update your thoughts on that second half outlook, particularly the PSS portion, kind of how are you looking at that in the second half on revenue versus warehouse? And if there's been any change in your warehouse growth, or sales assumptions for the year? Thank you.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yeah, so I mean, let's kind of take this piece by piece. I mean, in terms of PSS, I mean, we've kind of actually seen sequential improvement off of Q4. So, we think that business is back on the rise, and we saw that sequentially. So, I think that, that's very much consistent with our assumptions and very much in line with our expectations.

When it comes to IGS, that was -- that's still -- that market continues to be relatively soft. But having said that, our core activity and our opportunity activity significantly increasing for Q2, Q3, and Q4, because as we look at forward in the pipeline, that continues to get better and better. So, we're cautiously optimistic, yes, we're going to see much better order trends, as we head into the last three quarters of the year.

Yes. I think Darius put it quite well. Look, this is the IGS revenue for this year is kind of already locked, given the long nature of the business here. Really working hard to secure good base of orders for 2023, so that we can print a good year for 2024 ahead. And we remain -- one thing I can assure, we're not going to lose share. So, it's all more on the market and as market recovers, we will get our fair share of demand.

Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Q - Nigel Coe{BIO 3818998 <GO>}
Oh, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Hi, good morning.

Q - Nigel Coe{BIO 3818998 <GO>}
Hey, hi guys. Amidst, but maybe just be a little bit clearer on kind of what's surprise to the upside. And, it sounds like it's partly supply chain, but it also sounds like it's partly demand. So, maybe just talk about that. And we saw a pretty significant uptick in accounts achievable on the balance sheet, which might indicate the March was perhaps particularly strong. So, maybe just talk about that as well.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Sure. Let me take that. So, if you think about our guidance, 90 days ago, we talked about really three specific risks that we were watching. You know, one was China, with Chinese New Year and concerns about, whether everyone was going to go home and then come back and wind up with lockdowns in China. It didn't happen. Things turned out quite well. There was really no disruption in China at all.

Second one was really, again, Aerospace and, where we going to get a substantial sequential improvement in output? And we did. We were up 20% in our output in Aerospace year-over-year, which was above the high end of our guidance and was quite strong.

And then the third one was PMT. And we talked about the fact that, in December, we had some challenges with a freeze in the Louisiana area, with some of our factories there. And we had an outage early January, which we needed to shut down a plant and bring it back up again. And it came up quite well, and in fact, on time. And after the plant was restored, it was operating at levels that were greater than before, the outage even occurred. And so, that's why what you're seeing is essentially PMT and Aerospace in particular drove probably over $100 million each on the top end of our own guide in terms of the revenue outlook.

So, those are things that we were conscious of and we are watching and managing, where we could, and things turned out quite well. So, that was really good. And then again, as you mentioned, accounts receivable goes up. As you recall, 50% of our revenues in any quarter in the last month of the quarter, we had a really strong revenue performance. AR goes up and we've got a lot of receivables here to collect in April, and I'm sure that will bode well for strong cash here in Q2.

Q - Nigel Coe{BIO 3818998 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Greg. I'll leave it there. One question.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}

Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.

Q - Scott Davis{BIO 2393277 <GO>}
Hey, good morning, guys.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Good morning.

A - Vimal Kapur{BIO 7493557 <GO>}
Good morning, Melius.

Q - Scott Davis{BIO 2393277 <GO>}
Welcome, Vimal.

A - Vimal Kapur{BIO 7493557 <GO>}
Yes.

Q - Scott Davis{BIO 2393277 <GO>}
Guys, you announced this buyback is pretty darn large, $10 billion is a big number. And we're hearing chatter from, I don't know other companies here and there that M&A is just starting to get into a little bit of a sweet spot, where valuations are starting to make a little bit more sense and PE is less competitive, of course.

How do you guys think about your pipeline of deals that's out there and the optionality and versus kind of the guide, I think, the share countdown, kind of 1% ballpark, means you may not be going in and hitting the bid on that $10 billion right away. But how do you think about the ebb and flow of the buyback versus that M&A? And perhaps the big question there is, what's your backlog in pipeline look like? And I'll stop there. Thanks.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Hey, Scott, real quick, just what you saw with the $10 billion authorization, that is like what we always do. We work our authorization down to about a $2 billion range. And then we, frankly, almost as a matter of course, re-up it to $8 billion or $10 billion. And so you should view that as us just doing our normal restacking of our buyback authorization to give us the flexibility that we always have. So, there was nothing abnormal in that at all in terms of the cycle of the way we operate.

But I'm sure Darius will talk about the capital allocation aspect.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, in terms of our framework, you've got to remember, we are holding to the framework of 1%, I mean buyback per year on average. And we've done that. We've stuck to that. And I think that's very, that $10 billion authorization continues to underpin that kind of an algorithm. So, I think, I wouldn't look too much or too little into it. It's just supportive of that. And, we're going to continue to buy back shares, as we see the -- they're priced aggressively and we'll do at least 1%.

The M&A, which I think is the more important question, is I think, I've always said, there's time to be a buyer and there's a time to be a seller. I have not seen a better time, at least since I've been CEO, to be a buyer. I know you saw one deal we did this past week. I think that it's an opportunity for us to be much more active. The pipeline is probably better than it's ever been. I think we've got some interesting bolt-ons that we're looking at that hopefully we're going to be able to close here in the next few months.

Q - Scott Davis{BIO 2393277 <GO>}
Darius, just natural follow-up. It's a quite a statement, never seen a better time to be a buyer. I don't think I've ever heard you say anything in that context to that bullish in your tenure. And then would you consider going up in size? You just said bolt-ons, but perhaps something a little bit more larger in the pipe?

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Well, I mean, I think, we said the bolt-on for us is up to $5 billion, $6 billion, $7 billion range. So, I'd say that, that's decent in size. You know, the reason I'm more bullish is, look, the cost of money has gone up significant. I mean, you see the interest rates, and frankly, the competition is different.

The competition for assets now is primarily strategic. A lot of the PE activity is not, I wouldn't say it's not existent, but it's not nearly as strong as it used to be. And, I think, it's smart to be a buyer or a seller in various cycles of economic conditions and interest rates. And I think right now, I think, it's smart to be a little bit more aggressive on being a buyer.

Q - Scott Davis{BIO 2393277 <GO>}
Yes, very encouraging. Thank you. I'll pass it on, guys. Good luck.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}

Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.

Q - Sheila Kahyaoglu{BIO 17240338 <GO>}
Thank you, and good morning everyone. Maybe bigger picture as well, can you talk about, what you guys are seeing, Darius, across the pricing portfolio? I think, Greg, you mentioned pricing contributed 6 points, the organic growth of 8, including SPS. How does pricing balance out and volume throughout the remainder of the year? And how do you see it playing across the segments?

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, I think, you saw kind of a fix to mix as we move forward. I think, frankly, we're still projecting to be about a 4% price impact for the year. So, obviously, pricing is going to become a bit tougher in the second half of the year, as we kind of lap some of those comps. But overall, pricing is going to continue to be a significant value driver for our results, given the differentiation and the technologies that we have in our portfolio.

So, that's kind of how we see the setup, obviously, coming off a 6% and projecting for the year, we expect something a bit lower in the second half. But that's all very much within the algorithm that we expected for the year. And actually gain confidence in that algorithm, given our raise both in the bottom and top end of our ranges.

I don't know, Greg, if you want to.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Yeah. No, I think you said it. This is not really that different from what we talked about and we have positive price every quarter of this year. So, no concerns in that. Again, we've talked about it for the last six, nine months, as inflation settles down a little bit, there are going to be pockets, where won't be as necessary as it was a year ago. And so, that's what you're seeing now.

Q - Sheila Kahyaoglu{BIO 17240338 <GO>}

Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.

Q - Jeff Sprague{BIO 1494958 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning, everyone.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Good morning, Jeff.

Q - Jeff Sprague{BIO 1494958 <GO>}
Hey, good morning. Hey, just a two-parter on kind of Aero OE. I mean, it looks like you're making pretty good progress, as you stated, and you acknowledged some supply chain issues. But it's a little surprised, when your customers called you out by name yesterday. Just wondering, if there's something Honeywell specific that's hung up from a delivery standpoint? Or you would just kind of point your finger further down the line to your suppliers, as just kind of part one, if you could add any color there?

And then just also on OE kind of incentive payments and the like, where do we stand for 2023 now? Is this still kind of peak year for headwinds, or does some of that maybe move into 2024, if deliveries aren't quite what you thought they might be?

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yeah. So, let me kind of start with the first part of your question. I think, you know, as we look at our output, its range is depending upon, whether it's avionics or some of the mechanical things, we're up anywhere from 20% to 40% plus. So, I think we're actually very pleased in terms of the output.

Like I can assure you that in terms of the bottlenecks, it's not Honeywell, it's not sort of throughput to our facility. So, we have a lot of issues with our supply base as well. And frankly, some of those being large public companies. I'm not going to sit here and call them out on a call like this. Frankly, it's our responsibility and it's our job to deliver. And I'm not going to use somebody else as an excuse for us not delivering. That's our job to manage. And frankly, an earnings call is not the right place to actually have those kinds of discussions.

So, we're going to work at it. We own it. I know the supply chain in Aerospace is not perfect. It's getting better and it's getting better relatively quickly, probably even better than we anticipated. But there's work to do. And there's four or five layers of the supply chain, and what we're seeing and feeling flows down to our suppliers. We're still getting some very inconsistent supply base.

I mean our decommit rate went from being 19%, 20% Q4, down to 15%, but 15% is still not good. But improving and we're making those improvements. We've launched hundreds, I mean literally hundreds of people into our supply chain to assist our suppliers, and frankly probably put more time and effort to be responsive to the needs of our OE base.

And I don't know, Greg.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Yeah. And on the incentive side, we're not making any adjustment to our expectations as far as that is concerned. It's still very early in the year. As far as we know OE deliveries are still going to be roughly in the range of what we had anticipated as we opened the year. And like you said, we expect this year is probably the peak. And then it's going to flatten out or come down slightly next year, but still be relatively high. Should that shift left or right a little bit? We'll see. But at this moment, we're keeping our expectations as they were.

A - Vimal Kapur{BIO 7493557 <GO>}
I think one point I wanted to add was, that the diversity of our portfolio in Aero is quite unique. We supply engines, avionics, navigation equipment, lighting, brakes, the list goes on. So, due to diversity, our volume is growing overall, but there could be some category, where the growth is slightly less versus others. And I think that puts us in a unique position on how we get viewed by our customers, because they obviously want growth to occur consistently across all product lines. So, I want to have that appreciation that our diversity is one of the unique factors compared to our peer group there.

Q - Jeff Sprague{BIO 1494958 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for that color. Appreciate it.

Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Joe Ritchie{BIO 16351356 <GO>}
Thanks. Good morning, everybody.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Hey, Joe.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Good morning.

Q - Joe Ritchie{BIO 16351356 <GO>}
So, Darius just wanted to stay on Aero, for my one question. I guess, as you think about the margins for the year, you guys talked about flat margins, but that started the year off down. And what's expected to improve, as the year progresses? Is there friction associated with the supply chain that's impacting the margins today? Because your aftermarket businesses growing faster than OE, so just any color unlike the what gets better in Aero from a margin standpoint as the year progresses?

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Yeah, sure. I mean, think about it this way. The first and most basic one is volume leverage, right. We are very much in control of our fixed costs and revenue is going to go up each and every quarter sequentially. And it will have a cushion though and probably the highest quarter in Q4.

So, just by that alone, we're going to get some volume lever. So, there's not like any big changes from one quarter to the next, that I would call out from a mixed perspective. Now again, that can always fluctuate as time goes by, but the single biggest thing that you should expect is really around volume leverage. It's fairly simple.

Q - Joe Ritchie{BIO 16351356 <GO>}
Okay, great. Good enough. Thanks.

Hey, good morning.

Q - Deane Dray{BIO 1722688 <GO>}
Hey, Darius, since this is your last call, just want to say congratulations on your run as CEO. And look, all CEOs want to go out on a strong note, leaving the company in good hands. And I think this quarter speaks to that. So, congrats.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Thank you. I appreciate that.

Q - Deane Dray{BIO 1722688 <GO>}
Hey, my one question on Intelligrated aftermarket, if there was always this high growth in installations and waiting to get that critical mass in the installed base to start get to the aftermarket. Have you reached that point? And, what's that mix going forward between OE and aftermarket? Thanks.

A - Vimal Kapur{BIO 7493557 <GO>}
Yes. So, no overall our performance on aftermarket has been double digits for last couple of years, including this year. In fact, we are performing extremely well, I would say, in high teens. So, we are at a point to your question on the mix now two-thirds, one-third. I think we are going towards that mix now, which is a start.

I mean this business is seven, eight years old. So, if you roll the dice 15 years from now, the mix will be probably more in favor of aftermarket, as we are experience in other parts of Honeywell. But it's trending very frankly better than our thesis, consistently north of 15%, and we're pretty pleased with that, and margins are pretty attractive.

Q - Deane Dray{BIO 1722688 <GO>}

Our next question comes from Gautum Khanna with Cowen. Gautum, your line is now open. Our next question will come from Chris Snyder with UBS.

Q - Chris Snyder{BIO 21962027 <GO>}
Thank you. So, the guidance, at least at the midpoint, it seems to suggest slightly better organic growth in the back half relative to Q2. And comes despite tough comps and maybe some macro concerns out there. So, could you just maybe provide some more color on the sub segments or business lines, where you think you could see better organic growth relative to Q2? And also, does this dynamic maybe reflect some Q2 conservatism? The prior commentary kind of said that Q2 seasonality is coming in below normalized levels. Thank you.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Sure. Again, what I would tell you is Aerospace, we expect now to have some really nice sequential organic growth as the year progresses, which is going to be a big level of support for us overall. Back to 2Q, it's very much in line with, kind of our historical trends, and so we feel good about the guided range that we're at.

In terms of the back end of the year, as far as PMT is concerned, I think, we'll have a really strong back half there as well. SPS will get actually sequentially a little bit easier as the year goes by. So, we'll probably hit the heights of our declines here in the first half and the second half will get a little bit easier and that'll take a little bit of pressure off the overall portfolio. So, I think, we're going to see really nice growth throughout the portfolio in three out of the four businesses and the easing of the SPS comps will help.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yeah, and the other factor is that, we're gaining more and more confidence in output out of aerospace. I mean, we're continuing to grow. It's the work that we've done in terms of mending the supply chain is producing results. I quoted some of the year-over-year numbers earlier. And we expect that progress to continue and even accelerate, particularly as we get into the back half of the year.

So, we're very confident in our outlook for the growth that we have. And looking forward for signs and especially order rates for HBT to see what that looks like, because obviously, our Q1 results there were also better than expectations, both in terms of revenue as well as order. So, we'll see how Q2 goes and that may offer some further upside.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Once more I want to thank our shareholders for ongoing support. I've valued our dialogue over the past seven years. I also want to thank the entire Honeywell family, including our colleagues, both present and past. We've built a tremendous company over the past two decades, and it's thanks to all your hard work and perseverance.

It has been an honor to be able to lead this company. We delivered outstanding first quarter results. More importantly, I have the utmost confidence that we'll continue to do so in the future under Vimal leadership, with the typical level of operational rigor, we've come to expect from Honeywell.

This company's best days remain ahead of us, and we look forward to discussing this further at our upcoming Investor Day next month. Thank you all for listening. Please stay safe and healthy.
