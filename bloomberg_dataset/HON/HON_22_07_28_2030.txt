Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Thank you. Sean, and good morning everyone.

Let's begin on Slide 2. The second quarter was another strong one for Honeywell. We over delivered on our commitments, as our rigorous operating principles enabled us to navigate a challenging backdrop and remain highly resilient amid ongoing supply chain constraints inflation headwinds and geopolitical unrest.

We met or exceeded our second quarter guidance, despite these challenges adjusted earnings per share of $2.10, up 4% year-over-year and $0.02 of both the high end of the guidance range. Organic sales grew 4% year-over-year, led by strong double-digit growth in our Commercial Aviation, Building Products, Productivity Solutions and Services, Advanced Sensing Technologies, Advanced Materials and the recurring connected software businesses.

This was partially offset by three percentage point impact from a combination of the wind down of our Russian operations and lower COVID related mask sales as we lapped the height of demand in 2021. We extended segment margin by 50 basis points year-over-year to 20.9%, mean the high end of the guidance range as commercial excellence enable us to remain ahead of the inflation curve. Excluding the impact of our investment Quantinuum, the margin expansion was 80 basis points year-over-year.

Orders and backlog strength continued in the second quarter, led by Aero, HBT and PMT as our end markets continue to recover, giving us confidence on our demand outlook for the back half of the year. Orders were up 12% year-over-year and closing backlog was $29.5 billion, also up 12% year-over-year.

In terms of capital we deployed $2.3 billion to share repurchases, dividends, and capital expenditures. We leveraged the strength of our balance sheet to opportunistically purchase 7.5 million shares throughout the quarter, reducing our average share count to 685 million shares and continuing to execute on our commitment to buyback $4 billion in shares in 2022.

As always we continue to execute our rigorous and proven value creation framework, which drives outstanding shareholder value. I am proud of Honeywell's ability to rise to the challenge to deliver strong results amid such a fluid operating environment.

Now let's turn to Slide 3, to discuss recent senior leadership changes. This morning we announced that Vimal Kapur has been appointed to the role of President and Chief Operating Officer, effective immediately. Vimal is currently the President and CEO of Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies and will maintain his PMT role until his successor is named.

Honeywell is fortunate to benefit from a very deep bench of experienced leaders like Vimal with 33 years across various Honeywell Businesses. As COO he will work closely with me to drive the continued profitable growth of Honeywell's operating businesses. This includes creating new solutions to help our customers drive their sustainability transformations and accelerate their digital transformation journey.

Vimal will also oversee the continued integration of Honeywell's operating system, which we call Honeywell Accelerator. Vimal is uniquely qualified for this role and has proven his operational capabilities across many different industries, business models, regions and business cycles. This support will provide me additional bandwidth to focus on strategy, business development customer engagement and people development.

Now, many of you will recall that I served as COO once upon a time as well. This announcement today is not a repeat of that playbook. I won't be Chairman and CEO indefinitely. I have no definitive plans to retire and will continue to lead Honeywell. Vimal's appointment is going to allow me additional flexibility to focus on our overarching objective.

In addition, effective earlier this month we expanded both Sheila Jordan's and Suresh Venkatarayalu's role and welcome them to the executive leadership team as Honeywell officers reporting to me to ensure we continue to advance our enterprise transformation.

Sheila expended her role to include all digital transformation efforts to become Senior Vice President, Chief Digital Technology Officer. Sheila joined Honeywell in January 2020 and has proven significant value working to modernize our IT infrastructure, applications, digital capabilities and talent.

Suresh took an expanded role becoming Senior Vice President, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer. Suresh has been in Honeywell almost 30 years and held a series of engineering and IT leadership positions, including CTO of Honeywell and SPS. Suresh is responsible for new product development and introduction, processes, including development for breakthrough technologies.

I'd like to congratulate Vimal, Sheila and Suresh on their new roles and I look forward to working closely with them as they enter the next phase of Honeywell's transformation.

Next, let me turn to Slide 4, to discuss other exciting recent announcements.

In the second quarter, we continue to build on our reputation as one of the premier providers of cutting-edge technologies that can deliver more sustainable solutions. We announced yesterday that Archer Aviation selected Honeywell to provide flight control actuation and thermal management technologies for the Urban Air Mobility aircraft. Archer's production aircraft will operate dense urban environments taking critical precision from the aircraft's flight controls and actuator is a must for civilian safety.

Honeywell's actuators can accept hundreds of micro adjustments in commands per second from fly by wire computers enabling precise navigation, which will enhance safety and accommodate the unique elements of Archer's electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. Honeywell has a wide variety of ready now solutions. It will create a more sustainable future for the aviation sector. It's a great example of that.

In addition, last month we announced a partnership with EnLink Midstream to deliver carbon capture solutions, industrial scale CO2 emitters along Louisiana Gulf Coast. Our carbon capture and hydrogen purification technologies combined with EnLink's planned CO2 pipeline transportation network provides a cost-efficient solution for customers looking to reduce the environmental impact of their operation.

Lastly, we discussed in our Q2 leadership webcast on sustainable building technologies, released a new carbon and energy management software focused on the energy optimization and carbon reduction of commercial building. Commercial buildings currently account for almost a third of global energy consumption and 37% of global energy related CO2 emissions. Building owners recognize that this issue needs to be addressed and thousands of companies have voluntarily pledged to meet sustainability targets.

Honeywell's new software offering enables building owners track and optimize energy performance down to a device per asset level. Our carbon energy management software leverages Honeywell's Forge artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to autonomously identify and implement energy conservation measures. This makes it possible for building owners to reduce the environmental impact of their building while at the same time improving the wellbeing of their occupants.

As you can see we are leveraging our expertise and culture of innovation to enable a more sustainable future.

Now let me turn it over to Greg on Slide 5 to discuss our second quarter results in more detail and to provide an update on our 2022 outlook.

Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Thank you. Darius and good morning everyone.

As Darius highlighted, we delivered second quarter results, which met or exceeded the high end of our guidance while navigating persistent macroeconomic uncertainties. Second quarter sales grew by 4% organically or 7% excluding the impact of lower COVID related mask volumes and the wind down of our operations in Russia. While demand trends remain strong, supply chain constraints continue to weigh on volume growth predominantly in Aero, HBT and SPS causing our past due backlog to increase sequentially by more than $100 million in the quarter.

However, we once again demonstrated our operational agility by staying ahead of the inflation curve through strategic pricing actions, enabling us to expand margins and beat the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance.

Aerospace sales for the second quarter were up 5% organically compared to the second quarter of 2021 as we continue to face a challenged overall aerospace supply chain. The ongoing recovery in commercial flight hours led to approximately 20% year-over-year sales growth in both air transport aftermarket and business in general aviation aftermarket sales.

Business in general aviation original equipment return to growth in the quarter growing double-digit while air Transport original equipment continue to strong 2022 growing over 25% year-over-year.

Growth from our commercial aerospace business was partially offset by Defense and Space sales, which were down 11% year-over-year, though up sequentially from Q1 in both US and international market. Aerospace segment margins expanded 80 basis points in the second quarter to 26.5%.

In Building Technologies sales were up 14% organically, led by commercial actions and strength in both Building Products and Building Solutions. Demand remained strong with orders of double digits for the second consecutive quarter led by building projects, building management systems and our security products.

Backlog grew double-digits year-over-year in the second quarter, giving us continued confidence in our 2022 outlook.

Our Healthy Buildings portfolio remains robust with over $100 million of orders in the quarter. Segment margins expanded a 110 basis points to 23.5%.

In Performance Materials and Technologies sales grew 10% organically in the quarter despite an approximately 3% headwind from Russia. Advanced Material continues to stand out with 21% organic sales growth in the quarter as a result of commercial excellence and greater volume in specialty additives and electronic materials. Process Solutions grew 7% organically on increased demand for thermal solutions and lifecycle solutions services. Sparta Systems grew over 40% and was earnings accretive for the second consecutive quarter.

Process Solutions orders grew more than 15% including double-digit growth in our project business showing continued momentum. UOP sales decreased 1% in the quarter, including a seven oint headwind to year-over-year growth from lost Russia sales. We continue to see strength in our higher margin catalyst business, which grew more than 20% and help to offset lower equipment volumes due to timing of larger projects.

PMT segment margin expanded 150 basis points to 22.3% in the quarter. Safety and Productivity Solutions sales decreased 10% organically in the quarter in line with our expectations, as strength in Advanced Sensing Technologies and Productivity Solutions and Services was offset by lower personal protective equipment and warehouse automation volume.

Elevated COVID driven mass demand in the second quarter of 2021 led to a 5% year-over-year headwind for SPS in the quarter. Advanced Sensing Technologies grew 25%. Productivity Solutions and Services grew 19% and gas detection also grew organically in the quarter, all demonstrating excellent execution in a difficult supply constrained environment.

We continue to be impressed by the performance of these businesses. This quarter marks six straight quarters of double-digit organic growth in Productivity Solutions and Services and three straight quarters for Advanced Sensing Technologies.

SPS also benefited from a licensing and settlement agreement to resolve patent related litigation with a competitor, which we entered into in the second quarter. Under this agreement, each party agreed to provide a license to its existing patent portfolio for use by the other parties existing products and Honeywell is entitled to receive upto $360 million over two years.

Honeywell received the first of these payments of $45 million in the second quarter and recognize the corresponding sales and profit in the SPS financial results. This incremental profit in the quarter was more than offset by legal costs associated with the agreement and a one-time write-down of excess COVID related mask inventory, which should close the book on that masks story.

Overall SPS segment margins contracted 140 basis points to 12.6% primarily due to the lower volume and the PPE write down.

Growth across our portfolio continues to be supported by strong results in Honeywell Connected Enterprise. We had another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, including double-digit recurring and 40% SaaS business growth year-over-year. Sparta Systems, Connected Safety and Cyber all saw growth of greater than 25% year-over-year in the quarter.

So for overall Honeywell, we exceeded our sales outlook growing top line 4% organically and we executed operationally to expand second quarter segment margins by 50 basis points to 20.9% meeting the high end of our margin guidance range with expansion in PMT, HBT and aerospace. This expansion is net of a 30 basis point year-over-year headwind associated with our investment in Quantinuum.

On EPS, we delivered second quarter GAAP earnings per share of $1.84 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 which was up $0.08 year-over-year despite a $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange. A bridge for adjusted earnings per share from 2Q 2021 to 2Q 2022 can be found in the appendix of this presentation.

Segment profit was an $0.08 tailwind driven by strong commercial execution. Share count reduction drove a $0.05 year-over-year tailwind to earnings per share. We saw a $0.04 headwind from below the line items, primarily due to the lower pension income. A higher effective tax rate 23.4% this year versus 23% last year drove a $0.01 headwind.

In response to winding down operations in Russia, we recorded an additional charge of $126 million or $0.19 impact to GAAP EPS. The company also took a $50 million non-cash charge in 2Q related to the potential comprehensive resolution of ongoing UOP matters. More information on this can be found in our Form 10-Q.

Moving to cash, we generated over $800 million of free cash flow in the quarter, down 43% year-on-year, which is closely aligned to our expectations. We continue to invest in inventory to deliver for our customers, which is driving elevated working capital in recent quarters, including Q2. During the quarter, we also received the final payment to close out our agreement with Garrett but still saw a year-over-year decline in Garrett's payments due to an elevated $375 million payment in the second quarter last year. We remain on track to deliver our cash guidance range of $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion for the full year.

Finally as Darius mentioned earlier, we continue to leverage our strong balance sheet deploying $2.3 billion in the quarter. Notably, we repurchased 7.5 million shares for $1.4 billion in the second quarter, bringing our first half total to $2.4 billion as we execute on our updated committed to buyback $4 billion in shares in 2022. We also paid approximately $690 million in dividends and invested approximately $160 million in CapEx.

So overall, another strong quarter in which we delivered results at or above our expectations, executed well through challenging economic conditions and accelerated our capital deployment.

Now let's turn to Slide 6.to talk about our third quarter and full-year guidance. While the environment continues to be volatile, our demand profile remains resilient. Our 2Q orders and our closing backlog of $29.5 billion both grew 12% year-over-year positioning us well for the quarters to come.

Supply chain constraints, particularly related to semiconductors improve slightly in the second quarter and we expect modest sequential benefits to continue throughout the back half of the year, enabling us to unlock greater volume. The aerospace supply chain has continued to face difficulties, but we're confident in the eventual recovery as tier 3 and tier 4 suppliers work to combat labor shortages.

Once again this quarter and throughout the rest of the year, we are staying ahead of the inflation curve with our strategic pricing actions.

As a result of rising interest rates and the strengthening of the US dollar, we are experiencing higher foreign currency impacts than we had in our prior guidance. Impacting sales and EPS but we are overcoming that operationally. With that as a backdrop, we expect third quarter sales to be in the range of $8.9 billion to $9.2 billion up 7% to 11% on an organic basis or up 8% to 12% excluding the one-point impact of our lost Russian sales.

We now expect full year sales of $35.5 billion to $36.1 billion which represents a decrease of $300 million in the high-end from our prior guidance, incorporating higher foreign currency effect. However, we are raising the low end of our organic growth range, now it's 5% to 7% increase in the midpoint versus our prior guidance and narrowing the overall range. That represents organic growth of 7% to 9% excluding a one point impact of lower COVID related mask demand and a one point impact of lost Russian sales.

The difference between our reported and our organic sales growth guidance is two points driven entirely by foreign currency translation. We expect our disciplined commercial actions will contribute approximately 8% to our sales growth in 2022 which is higher than we anticipated last quarter, as we remain vigilant in addressing price cost dynamic given elevated inflation.

Now let's take a moment to walk through the third quarter and full year expectations by segment. An update on our 2022 end market outlook, can be found in the appendix of this presentation.

In Aerospace, we see ongoing flight hour improvement leading to another quarter of robust growth in our aftermarket business led by air transport aftermarket. In original equipment build rates continue to ramp driving growth in both Air Transport and Business and General Aviation.

Defense and Space grew sequentially in the second quarter and we expect this trend to continue into the second half. We anticipate the business will return to year-over-year growth in the second half as comp eases [ph] but it will be down slightly for the full year.

As I mentioned earlier, the overall aerospace supply chain remains challenged and is partially offsetting strong end market demand. While our supplier do commit rate improved sequentially in the second quarter, the pace of improvement is slower than the higher end of our expectations. As a result, we now expect Aerospace sales for the year to be up mid single digits, compared to 2021 lower than our previous outlook of high single-digit. Original equipment mix headwinds were well-telegraphed but lower volume leverage will weigh on full year margin, which we now expect to be down modestly year-over-year.

In Building Technologies, where supply chain constraints particularly around semiconductors have improved slightly each quarter so far in 2022, we expect sequentially improve volumes and pricing actions will support continued growth into the second half of the year. Energy efficiency and Healthy Building Solutions remain a priority for our customers enabling growth in our Building Solutions and Healthy Building Business.

We now expect full-year organic growth in the double digits trending better than our outlook at the end of the first quarter of high single digits to double-digit. Our operational excellence and additional volume leverage should allow us to build upon our margin expansion from the first half in the third quarter and throughout the rest of 2022.

In Performance Material and Technologies the favorable outlook on our end markets and two consecutive quarters of double-digit orders growth provides a solid footing for the future. In Process Solutions we expect sequential improvement in the third quarter with continued strong demand for thermal solutions leading the year-over-year growth. We expect sequential growth in UOP throughout the remainder of the year, largely driven by increased refining catalyst shipments with a heavier margin benefit in the fourth quarter versus the third.

As we discussed last quarter, Russia will be a headwind to year-over-year growth throughout 2022 but we're optimistic about the potential capacity investments in the energy sector to offset Russian supply, especially in LNG and these investments provide support for our long-term growth framework. We expect the typical seasonality in Advanced Materials as we exit the summer months. The pricing tailwinds and solid demand support continued year-over-year growth in the back half.

For overall PMT, we now expect sales to be up high-single digits for the year, an upgrade from our outlook last quarter about mid to high single digit and we expect segment margin expansion in the second half versus the first.

Looking ahead for SPS, we expect continued growth in Advanced Sensing Technologies and gas detection as demand indicators have remained strong and these businesses are supported by a robust backlog and we expect modest sequential improvement throughout the back half of the year.

As we enter into the second half, we expect our personal protective equipment sales run rate to be relatively stable in the third and the fourth quarter. In Intelligrated we are encouraged by the improvements we're making in our operational efficiency and strategic customer wins, which will enable greater profitability over the project lifecycle. That said we're seeing capital spending plans of our warehouse automation customers push to the right some of which has been broadly publicized. While we remain very confident in the medium-term growth rate, we expect 2022 SPS revenue to decline mid single digits versus 2021 as delivery slide to the right.

As I mentioned earlier, segment margin in the second quarter was lower by one-time inventory write-down. So we expect significant sequential margin improvement in the third quarter and continued expansion in the fourth quarter through a combination of higher volume leverage, some cost reductions and positive mix shift.

For overall Honeywell we expect third quarter segment margins to be in the range of 20.9% to 21.2% resulting in year-over-year margin contraction of 30 basis points to flat, due to timing of high margin catalyst shipments in PMT and some mix headwinds in Aerospace. Excluding the 40 basis point headwind from Quantinuum we expect margins to expand 10 basis points to 40 basis points. From a sequential perspective, our third quarter margin expectations are flat to up 30 basis points.

Turning to our other core guided metrics third quarter net below the line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax is expected to be in the range of negative $20 million to positive $30 million with a range of repositioning between $50 million and $90 million in the quarter as we continue to fund attractive restructuring projects.

We expect the third quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 24% and the average share count to be approximately $679 million shares. As a result, we expect adjusted third quarter EPS between $2.10 and $2.20 up 4% to 9% year-over-year.

Turning to the full year, we expect organic sales growth of 5% to 7% up from 47% last quarter. We are upgrading our segment margin expectations by 20 basis points to 30 basis points to 70 basis points of year-over-year expansion at a margin rate of 21.3% to 21.7%. This is supported by successful execution of our price cost strategies as well as our continued rigor on fixed cost management.

Excluding the 30 basis point headwind from Quantinuum we expect margins to expand 60 basis points to 100 basis points in the year.

We expect full year net below the line impact to be in the range of negative $150 million to negative $50 million including capacity of $350 million to $425 million of repositioning. We expect the full-year effective tax rate of approximately 22% and we expect a weighted average share count to be in the range of $684 million to $687 million shares for the year, reflecting our commitment to repurchase $4 billion of Honeywell shares in 2022.

As a result of all these inputs, we have raised the low end of our full year adjusted earnings per share expectations to $8.55 to $8.80, up 6% to 9% year-over-year, reflecting confidence in our ability to more than offset a $0.05 foreign exchange headwind versus our initial guidance in February as well as navigate evolving external risks. We still expect to see free cash flow in the range of $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion in 2022 or $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion, excluding the impact of Quantinuum.

The cash impact in timing of our Russia exit does remain uncertain and we'll update you as that continues to develop as it is not contemplated in the guide. So in total, we executed a strong Q2 despite supply chain, foreign currency, Russia and inflation headwind and are raising the midpoint of our organic sales growth, Adjusted EPS growth and segment margin ranges while holding our cash range demonstrating our strong operational capabilities.

Before turning it back to Darius, let's turn to the next page, to discuss our ability to deliver in all economic cycles.

During our Investor Day earlier this year, we talked about our track record of managing through the cycle. Our execution through multiple downturns highlights our ability to move quickly and decisively to protect margins, drive growth, ensure liquidity and position ourselves for recovery.

As we continue to maneuver through changing economic conditions, our favorable end market exposures, robust orders and backlog position and diligent cost management will enable us to deliver differentiated results for our shareholders as we have proven in the past. We believe our end market exposures will help us remain resilient during times of short cycle demand softness. In fact 65% of our sales address the Commercial Aviation, Defense, Energy and non-residential end markets, which are all set up favorably to weather a potential recession.

In Commercial Aviation pent-up demand for leisure and business travel will continue to drive aftermarket demand particularly as international travel resumes. Defense will remain relatively stable as international budgets are poised to increase with restocking from NATO allies adding upward momentum to this end market.

The energy markets are also gaining traction with higher relatively stable oil prices supporting an expected wave of capital reinvestment and LNG capacity additions, which are required to replace Russian gas supply and power the energy transition.

Infrastructure bills both domestic and abroad provide tailwinds for the non-residential sector as does increased customer focus on sustainability and healthy building. As I mentioned earlier, although we are seeing some near term softness in ecommerce [ph], we still believe the medium-term growth is robust.

As Darius mentioned earlier, we ended 2Q with a record high backlog of $29.5 billion, up 12% year-on-year. Approximately 60% of this backlog is more on cycle, which grew 12% year-over-year, led by growth in Commercial Aviation, Building Projects and Services and Process Solutions projects. This gives us ample runway to support growth in the quarters to come.

Finally, our long track record of segment margin expansion through multiple downturns and recessionary period indicates our superior ability to streamline our fixed cost base. simplify and automate operations with our integrated supply chain transformation efforts and create efficiencies using Honeywell Digital capabilities to standardize business models and use data analytics to optimize productivity and growth.

In fact, Honeywell Digital has proven very valuable over the last year. The tools we have built are helping us methodically and strategically implement pricing enabling us to stay ahead of the inflation curve. This coupled with our rigorous and proven Honeywell value creation framework should provide investors with comfort that we will remain highly resilient, perform in all economic cycles and consistently deliver superior shareholder return.

Now let me turn it back to Darius to talk about how we are leveraging our resources and expertise to positively impact our communities.

Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Thank you, Greg.

Let's turn to Slide 8 and talk about the more aspirational approach we're taking to our ESG commitments. At Honeywell our commitment to improving the world beyond our product portfolio begins with our four pillars of Corporate Social Responsibility - inclusion diversity, employees in action, STEM education and sustainability. We're embedding inclusion diversity into all our systems and processes at Honeywell through out enterprise wide hiring protocols to our supplier diversity program. Our 9000 employees belong to one of the eight diverse employee networks and the number is growing every day allowing us to provide opportunities for the education and (inaudible) to all employees.

We believe this approach is not only the right thing to do, but also a fundamental enabler of improved business results. Honeywell has set the guide rails for our culture of inclusion and diversity and our employees consistently go beyond what is expected and improve that culture. When Honeywell set up the Ukraine relief fund to provide underground aid and employee support, the generosity of our employees helped us raise over $1 million. Our employees are active outside of work in the local communities as well, volunteering over 4,000 hours in 2021.

Honeywell's also committed to improving our local communities through STEM education to shape the great minds of tomorrow. We are focusing on providing unserved students access to education that will drive innovation. Some of our initiatives include education and skill development programs in high growth regions, college scholarships for students in STEM pathways and refurbished laptop distribution program.

Another way, Honeywell improves local communities through sustainability organizations that protect our environment and create a greener world. From partnership with Swades Foundation and Americares India Foundation, we've helped provide over 10,000 Indian homes with access to drinking water and solar electricity. Each pillars of our Honeywell to use resources to create a long-lasting positive impact in the lives of our employees in the communities they live in around the world.

Now let's turn to Slide 9, for some closing thoughts before we move into Q&A. We continue to execute on our value creation framework effectively managing through ongoing external difficulties and over-delivering on our financial commitments. We remain optimistic about our future including our ability to deliver differentiated results through the cycle.

We raised the midpoint of our full-year organic sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance as well as increased our segment margin rate fully absorbing higher than previously anticipated foreign exchange impact.

I'm proud of everyone at Honeywell who is working hard to adapt and deliver this challenging environment. While there is a heightened level of macro uncertainty at present, we continue to be confident in our ability to execute on the factors within our control.

With that, Sean, let's move to Q&A.

Sean Meakim{BIO 18984047 <GO>}

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions)

Our first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P Morgan. Steve Tusa, your line is open.

Q - Steve Tusa{BIO 4278663 <GO>}
Hi guys, good morning.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Good morning.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Good morning.

Q - Steve Tusa{BIO 4278663 <GO>}
Just on the defense business, what are you hearing there and what are you expecting for the second half and then the next year?.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yes, well, as you saw the business was still down in Q2, but if you combine the long cycle in the launch cycle bookings for the first half, it's actually been up year-over-year. So now things are looking better. Obviously, as we look at the Ukraine situation and the focus of a lot of our NATO allies, you anticipate some positive tailwinds in the next 6 months to 12 months. So similar to what some of the other peer companies particularly in defense reported, we do expect that to be a tailwind as we head into 2023 and beyond, obviously it's been a bit of a headwind so far for us this year.

Q - Steve Tusa{BIO 4278663 <GO>}
And then a follow-up, what's going on in the UOP? I mean I would have expected maybe a little bit more growth there.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yes, well UOP was if you think about one business that got hit disproportionately hard by Russia, it was UOP. I mean it was a substantial headwind and I think it was.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
We were down one in UOP and seven pont of that is Russia, so it's plus six.

Q - Steve Tusa{BIO 4278663 <GO>}
Right.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
That absorbed most of the Russia hit and actually we had some very robust bookings for Russia which were canceled.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell, your line is open.

Q - Julian Mitchell{BIO 21229700 <GO>}
Hi, good morning. Wanted to try and understand the firm wide sales and margin construct. So I think sort of sequentially in Q3 you're looking at flattish sales and flattish segment margins and then into Q4 we have a $300 million revenue uplift and a 200 point segment margin uplift. Trying to understand, is it really SPS that has that very big margin hockey stick at the end of the year? And also within aerospace you did allude to some margin pressures and maybe help us frame the scale of those and the factors behind them.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Sure. So I think what you're going to see as we go through the remainder of the year is, as you mentioned 3Q is going to look a lot like 2Q broadly speaking, and as we get into Q4, we're going to get our normal sort of seasonal uplift in revenue, which brings along with that some nice our fixed cost leverage. On top of that we're going to get some mix favorability we expect UOP in particular to be very strong in Q4. You know that our PMT margins can be pretty lumpy with individual UOP catalyst shipments moving that needle. And we have a pretty strong Q4 plug in there and we are also taken some cost actions in SPS in particular where we talked to you about the relative challenges and in top line. So that's how I would think about the setup as we go into the back half.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yes, Julian, in summary it's probably three primary things. Number one is PMT mix, particularly in UOP, which is favorable and we know it pretty well because it's a long-cycle business. Number two, is some leverage and some cost actions particularly in SPS which will provide us margin favorability and a bit more volume leverage also in Q4, because as you kind of look through the year that equation will shift from more price gains to more volume leverage as we get to Q4. So that's why Q4 looks a bit more a bit higher in terms of margin profile.

This is very much in line of our original model. So there is nothing really dramatically different than what we expected.

Q - Julian Mitchell{BIO 21229700 <GO>}
And as the follow-up, is there any color on the Aero margin pressure you mentioned.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Yes, I would just say we presented something in the 26-ish range in Q2 and I would expect that to stay in that neighborhood through the remainder of the year directionally. We'd probably get again a little bit of a lift in Q4 with some extra volume, but previously we had thought that would be a little bit more robust with higher revenue profile. But as I discussed earlier, that's where we're probably on the lower end of our range of expectations of supply chain healing and output. And so, just a little bit of volume leverage loss relative to the high end than what we had hopeful. And due to primarily very robust OE demand, which obviously is a from a mix perspective is negative, but really nothing there that's different than our expectations.

Hey Scott

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Hi good morning Scott.

Q - Scott Davis{BIO 2393277 <GO>}
You are one of the few companies, I think we're going to see this quarter with gross margins up, I think they up 60 bps. Would you characterize that because of you are ahead of the curve on price cost or is it some mix health and benefit? I know that you keep fixed cost down and that's helpful, certainly when you have unit volumes, but I would imagine net of price for unit volumes this quarter weren't very positive. So can you help kind of?

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yes, sure. Absolutely. Let me help unpack that certainly we're trying to stay ahead of inflation that's been a playbook we're trying to get price where we can and I, we have pretty good metrics and visibility and exactly where inflation is how it's broken down by business unit, how we're seeing it. And now we've embedded that into our operating system such that we can identify it act and we do that in multiple ways. I mean obviously price is one lever, managing the mix to things that we know we can sell at our higher margin for both on some redesigns, which are also net helpful, also generate some cost benefit. The thing I'm particularly pleased about is, I can tell you full transparency nine months ago, that was not part of our playbook. I think we stumbled a little bit nine months ago and I'm really thrilled because now as part of our operating system, we know what to do. It's underpinned by the fact we have great data visibility, great analytics, one source of truth which really enables us to take much more precise management actions to manage the headwinds we've seen in inflation.

Hey Sheila.

Q - Sheila Kahyaoglu{BIO 17240338 <GO>}
The guys stole my aerospace question, so maybe on Intelligrated and warehouse that was down sharply in the quarter as you expected. But you called out greater profitability over the cycle. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes and how you're envisioning that business improved?

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yes, I mean, I think some of the warehouse kind of overcapacity in the market has been pretty well publicized. So I'm not going to dwell on that. I mean, obviously, we're seeing that through and frankly we forget that business grew at 50%, 2021 and at a similar rate in 2020. So I think that, frankly, what it needs to happen is that some of the capacity to be absorbed, we're very excited about the future of warehouse automation. So this is a bit of a blip for the next few quarters, On mid-term we think that this is going to be still very good business. And you're right, from a mix perspective although there is obviously to the top line there is an impact from a margin mix perspective, this will be net helpful because our LSS business is growing and our projects that we are securing are at higher margin rates. So net-net, this is not something we're particularly that worried about. I mean, we wish the business was there from a topline perspective, but overall I think that this, we will be definitely able to weather and we still love the segment that we're in, in warehouse automation.

Good morning.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Hey, good morning Andrew.

Q - Andrew Obin{BIO 6337802 <GO>}
Hey, how are you. A question on the new COO role. And could you give us more of your thought process there and specifically historically, we've been getting questions on Honeywell and M&A, does that mean Darius, you're going to spend more time on strategic alternatives? And does the world look any different to you now post the market corrections and what's been happening there? Thanks.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yes, well, I mean, I think, let me talk little bit about the COO role and be more specific. I mean, as you can imagine we do a lot of the operational output that we get don't happen by accident. It takes a lot of hard work and attention to detail and (inaudible) data and so on and I kind of found myself maybe more in the middle of that than maybe I wanted to be, it's good and bad. And frankly some of these other aspects and M&A and BD is certainly one of those, is an area that I probably should be spending a little bit more time in. But I would add to that customer outreach and people development strategy and some of the other brand building things that frankly I should be doing.

To be very transparent, I've talked about that openly to my own staff multiple times. And I think the best way to kind of solve that is to really partner with Vimal to be the COO. I mean he's got a great track record at Honeywell, he has been extraordinarily successful in running HBT, he has run HPS, he has run PMT, he has got 33 years worth of experience. There aren't too many mysteries to Vimal that he doesn't know at Honeywell with that kind of multi business experience and multi-continent experience because he has lived in Asia, Europe and in North America. So he's going to be a great partner for us to do things and I think this is going to be a net positive for Honeywell because it will allow me to do some other things that are going to be very beneficial and yes. BD and M&A is going to be one of those.

Q - Andrew Obin{BIO 6337802 <GO>}
Got you. And then a follow-up question on strength in Advanced Materials came in a little bit stronger than I would have thought. Can you just comment what specifically going on there and how sustainable it is? Thanks a lot.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yes, we love our Advanced Materials business. I mean, you're seeing a lot of things, you're seeing the strength of our Solstice business really picking up, we kind of forget that we have enough Electronic Materials business, I mean the only Electronic Materials and Chemicals business based in the US, so you can imagine what kind of future that has. And the business is very robust, we've invested in capacity expansion, those capacity expansions are not even yet shown in our results and really come to fruition in 2023.

So not only are we excited about how the business is performing in 2022, things could get even better for 2023. So we're very thrilled with the performance of the past (inaudible).

Q - Andrew Obin{BIO 6337802 <GO>}

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.

Q - Nigel Coe{BIO 3818998 <GO>}
Congratulations to Vimal. Actually I was going to ask about the COO role, but that's been asked already. Maybe clarify Darius, is Vimal going to continue to be leader of PMT or is that going to transition over time? But my real question is around the consumer and obviously Resideo and Garrett took a lot of the direct consumer exposure away from Honeywell. But in terms of your second half framework, given the way that a lot of the consumer-facing stocks are blowing up and we start to June, July starting to see that impact. To what extent have you dialed in weaker trends within, I don't know refrigerants, electronics, handhelds within SPS? Any kind of concerns you've seen there? Thanks.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yes. So let me unpack because there's really two questions. Let me very quickly open the PMT question. So no, we don't envision Vimal holding on to both roles. But what we wanted to do is to make sure that it became clear that the PMT role is open because there's always when we have big roles like that open, we want to consider internal and external candidates. And frankly, it's much tougher to recruit when a role is vacated. So he's going to serve in both roles as you can imagine early on he is going to pay a lot of attention to PMT. But as we fill that role he is going to take over more of the COO. So that's the first part.

Yes. We've seen some of the same outputs on the consumer and you're right, we don't have a lot of consumer exposure. I mean, most of that consumer exposure went away with the two spins. So that's spot on as well. You know, we see it a little bit indirectly I talked about it in the Intelligrated play because there was some level of assumption that this consumer demand would keep on going. It's kind of slowed down and consumers have a little bit of a different behavior. So we see it there.

But I would say this, if you go back to 2020 right after the pandemic hit us, we probably had one of the most unfavorable pandemic portfolio, you could have out that, right. I mean, our two biggest businesses were Aerospace and Energy and frankly, other than maybe hospitality those got hit about as hard as anything else.

Well, I think we're kind of entering a little bit of a different cycle, and I actually think that no matter what you count in terms of the recession period, I don't see a substantial reduction in OE build rates for aerospace, air travel. There's a lot of pent-up demand and you see it. You see it more on the consumer side, and my bet is you're going to see it more and more on the business side, there is still a lot of pent-up demand to travel and let's be honest, a wide-body at least international travel is nowhere near where it was in 2019.

So I think we're entering a cycle year which is actually going to have a very favorable market mix market conditions. Obviously that underpinned by the kind of backlog position we have. So we're cautiously optimistic that even in a recessionary environment which may happen I think, we're still going to do quite well.

Q - Nigel Coe{BIO 3818998 <GO>}

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie, your line is open.

Q - Joe Ritchie{BIO 16351356 <GO>}
Hi, good morning, everyone, and congrats to everybody on the promotions.

My, question is really just around pricing. So, I think last quarter you guys talked about five point, the price coming through for the year. I'm curious what's the expectation now. And then also clearly like you guys are building up a pretty good war chest here with backlog of almost $30 million. Want to understand how you guys are thinking about the pricing that's in that backlog and with commodities deflating right now, could you see a nice little boost in 2023 as you start to deliver some of that backlog?

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Sure. So you're right, we talked about 5% for the year quarter ago, we now see that as being more like an 8% number for 2022. so nice progress for the first two quarters and that kind of carrying through. Pricing our backlog has been something that's been very important to us. Obviously that's got a lot more challenges to it. Then new orders coming in but we have been successful in doing that in certain areas of the portfolio. So we expect to be able to retain a good bit of that pricing. I think we found that our pricing has been very sticky over time.

Q - Joe Ritchie{BIO 16351356 <GO>}
And maybe Greg just answering that question on the commodities deflating, does that impact your business at all this year? Is that more like a 2023 event? If we continue to see base metal prices stay at current levels which has been on a downward trajectory for the last several weeks?

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Yes, I would say when we look at it, there are some commodities that are seeing some of that deflation. But overall for our total portfolio of direct materials that's sort of cherry picking and overall, we still see a net increase.

Q - Joe Ritchie{BIO 16351356 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks, guys.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Overall your theory is right, that is some of these commodities come down. We may have an opportunity as we get into '23 for some margin expansion. It obviously varies by commodity, some of them are indexed, some of them are not. But directionally, I think your assertion is correct.

Good morning.

Q - Andy Kaplowitz{BIO 15179203 <GO>}
Darius, you raised HBT expected growth from high single digits to double digits. Are the primary markets in HBT growing that fast or these share gains at HBT continues to achieve, maybe this is a big uptick you're seeing in high growth markets and how are you thinking about HBT's European exposure?

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
I think, it's a little bit of both. I mean, certainly the business is growing. What I'm particularly excited about is that, HBT has the kind of solutions that our customers are seeking, both in terms of energy conservation, in terms of healthy buildings,healthy environments, clean air, visibility to their energy usage, visibility to their carbon emissions. All of these are either solutions that we currently have in our portfolio and there isn't a customer out there that's not interested. And that's reflected in their booking rates, I mean booking rates will pretty much double digits almost across the board for every one of their businesses. So the right portfolio, right solutions and the business is doing very, very well.

Q - Andy Kaplowitz{BIO 15179203 <GO>}
And Darius, HBT European exposure and general European exposure, you're seeing anything there?

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
No, not yet. I mean frankly our business in Germany, which is obviously the biggest economy was actually up significantly in Q2, so we're not kind of seeing any signs yet of any kind of a hiccup. We're watching this as much as everybody else. We are as concerned as everybody else around the energy profile as Europe heads into the winter but so far so good in terms of what we saw here in Q2.

Q - Josh Pokrzywinski{BIO 16605674 <GO>}
Hi, good morning guys.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Hi, Josh.

Q - Josh Pokrzywinski{BIO 16605674 <GO>}
So just a follow-up on PMT. I guess a couple of unique drivers this cycle maybe versus what we've seen in the past. I guess, on one hand you've had refining margins blow out through your upside here pretty quickly and maybe some snap responses by those customers to drive spending this year, but it's still a long-cycle business, hard to get too much going inside of a 6 or 12-month period. As much as it's good this year, are you guys pulling things forward potentially from '23, is it still building momentum here? How do you see the unique aspects of this environment? The driving momentum or duration versus other cycles in that business.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yes. So, we are certainly not pulling anything from 2023, let's be very clear about that. There is no pullings, we don't need to do pullings because the business is robust. What we're excited about is the LNG cycle. I mean, you see that investment taking place. You see it in the Middle East, you see it in the US, we are participating in it, UOP's participating. We have some very robust bookings that you saw in Q2 year. We actually expect more robust bookings in the second half of the year and we're very much part of that LNG cycle.

Another really important data point, which is I don't know if this is well publicized but we are also the leading player in renewable fuels with green fuels. And the solutions there just this year, our expectation is that the bookings in that segment to be up 3x versus what they were in 2021. So we are very excited. We're kind of playing on the both ends of the barbell when it comes to the energy infrastructure, and I think this is exactly where you want to be. The world needs energy right now and it's most likely going to come from natural gas and there's got to be a build out, there is going to be infrastructure build out, there is going to be E&P that takes place to supply the world with natural gas. You see that particularly pronounced in Europe. We're playing in that.

We are also playing on sustainability and renewables, in renewable fuels and I just gave you the very specific data point on green sustainable fuels where we're really a leader in that space. We're having more and more wins in plastics recycling. We have a pilot going on in battery storage. So just about every relevant. I talked a little bit earlier in the earnings call about partnership in carbon capture. So just about anything you want to do in sustainability and renewable economy of the future, we also do. So we're going to benefit from both sides of this energy transition and you see it in the booking right this quarter.

Thank you. Good morning, everyone.

Hey Deane.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Hi. Good morning.

Q - Deane Dray{BIO 1722688 <GO>}
A couple cleanup questions for Darius. Good to hear that the semiconductor situation, it seems to be bottoming, just some color on de-commits and your expectations for the second half, is it going to be a linear improvement, do you expect it to be choppy? And then for Greg, anything on Russia in terms of other write-downs that and although they are excluded, but the wind down of Russia, is that complete yet. Thank you.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
Yes, Greg, let me take the first one. Yes, I mean I think in terms of recovery under supply chain broadly it's going to be very, very gradual. There is no a magic unlock that's going to happen in one quarter and all of this then everything will now sort of get flushed through our backlogs and so on. I think it's been a very fragile sort of, the de-commits you're probably referring to, because I gave some specific numbers on that and last quarter around Aerospace and just to give you a little bit of an update on that. Q1 was at 22.5% and 23% in that range. Q2 was better but it wasn't as good as we had hoped. It came in at just a shade over 21% on the de-commit, so better than Q1, but we're kind of hoping something around the 2019 to 2020 range, but we saw improvement. We expect that improvement to continue gradually. We also saw about a 3% improvement in output Q-over-Q. So overall some level of progress but it's going to be gradual and that's kind of what we're penciling in for the next few quarters, which is gradual level of improvement both in the semi space as well as some of the aerospace supply chain. That's kind of what our standard case is, we hope for the better. We deployed a small army into the supply chain particularly in the aerospace segment to help our suppliers get upto rate.

But it's challenging because it's not the suppliers that are kind of, let's call them tier 3 suppliers that really feed us, the tier 4 and even tier 5 suppliers that are struggling and this problem will be solved. I have no doubt it will solve but there is no instant gratification.

A - Greg Lewis{BIO 20594853 <GO>}
Yes. And then on the Russia side, Deane. I mean, I'd say we have taken the bulk of the write-downs associated with our balance sheet as it relates to Russia in the first quarter that was really around our unbilled receivables in the second quarter. We took down essentially all of our PP&E and any other related assets down to essentially zero at this point.

What we're really working through now is cash implications of all of that and it's going to be a legal matter that will probably take quarters and well into 2023 as all of the aspects of (inaudible) export control compliance comes into play. So it's not going to be a simple wind down but from a write down perspective, I would say the bulk of it has happened at this point.

Q - Deane Dray{BIO 1722688 <GO>}
Thank you.

A - Darius Adamczyk{BIO 18702500 <GO>}
And, Deane. As you know we've absorbed the FX impact as well into our guidance range, which was a nickel on the EPS range and on a year-over-year basis, it's actually a $0.14 headwind, so.

Q - Deane Dray{BIO 1722688 <GO>}
