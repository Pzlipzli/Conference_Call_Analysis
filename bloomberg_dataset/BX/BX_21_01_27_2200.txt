Presentation
Operator
Good day everyone and welcome to the Blackstone's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Investor Call, hosted by Weston Tucker, Head of Investor Relations. My name is Leslie, and I'm the event manager. During the presentation, your lines will remain on listen-only. (Operator Instructions) And I'd like to advise all parties, that the conference is being recorded for replay purposes.

And now I would like to hand you over to your host for today, Weston, please go ahead.

Weston Tucker{BIO 17237570 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Leslie, and good morning and welcome to Blackstone's fourth quarter conference call. Joining today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO; Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chae, Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-K report later next month.

I'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and outside of the firm's control and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. For discussion of some of the risks that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K and 10-Q filings. We'll also refer to certain non-GAAP measures, and you'll find reconciliations in the press release on the shareholders page of our website.

Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blackstone fund. This audiocast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent. So a quick recap of our results. We reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $1.8 billion. Distributable earnings were $1.5 billion, or $1.13 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $0.96 per share to be paid to holders of record as of February 8th.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.

Stephen A. Schwarzman{BIO 1404170 <GO>}
Thanks, Weston, and good morning and thank you for joining our call. Blackstone reported exceptional results for the fourth quarter, including our best quarter for both distributable earnings and fee-related earnings in 35 years. Realizations rose to a record $21 billion, as global markets recovers from the trough of the crisis. At the same time, we deployed $25 billion into new investments also a new record adding to the foundation of future value.

The power of the Blackstone brand has never been stronger. We achieved nearly $100 billion of inflows in 2020, ending the year with industry record AUM of $619 billion. While these results would be remarkable in any environment, they are particularly sell in a year where the world faced unprecedented challenges, including the steepest economic downturn in modern history. Our business is built to navigate the difficult periods and to deliver for our investors in good times and bad. Limited partners around the world know that by investing with the best alternative managers they can generate better returns than by investing in traditional asset classes alone. That's why capital flows have increasingly migrated towards the alternatives asset class and to Blackstone in particular. We believe this trend will continue, particularly in an environment where interest rates are expected to remain historically low.

Blackstone is the reference institution in our rapidly growing sector that is relatively acknowledged by third parties. For example, Morgan Stanley published a report entitled 30 for '21 [ph], naming Blackstone as one of the best companies in any industry based on it's review of business quality and competitive positioning. We continue to take market share raising well over $200 billion over the past two years comparable to the fund-raising of our next three largest peers combined with the most recognized brands of institutions and retail investors. And our unique culture continues to set us apart characterized by the highest standards of excellence and an unwavering dedication to serving our clients. We have extraordinarily capable people at every level of the firm as well as the ability to recruit exceptional talent in the occasional circumstance where we look externally for someone to help us build a business.

Our investment process is highly differentiated, including a rigorous focus on choosing the best sectors and assets, always with a priority of protecting capital. This is evident in the way we concentrated nearly half of our state portfolio in global logistics and life science offices in the years ahead of the recent downturn. Our positioning helped drive 1,100 basis points of outperformance for our opportunistic real estate funds last year as compared to the public REIT index, that's 1,100 basis points outperformance. And unlike investing in public stocks, we create value in our investments through our expansive portfolio operations and asset management capabilities. The result is the exceptional long term investment performance that defines us as a firm, including 15% net returns annual in both Corporate Private Equity and opportunistic real estate for three decades.

The power of our brand has been continuously reinforced by our performance to market cycles of the past 35 years. This was particularly true during the global financial crisis when we extended our leadership position in every area and launched multiple new businesses setting this stage to the next decade of remarkable growth. Since our IPO, which immediately preceded the financial crisis, we've grown our AUM 7 times, launched 34 new strategies and significantly expanded our business internationally. We are similarly emerging from this most recent downturn with powerful momentum. Jon will describe the broad range of growth initiatives we have underway across the firm, many of which are in the earliest stages of their vast potential. As we continue to grow, our capital base is shifting towards perpetual strategies, such as real estate core plus infrastructure, insurance solutions and private credit. These areas are characterized by large scale investor allocations, as well as a much larger universe of potential deployment opportunities than where we focused historically.

As the nature of the (Technical Difficulty) so does our earnings mix to a steadier and more recurring fee related earnings, which is highly valued by the market. For the full year, FRE reached $1.97 per share, effectively achieving our Investor Day target of $2 per share, but one year earlier and notwithstanding the pandemic. FRE comprised approximately two thirds of total earnings in 2020, up from only one third in 2017. Looking forward, we have great confidence in our continued FRE momentum, which should further support the revaluation of our earnings multiple that has been underway since our corporate conversion.

As we move into 2021, all signs point to it being another strong year for the firm. The pandemic will further impact the economy over the next several months with widespread and effective deployment of vaccines, which we anticipate will occur, we expect a robust recovery in global growth later this year. And as the economy accelerates, Blackstone is well positioned to continue strong growth ahead. I couldn't be more proud for our firm's people, our culture and the prospects for the future for both our limited partners and our fellow shareholders.

And with that, I'm very glad to turn it over to Jon.

Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We just completed a record quarter. I'll take you through some of the highlights, as well as the extraordinary range of growth engines that are firing across every area of the firm with a major emphasis on perpetual capital. The foundation of our business of course remains performance. When we deliver great returns, it builds investor trust and leads to further inflows. It's a virtuous circle that also involves attracting top talent moving into new areas and growing meaningfully.

In the fourth quarter, our funds again posted exceptional returns across the board. For the past several years, we've been orienting the firm towards faster growing areas, such as life sciences and those connected to the digital economy. These continue to be amongst the best performing sectors of the market and we're the largest drivers of appreciation in our funds, including our holdings in global logistics, digital payments, and enterprise software.

Our investment performance is creating very favorable dynamics with our customers and they continue to allocate more capital to us. Inflows were $32 billion in the fourth quarter and reached $95 billion for the full-year, the fourth consecutive year approaching or exceeding $100 billion. Last January before the crisis, we told you we thought we'd reach this level again in 2020. We're pleased we were still able to achieve our original goal, a testament to the confidence our investors place in us.

Looking forward, demand for our products remains as strong as ever, including for new areas that represent tremendous potential. In growth equity, we expect our inaugural vehicle to soon reach its $4.5 billion hard cap. Our Life Sciences business is deploying capital at a rapid pace and is well positioned for growth. In private equity, we are raising our second Asia fund, which we expect to be meaningfully larger than the first. And in Tactical Opportunities, we begun raising our fourth vintage in the context of continued strong performance and deployment. In real estate, our Core+ platform has grown to $69 billion, up 50% year-over-year across five perpetual capital vehicles. We launched the fifth BPP Life Sciences in the fourth quarter with the recapitalization of BioMed, raising $8.4 billion so far.

We've been actively investing this new capital, and in addition to BioMed committed in Q4 to acquire a large portfolio of lab offices adjacent to MIT and Cambridge, the world's leading biotech hub. BREIT, our largest Core+ vehicle now has $22 billion of AUM, up seven-fold since our 2018 Investor Day. On the back of strong performance, fundraising has reaccelerated meaningfully from the bottom of the crisis with approximately $900 million of inflows on January 1st. Investor demand for resilient income-producing assets coupled with the Blackstone brand is a powerful combination. As we've stated before, we believe BREIT could become the single largest earnings driver at Blackstone. Perpetual AUM across the firm has more than doubled since Investor Day to $135 billion, helping drive a 73% increase in fee-related earnings over the same period. In addition to real estate, our perpetual capital vehicles in infrastructure and direct lending are seeing strong momentum and have grown to leading scale only a few years after launch.

In infrastructure, we raised $14 billion initially and are now seeing deal activity accelerate in both the U.S. and Europe, bringing the fund to approximately 40% committed. In credit, our Global Direct Lending platform has grown to $22 billion, one of the largest in the world. Our scale allows us to provide bigger and more comprehensive capital solutions to borrowers. And the opportunity is enormous with sub-investment grade financing markets in the U.S. alone totaling nearly $3 trillion. Post quarter-end, we launched our non-traded BDC, BCRED with over $800 million of commitments at the first closing.

As with BREIT, we anticipate strong monthly demand from individual investors for Blackstone managed income solutions. Also in credit, we acquired DCI in the fourth quarter, a pioneer in systematic investment strategies, which we see as central for the future of liquid fixed income investing. DCI will meaningfully expand our capabilities in the vast high yield and investment-grade markets and will further differentiate our business as we integrate their technology across the credit platform. In total, the Credit & Insurance segment reported inflows of $13 billion in the quarter and $28 billion for the full-year.

Turning to BAAM, we continue to see strong demand for our various direct investing strategies, including our second GP stakes perpetual capital vehicle, which has raised $4 billion to-date. We were excited to announce recently that Joe Dowling, former CEO of Brown University's Investment Office is joining Blackstone as Co-Head of BAAM alongside John McCormick. Joe is a world-class talent with proven experience investing and managing risk. In his seven years at Brown, the University ranked number one amongst peers on one-year, three-year, five-year, and seven-year returns and achieved the highest Sharpe ratio of any major U.S. endowment driven in large part by their successful hedge fund investment program.

Joe's leadership will be a major asset to BAAM as we continue to expand into new areas. Our Secondaries business remains one of the best positioned globally in a sector with huge tailwinds. SP's 2019 flagship fund is over 75% committed and we expect to start raising the successor later this year. We also continue to grow adjacencies like infrastructure and real estate secondaries. And we recently launched a new strategy investing alongside GPs in high-quality assets that they want to continue to own beyond their initial fund term.

Finally in insurance, we just announced the acquisition of a life insurance and annuity company from Allstate with $28 billion of long-duration assets. The acquisition will be completed through a new Blackstone managed vehicle of approximately $2 billion, and our Insurance Solutions team will act as the Asset Manager, bringing the firm's pro forma insurance AUM to nearly $100 billion. Given insurance need for better returns and our direct credit origination capabilities, we expect to do more in this sector in support of their policyholders moving forward. In summary, every business at the firm has terrific growth prospects that we're executing against, we remain extremely confident in the path forward.

And with that I turn things over to Michael.

Michael Chae{BIO 4440455 <GO>}
Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter represented a remarkable finish to the year, as we achieved record results in nearly every metric, distributable earnings, fee-related earnings, AUM, realizations, deployment and total fund depreciation. We also reported our fifth-best quarter for inflows. This broad-based success in the same year as one of the most severe market declines on record is a powerful illustration of the all-weather durability of our business model.

Starting with results. Fee-earning AUM increased 15% year-over-year to $469 billion, while total AUM rose 8% to $619 billion, driven by robust gross inflows of $95 billion for the year, and despite $43 billion of realizations. The strength of inflows in 2020, despite not raising any of our largest flagship funds during the year, highlights the firm's expansive breadth of product offerings and the ongoing shift toward perpetual capital, indeed over a quarter of the firm's fee-earning AUM is now perpetual.

Fee-related earnings rose 33% in 2020 to $2.4 billion, or $1.97 per share as Steve highlighted, driven by continued strong growth in fee revenues coupled with significant margin expansion. Management fees increased 18% to $4.1 billion for the year and are up 35% over the past two years, powered by our flagship fundraising and a doubling of the real estate Core+ platform in the last two years. BREIT [ph] alone increased its AUM by 71% in 2020, and generated strong gross appreciation of 9% for the firm, despite the environment.

In terms of margins. The firm's overall FRE margin expanded over 400 basis points in 2020 to 52.8%, the highest level ever for an annual period. Distributable earnings for the full year rose 16% to $3.3 billion. For the fourth quarter, DE increased 60% to $1.5 billion, or $1.13 per share underpinned by sharp growth in FRE and a doubling of net realizations to $897 million. In addition to strong fund realizations most advanced liquid strategies crystallize incentive fees annually

In the fourth quarter. BAAM's strong finish to the year in terms of investment performance with a 5.6% gross composite return in the quarter, as well as the growing contribution of these direct investing strategies generated a 57% increase in the segments realized performance revenues to $171 million.

Turning to investment performance. It was another excellent quarter for the firm across the board with record total fund depreciation of $31 billion in the quarter. As Jon highlighted, we continue to see the benefit at favorable sector and asset selection in our funds, against a backdrop of rising global equity and credit markets. In real estate, the breadth opportunistic funds appreciated 4.3% in the quarter, while the Core+ funds appreciated 5.5%. As has been the case, since the start of the pandemic, the vast majority of the real estate portfolio is demonstrating fundamental strength, particularly our holdings and logistics, suburban multifamily and life sciences office. Despite headwinds in certain more affected sectors, the BREP funds appreciated 3.4% for the full year and the Core+ funds appreciated 7.9%, as compared to a 7.6% decline for the public REIT index.

In private equity, the corporate PE and Tac Opps funds appreciated 10.6% and 11.3%, respectively in the fourth quarter, marking the third consecutive quarter of double-digit appreciation for both platforms. Strength was broad-based across both the private and public portfolio led by our technology and consumer finance holdings. For the full year, the corporate PE funds appreciated 11.9%, while Tac Opps appreciated 14.1%. Life-to-date returns for the most recent vintages of the Corporate Private Equity and Tac Opps funds remains outstanding.

The Secondaries funds, which report on a two-quarter lag started to recognize the benefit of last year's market recovery in their fourth quarter returns appreciating 9.4%. We expect strong performance to continue over the coming quarters given the direction of the markets in the second half of 2020. And in credit and hedge fund solutions, we saw healthy appreciation again in the fourth quarter, including a 4.6% gross return for the credit composite. Strong investment performance across the firm generated $1.2 billion of Net Accrued Performance Revenues in the quarter and lifted the balance sheet receivable to $3.8 billion, up 8% sequentially, notwithstanding nearly $1 billion of net realized distributions. At the same time the firm's invested performance revenue eligible AUM increased to a record $294 billion, up 18% year-over-year. These are both important indicators of future value.

One last topic of note. 10 years ago, Blackstone made a strategic minority investment in the Brazil-based alternatives manager, Patria, the team we had known for many years. Last week, Patria completed a highly oversubscribed initial public offering, marking their transition to a valuable public company and a successful investment for Blackstone. While we partly monetize our stake in the offering, we remain a continuing shareholder.

In closing, the firm's 2020 performance exemplify the power of Blackstone's extraordinary business model, resiliency and staying power during the market dislocation and the ability to deliver record results in the fourth quarter across almost every metric in the context of the market recovery. Looking forward, we continue to scale existing businesses, while also expanding into new areas with deep addressable market opportunities for the firm. The outlook for robust high-quality growth over the long-term is strong. And we believe the future for Blackstone is very bright.

With that, we thank you for joining the call. I would like to open it up now for questions.

Weston Tucker{BIO 17237570 <GO>}
Great. And Leslie, before you queue for questions, if I could just remind all the analysts, we have a fairly long queue here. If you can please limit your questions, just one question initially, and then if you have a follow-up, please re-enter the queue. Back to you, Leslie.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Okay. Thank you, everyone. Your question-and-answer session will now begin. (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs. You are now live in the call, Alexander, please go ahead.

Q - Alexander Blostein{BIO 15412167 <GO>}
Right. Great. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Why don't we start with insurance. I guess in light of the Allstate acquisition announced last night. Maybe you guys could comment on your bigger picture aspirations for the Insurance segment. Obviously you made several -- several hires there recently. Should we expect more deals like this one, I guess over the coming quarters and years, or is Allstate meant to be sort of the platform to build off of?

And then secondly, if you could comment on the economics as well, so that the fee rate on the assets and how you expect that to evolve as well as the funding structure. It sounded like the majority of the purchase obviously comes off the balance sheet, right. So $2 billion, I think you said is third-party capital relative to a $2.8 billion purchase price out. A few questions there, but maybe we can try to hit all of them. Thank you.

A - Stephen A. Schwarzman{BIO 1404170 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks, Alex. I'll start with the big picture. And what's driving what you're seeing us do and a number of firms in our industry is the extremely low level of interest rates out there, which is creating the need for greater returns for insurance company assets and particularly the ability to have direct origination capabilities. So our ability to originate corporate debt, structured debt, real estate debt is quite important and we think gives us a real strength in this area to line up our insurance Solutions business with insurance balance sheet. So this is an area we've had success with Fidelity Guarantee. We've said on these calls. This is something we intend to do more of. It's an area of focus. We're obviously hiring a number of people to help build out this business and capability.

Exactly the form it will take. I think each of these transactions may look and feel a little different. The underlying sort of path here is the same the idea of us managing these assets, driving the returns higher, which ultimately helps the policyholders. I think all of that is key. On this particular transaction, and Michael can fill in the blanks. But the $2.8 billion, there are flows related to the transaction plus a bit of debt. So the ultimate check size here is a little less than $2 billion of equity. It's more of a typical GP LP setup, I would say, but we are putting in some capital, single digit percentage of the total capital needed. So this is really a third party situation where we're managing capital and our compensation will come from managing the assets along the lines of what we've done with Fidelity Guarantee.

A - Weston Tucker{BIO 17237570 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Alex.

Okay. Thank you. The next question comes from Sumeet Mody from Piper Sandler. You are live in the call, please go ahead.

Q - Sumeet Mody{BIO 19736527 <GO>}
Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Just sort of a high-level question here. Creating these new dedicated funds across growing sectors like life sciences and growth equity. Some of these flagship funds, the reasons are now behind you. The global growth seemingly is concentrated here to areas like technology and health care. When you're creating these dedicated fund in some of these areas like you're doing now and down the road, is it kind of crowd out some of these deployment opportunities to the flagship funds, or is there just kind of generally a lot of opportunities out there for global private equity funds to take advantage of or kind of along with some of the newer dedicated funds?

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
It's a good question. I would say, it does not crowd out our dedicated funds, our traditional large-scale private equity funds. And the reason is the mandates here are very different. So if you look at the two funds to focus on, let's talk about Blackstone Life Sciences. It's mission is to invest primarily in Phase III trial drugs, something that we would not do in our private equity business have never done before. And so it's a completely new area. It may invest in companies, but again it's based on drugs that we're waiting for FDA approval. This is not something we would do in our private equity business.

In the growth equity business, we're taking minority stakes with founders, which is, of course, is very different than our private equity model, which is based on control and being able to intervene in these businesses. In our growth equity area we're looking to partner and help these young companies generally working with founders again a very different model. And then some of our other more geographic strategies are similar to what we've done in the past and where we've raised energy or Asia or other funds. And we keep a portion of that in the main funds, but we -- by expanding with the new front, we don't have a over-concentration in the main fund in a particular geography or sector.

So we're super sensitive to our flagship funds, delivering an real estate private equity and corporate private equity is what we built the business on and we want to continue to deliver for those investors. There just happens to be a lot of white space, new areas to go into that we as a firm had not historically been in.

Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys. You are live in the call. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Cyprys{BIO 16672489 <GO>}
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just looking at the dry powder levels here about $147 billion, look fairly high here and certainly similar levels a year ago too. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you're expanding your capacity to generate new investment ideas and expanding the capacity to put capital to work, particularly in size and with the new insurance business or expansion of the insurance business that you'll be getting more assets. I guess what new sourcing and origination capabilities are you thinking about adding or might be able to add?

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
Well, the good news here is, we just have a much broader base of capital today, achieving the highest return strategies, involves a smaller universe potentially of investable assets. As you raise particularly some of this perpetual capital, longer duration, lower-yielding, you can look at a much broader view. So yes, we're investing in origination capabilities, in particularly, in our credit area and corporate and real estate and structured credit, but also in our equity investing as we move into core private equity or the real estate Core+ business. We're just hiring more people in these areas. It gives us more dialog.

But oftentimes, you're not necessarily using real estate as an example looking for an empty building or distressed situation. You're just buying a leased apartment project that's high quality you want to own in a reasonable return. So this newer cost of capital enables us to sort of widen the funnel. Then you take our existing team you add more people. And it actually makes our regional businesses even better because we're in more dialog with more sellers, more brokers, more investment bankers. We're just part of the flow and there's really been a real benefit from expanding our platforms.

And if you think about it on the credit side, as well, if you go -- went in there and you only had the ability to do higher returning mezzanine, you would only have one discussion, but if you can go in there today and you have a wide variety of capital with different durations, lower loan to values, longer duration insurance capital, and what we're getting from our direct lending platform, we have a much more robust discussion. And so we're finding the ability to deploy more capital given the range of places, given the opportunities and yes, to your question, we have to build the organization to meet these needs.

Operator
Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty from UBS. You are live in the call. Please go ahead.

Q - Adam Beatty{BIO 16011804 <GO>}
Hi, thank you, and good morning. I want to ask about the wealth management channel, given the success of BREIT, and promising start to BCRED. In terms of distribution, which sub-segments in the wealth channel, do you find attractive? And what kind of resources on the distribution side are you planning towards that? Also maybe what product adjacencies might be attractive at this point? Thank you.

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
What I'd say about retail is, we had a big event here. We had a modest celebration crossing a $100 billion of AUM. Joan Solotar and her team have done a terrific job. And it's a mix of the episodic funds that we still distribute. That's generally targeted to the highest net worth investors. As we move into these perpetual capital vehicles BCRED and BREIT, which you have elements of liquidity to them that are favorable to customers. They come down in terms of the availability and it expands the universe of potential customers who can invest. I would say in distribution, we're trying to really cover the waterfront. It's -- we're talking in the United States, in Europe, in Asia we're raising money broadly. It's obviously the largest distribution firms. It's a private banks around the world. It's the IBD channel. It's really broad-based.

And what investors are seeking is, obviously higher return. They want more yield. They're looking for things done at Blackstone quality. And we're focused on the fees we charge being quite reasonable, that, that we're looking for the customers to have a great experience. And I think historically in private assets, in distributed to retail, there was a bias, I guess to try to make short-term money and not necessarily deliver a great customer experience. What we're trying to do here is give individual investors the same experience that our institutional investors have. The products may look and feel a little different, but the goal is exactly the same. Obviously, the markets are reacting positively. Investors are -- the strength of the brand here is very differentiated. And that's why we have so much confidence here in the potential of this.

And we said BREIT could grow to be the largest product. BCRED has very good momentum, out of the box given people's desire for yield. I think some of these products will be able to move geographically where you raise money in different parts of the world. There is more we can do, we're not ready to announce anything, but what I'd say is, our bias is not necessarily to create a massive number of products, but a smaller number of very large products that can scale. And BREIT getting over $20 billion was another big achievement for us. So as you can tell, we're spending a lot of time in this area. It continues to grow the perpetual capital. And we expect good things from retail in 2021.

Great answer. I appreciate it. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. You are live in the call. Craig, please go ahead.

Q - Craig Siegenthaler{BIO 15021209 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone.

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
Hi, Craig.

Q - Craig Siegenthaler{BIO 15021209 <GO>}
For my question, I wanted to hit on Blackstone's ability to expand into newer geographies including in Asia and South America. And specifically what are the major economies in marketing white space around the globe today, where Blackstone is either not present, or is significantly sub-scale. And what is Blackstone's appetite to expand into these geographies either through M&A, or organically over the next few years?

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
Well, as you know, we definitely have a global business. I would put Asia at the top of the list, given the scale of the economies there. China and India, both have more than 1 billion people. And what you see there in China, in particular, is an economy that's growing very rapidly, will grow to be the largest economy in the world at some point in the future. I think there is an opportunity over time for us to offer products that our RMB-based that would be something that could happen over time and that could be very large scale. I think we can do more in countries like Japan, which may not be fast growing, but there is a strong desire for returns from individual investors and institutions. And India frankly has been our greatest strength in Asia, where we've deployed a lot of capital in both private equity and real estate and that economy is still early days.

I would say as a caveat, that smaller economies for us are a little more challenging given the scale of capital we operate at, so and more less developed economies. We -- I would say our results in places like South America and in Africa, which have been small, is very small as a percentage of what we do have been a little more mix. There could be opportunities in those markets over time, but I think in terms of geographic growth, I would say, Asia and the big economies in Asia are the most interesting. And then I would say that Europe, despite its slow growth, aggregately its the largest economy in the world, if you put all those countries together. There are fewer competitors there. And there are more of our products that we can distribute there both raising money, but also deploying capital in Europe, for Europe.

So when I look at one of our great strengths of the firm, it's that we're a global business. And so if one market around the world gets too hot, we can deploy capital elsewhere customers around the world are facing the same challenges, which is they need higher returns and they want a trusted pair of hands who takes a long-term approach and that's what Blackstone represent. So when we look, yes, there's opportunity in retail, there's opportunity in insurance and there's certainly opportunities outside the United States.

Q - Glenn Schorr{BIO 1881019 <GO>}
Thanks very much. So curious to hear your expanded thoughts on the stock market not from the humongous growth necessary that we've seen, but they have at minimum several hundred billion of buying power. And so I think of them as best friends where they could be on the lookout to purchase some of your assets. And as far away they're competing against some of the same properties you go after. So just curious to get your thoughts on that environment? Thanks.

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
Well, I think the SPAC market, and I commented earlier this morning on TV about this. I think it's a good development long term to open up access to capital to public companies. We've seen a reduction in the number of public companies by 50% over the last 25 years, and the SPACs have led to the highest number of IPOs in more than 20 years now. So I think that's positive. Now that being said, I think there are challenges around alignment of interest, when sponsors earn their economics, what the size of those economics are. And I think some of that will change over time. As it relates to our business, we've announced, I think, three SPAC sales in the last few months. I think these will all be very good public companies. These are good executions. And so it's helpful for us on the liquidity front.

But I do think it's fair to say for smaller sized businesses, in most cases, it gets a little more competitive with this SPAC money. The good news is we tend to operate, particularly in private equity at large scale. So there's not many SPACs can do the type of deals we do. And I would also say not every company wants to go public. Certainly, faster growing companies may want capital to grow. They're not ready to go public. Other businesses may not be. So it's requires a certain type of company, a certain type of exit and tends to be a bit on the smaller side. So overall, for capital markets, as I said, I think it's a positive. I think there will be some changes in reforms over time to make it even better.

Q - Kenneth Worthington{BIO 3303320 <GO>}
Hi, good morning. With the new administration and one with an aligned White House and Congress, what is top of mind in terms of implications and opportunities here for Blackstone in private markets investing?

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
So in terms of implications, there could be a variety. It's obviously, early. It's possible, we could see higher corporate taxes, which would impact the entire corporate landscape. We could see more regulatory activity. On the flip side, I think some sectors where we are active investors could really benefit. I think you could see environmental and sustainability areas get a boost. We're doing a lot in that space across energy and energy credit. We could see more dollars into infrastructure, in the area, we have an underwritten a lot of corporate activity or government activity, that could change with a big push by the government.

And then I think one of the benefits people may not focus on is in the line government here could push more dollars to places like New York and San Francisco, hard-hit urban areas during the COVID period. And that would be beneficial for some of the real estate properties we own, because those areas are under pressure. So I think there's a variety of things as a firm we've operated in all red, all blue environments, purple environment. And we take a long-term approach and we've been able to navigate those issues and those changes come up. We expect the same here as well.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Res. You are live in the call. Please go ahead.

Q - Patrick Davitt{BIO 15433277 <GO>}
Hey, good morning, everyone. So my sense from investors they tend to want to keep discount these big performance-related fees you put through fee earnings. So could you maybe frame or help us separate out how much the Fee Related Performance revenues in the fourth quarter was really kind of -- what you guys repeatable each year versus those that are maybe more episodic or based on kind of one-year type performance fees?

A - Michael Chae{BIO 4440455 <GO>}
Patrick, look, first of all, in terms of Fee Related Performance Revenues, as we talked about before, we think this is a super high-quality revenue stream. As you know it's derived from Perpetual Capital. It's paid on a recurring basis on contractual timetables, well known and without having dispose underlying assets. So, we think it's very much in line with the overall quality picture of FRE. And you've seen it scaling, right, as we've sort of predicted in the last few years. And you saw that step-up again.

In terms of the composition of it, right now the majority, the strong majority of the total annual amount is from the Core+ platform. And of that, BREIT is really the dominant portion of that. And that as you know is, it's recurring its annual, it's in the fourth quarter. And as that platform grows -- and it grew 70% as we said year-over-year. The fees will continue to scale both management fees and Fee Related Performance Revenues. A smaller portion of that was from the BPP platform. Those are specific to investments that occur on it on a several year basis, three years, four years, five years. And that occurred during the year both in the third quarter and the fourth quarter.

And then you're also seeing a smaller amount, but that over the long-term, it will scale from our direct lending platform, both our BDC and also going forward BCRED, our non-traded BDC. So it's a --it's sort of a portfolio of different products. Core+ is the biggest part, but not the only part. And BREIT is the biggest part within Core+ and that is, to your question, an annual occurrence.

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
In the key distinction, Michael, is that we don't have to sell assets to generate these fees. That's the key distinction of what ends up in the effort.

A - Michael Chae{BIO 4440455 <GO>}
That's right. And as we talked about, this is not a new thing, in terms I mentioned BDCs, the incentive fee portion of that income and yield in products like that have been -- I think for a long time considered very much part of -- the sort of metric.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.

Q - Devin Ryan{BIO 5863151 <GO>}
Great, thank you. Good morning. I have a question just on the FRE margin. Obviously saw some, some really nice expansion in 2020 over 400 basis points, you had very strong fee growth. But also the OpEx was decently below the prior couple of year average growth, which we appreciate especially given the lower T&E from the pandemic. So I'm just trying to think about some of the moving parts. As we look forward, the expectation for the FRE margin from here is, maybe some of those pandemic savings were reversed. And just more broadly how we should think about the FRE margin and T&E and some of the costs that may come back into the system in 2021?

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
Devin, thank you for the question. Look, the short answer is stepping back on margins, and it was a terrific year on that front. Is our margins are up, significantly, because of strong operating leverage. Revenues currently well in excess of expenses, I know that's sort of a truism. And you can particularly see that in our Real Estate segment and which was really the biggest driver, where fee revenues were up over 30% with operating expenses, total operating expenses up 15%. And that's why you can do the math. Overall, the Real Estate segment accounted for around three quarters of the overall margin expansion from a business unit breakdown perspective.

As you mentioned, as we've talked about previously, as with almost every other business, 2020 did benefit from a substantial reduction in T&E spending. And that to help me out here accounted for around, call it 100 basis points of that 440 basis point margin expansion. So look, as we look ahead to 2021, all of us, of course are waiting for normalization sooner rather than later, so -- and such that the T&E dynamic would reverse, but notwithstanding that, even adjusting for that we still expect strength in margins. So that's hopefully will help you on just to put in context the COVID component of that expansion.

Q - Devin Ryan{BIO 5863151 <GO>}

Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Carrier from Bank of America. You are live in the call. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Carrier{BIO 7543391 <GO>}
Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I mean, you guys have had great success in the perpetual vehicles, which obviously provide good visibility and growth in FRE. But it also threw up a lot of performance fees, assuming that was just BREIT in the fourth quarter having a strong rebound, which is longer-term. But can you put some context on the type of the year, maybe 2020 was -- versus the potential you see for that type of earnings stream, since it's still fairly new. And then housing products like BCRED contribute to it longer term. Thanks a lot.

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
Sure, Mike. And I think this takes up a bit on, I think Patrick's question as well. I think the simple answer, and it's a good one, is that, over time, those -- the growth in those Fee Related Performance Revenues will basically be aligned with the growth in our Perpetual Capital strategies, with again real estate Core+ being a huge portion of that right now, but also as you mentioned in that direct lending area, scaling of that source of performance revenues as well over time. So that sort of both in the short and long run is kind of the r-squared on this; growth in perpetual, growth in core-plus, growth in direct lending, equals over time, growth in those Fee-Related Performance Revenues and that is a meaningful tailwind.

A - Michael Chae{BIO 4440455 <GO>}
And I would just add that the, the fact that you don't have to sell assets, as we mentioned is important. The preferred returns in these vehicles tends to be materially lower because they're lower targeted returns. And just as we grow more assets in this space have more vehicles. This should be a steady source of the income for a long time to come.

Q - Michael Carrier{BIO 7543391 <GO>}

Q - Robert Lee{BIO 22645121 <GO>}
Thank you so much. Just on hedge fund solutions on BAAM, in understanding the performance has been good. You have the new Co-leader of the unit, growth there has been kind of the challenge, kind of, I guess more stable. How do you see growth of that business progressively. You see any signs that there is maybe increased demand for more liquid strategies given how the markets have run up late, or what can you do to kind of reinvigorate [ph] growth in that business?

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
We think that business has tremendous potential. The low rate environment, obviously has investors looking for other liquid alternatives, where they can get returns. And then the run-up in the stock market has investors looking for places to put capital where there is some downside protection. And both of those factors lead you, I think to our hedge fund solutions business. With the addition of Joe Dowling, teaming up with John McCormick, I think that puts us in a really good place. Joe's track record has been excellent. We are going to be looking to try to drive the returns higher in that space. Joe was outstanding at Brown, finding leading cutting-edge managers, looking at where the economy is transforming, either geographically in some of the fastest-growing sectors as well. And

We expect we'll do the same here. And as the returns continue to improve or improve, we think we'll see more flows. So our hedge fund solutions business, which has flattened off in terms of AUM, but is actually improved on profitability. Michael can comment on that. I think you growing AUM and become a growth engine at the end for our firm.

A - Michael Chae{BIO 4440455 <GO>}
And I just add to that, I mean putting some financial surround that. First, as Jon said, while AUM was somewhat down this year, revenues were up 7% on the AUM side outflows were actually in line with 2019, and maybe not surprisingly inflows, slowed somewhat in the wake of the March, April volatility. But revenues were up, which reflects the business mix shift towards higher fee strategies both within BPS and also in the direct investing area and as a result, you can actually see the fourth quarter management fee rate was actually up 8 basis points year-over-year.

So that's sort of unit economics are I think are improving and its funny for a business that's been in our hands for 20 years, we never been more excited about the potential. As John said, in the context of the rate environment fixed income markets. The search for sort of absolute return replacements with some more upside is deep and our platform with its scale and its reach and its access to the best managers doing things with them allocating capital, as well as the flow within our firm and the IP those things combined along now with additional leadership alongside John with Joe Dowling were super excited.

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
So what I'd say is, if you look at our firm over 35 years, our governance structure has served our LPs, really well our employees and for the last 13 years, 14 years our shareholders. So we're really comfortable with it. We're always looking at ways to maximize value for shareholders. We did that in the context of the C Corp conversion, but we're very deliberate in how we do things. But I would say generally the idea of taking a long-term approach in the management, in the firm, how we're structured today. We feel good about that. It's delivered for us in the past. We think it will deliver for us in the future.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer Company. You are live in the call. Please go ahead.

Q - Chris Kotowski{BIO 1507062 <GO>}
Yeah. Good morning, and thank you. I guess, I thought the BioMed transaction was really interesting. And a couple of narrow questions about that. One is, I'm wondering did it all end up in BPP Life Sciences, or was it distributed among a number of different vehicles. And then secondly, what is, I guess the long-term vision, our ambition for BPP Life Sciences. And then I guess the more broad question I have is, over time as you've developed more and more of these permanent, or a very long-dated capital structures, should we see your strategy and the opportunistic funds kind of more from the "Buy It, Fix It, Sell It" to the Buy It, Fix It, move it into a permanent capital vehicle, should we see a lot more of that?

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
So there are a number of questions here. Let me go through each one. The first one, I want to back up I guess for a second and just say that the genesis for this transaction was a number of our investors in the BREP 8 fund wanted to continue to own this. And that really what was -- was the catalyst. And more than 70% of the capital in the BPP Life Sciences vehicle came from the existing investors. So I think because they were so enthused about this. It made a lot of sense for us. Where that -- where it ended up, the vast majority of the capital did come from this new vehicle. We put some of it into our general BPP fund, based on some available capital, but the vast majority ended up in BPP Life Sciences. No surprise, our investors are excited about this new vehicle. I think we'll raise additional capital beyond the $8.4 billion, we talked about. There is a potential for this to grow to be again quite large. We announced the deal shortly after the initial recapitalization, which I mentioned where we did a $3.4 billion deal of additional properties in Cambridge, the heart of Life Sciences making us the largest owner in Cambridge, which we think is important strategically. So this is a business that has the potential to grow not only in Cambridge, but in South San Francisco, in San Diego, Cambridge, UK, where the business is focused.

In terms of ambition, I guess we've hit that. I think this is an area that has real growth given the tailwinds we see in Life Sciences. One of the things we don't often talk about on these calls is the power of the overall platform. So the fact that we have Blackstone Life Sciences gives us more confidence here in BioMed. It allows us to do the Cryoport investment in Tac Opps in frozen logistics. It allows us to do Precision Medicine, which is a company that commercializes and does once the trial for life science companies was one of our largest investments in private equity in the fourth quarter. So we are really building a powerful life science ecosystem here at Blackstone and BPP Life Sciences will be a big part of it. Nick Galakatos, who runs our Life Sciences business is actually going to be on the Board at the BioMed Life Sciences funds.

In terms of our opportunistic business, no, I don't believe this will be the way, the vast majority or whatever of deals will be sold. There was a pretty unique set of circumstances. There may be other situations, but I think it will be the exception. In this case, the scale argued forward. We also ran a process, a competitive dynamic brought in outside firms, had a go-shop period. We want to make sure, the most important thing to us is fiduciaries, is maximizing the return in our private equity and real estate private equity funds. So I think this is a little bit of a unique situation. We had a great process to back-to-values. And long term now we have a bunch of investors excited about this area and a new vehicle that I think will grow in scale.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Arnaud Giblat from BNP. You are live in the call. Please go ahead.

Q - Arnaud Giblat{BIO 15145619 <GO>}
Hi, good morning. I had a question on capital deployment. It's been very strong in Q4, even if you exclude the capital going into the new perpetual capital vehicles. How much of this is a function of good market condition or should -- and how much is a function of just being able to catch up on deals that were identified earlier in the year and where you are not able to execute on that. And if you could also elaborate on, in terms of the outlook for capital deployment in the quarters [ph] to come? Thank you.

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
Yeah. So I think the biggest factor, obviously, deal activity in deployment was slow coming off of March for the next couple of quarters and so we saw a resumption. I think so, again given the expansion of the firm, if you look at our Secondaries business now, where we have large-scale private equity Secondaries, real estate Secondaries, infrastructure, we're deploying more capital. If you look in private equity, regular way Corporate Private Equity, a larger scale fund. Our Asia business is growing. Our core private equity vehicle grew from $5 billion to $8 billion in the latest generation. And you can look across the firm and then the expansion in these perpetual vehicles we keep talking about, of course, leads to the need for greater capital deployment. So I think a big portion of this is just a function of the engines are -- there are many more of them and they're larger and that's leading to more deployment.

I also think, we have some sectors. We have high conviction around. We're spending a lot of time on some of the COVID impacted businesses, travel-related, location-based entertainment, hotels. I think we'll see more activity in some of those areas. And then these big secular themes around digitalization, Life Sciences, what's happening in green energy. Those areas, I think will attract a lot of capital. And we'll continue to invest in Europe, in Asia, and around the globe. So this quarter was particularly active because of the large Life Sciences transaction. But when you looked overall for the year 2020, I think it's $62 billion [ph] was basically the same, as it was in 2019. So I think that indicates, it's likely that deployment probably grows over time, or will grow over time, just given the scale of our overall business.

Q - Gerald O'Hara
Great. Thanks. Maybe one more on insurance initiative. Clearly, a well-documented, total addressable market of material side. But also increasingly more buyers in the market. So perhaps you could speak to the competitive dynamics, you saw during the Allstate process. or just even more generally? Thank you.

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
Well, we're not -- obviously, we're not talking about particular transactions, but I would -- can see that the space has gotten more competitive over the last few years. I think our advantage is one, the scale we can do things at; and two, our origination capabilities I think are pretty unique. And I think give us an advantage in this space for counterparties who want to work with us. So we like where we sit today. But I do think it's important to keep in mind beyond actually just our capabilities, our brand resonates. So, if you're an insurance company and you're thinking about putting your liabilities in somebody else's hands, you really want to know who that is. And so the scale of Blackstone, our reputation as a fiduciary helps us. And so, yes, like in all things, there is more competition, but we like our positioning, we think there is an opportunity to really grow there.

Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Shutler from William Blair. You are live in the call. Please go ahead.

Q - Christopher Shutler{BIO 16587972 <GO>}
Thanks. Good morning, everybody. In the Strategic Partners business, I know you're going to be raising a new fund there. I think last time I checked, Secondaries transaction volume across the market was something like 2% or 2.5% of total Private Equity now, where do you think that percentage can go over the next handful of years and why?

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
Well, I think two things are going to help the Secondaries business; one, really importantly is that the denominator is going to grow, even if the penetration doesn't grow, I'll come back to that in a moment, but alternatives are growing at high single-digits, low double digits across the globe. And by definition that means there is a bigger addressable market, people change their investment strategies, are unhappy with managers, they want to get out of certain spaces. And so as if you believe in the alternative sort of megatrend, which we certainly do, Secondaries is a powerful way to play it.

And then as a percentage, I just think 2% of a market trading is not a sign of a market that has sufficient liquidity. And so I think that will lead to higher percentages. This is a business that's grown for us. I don't know eight-fold or something, since we took it on, five years or six years ago. I think it's a business that can continue to grow at a very rapid rate. Verdun Perry and his team have done an outstanding job. The returns have been excellent. We said in here that we'll raise our ninth Private Equity Secondaries fund. We talked about moving into the continuation area. We're having success in real estate and infrastructure. I think as alternatives grow, this fund continues to grow. This area is a firm continues to grow. And I don't think we're anywhere sort of near the end for Secondaries, in terms of growth.

Q - Brian Bedell{BIO 3462988 <GO>}
Great. Thanks very much. Most of my questions have been answered very, very comprehensive answers. Maybe just one on the retail side. As you said, Jon, you've seen great momentum in that. Just maybe sort of the outlook over the next one to two or maybe even three years, whether you think that growth can accelerate given your distribution initiatives in the wealth management space and especially the demand for your products on the retail side. And if you can sprinkle in comments on sustainable investing in your ESG, and if it is, whether you're seeing the stronger demand for ESG solutions within your products?

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
I would just echo my earlier comments that, that retail remains a very favorable channel for us given the brand and the range of products now. The movement from beyond just the episodic products, which are obviously continue to be offered to the highest network people, but the BREITs and BCREDs, their distribution capabilities, the ability to sell those broadly is powerful. And I would just point out BREIT, it took a number of years to sort of get to lift off momentum. It feels like BCRED in the early days is having more success because we've opened up those channels and we're broadening the number of channels. And so I think as we introduce new products in this area, they can continue to grow and have this success. And this is all part of this sort of growth in Perpetual Capital growth, ultimately of course in fee-related earnings and bringing this sort of world-class service and investment discipline to individual investors. We think that trend will certainly continue and we're at the vanguard of that trend.

As it relates to ESG, I think there is opportunity there. I think there is more opportunity, we talk about it internally. I think there is opportunity both institutionally and individual investors. Going back to one of the earlier questions, we just have to make sure we set it up in a lane that is very defined, and in a separate area where we can deliver for the individual investors and do something separate and different than we do in some of our other funds. But I think over time we'll develop some products in that area.

Q - Sumeet Mody{BIO 19736527 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had a follow-up on the Allstate Life acquisition, it looks like the funds are purchasing about 80% of the life and annuity business, just leaving about $5 billion of GAAP reserves in the New York, ALNY on the table. Just it seems like they intend to sell that as well. Just curious, if you could talk about what went into the decision to not acquire that portion of assets as well?

A - Jonathan Gray{BIO 5170766 <GO>}
Well, we make decisions about, which jurisdictions and so forth make the most sense for us. And we're obviously engaged in discussions with the seller on what maximizes value for them. And in this particular transaction that's how we landed on this. We ended up buying the vast majority of the assets and that worked for Allstate. I would say, I think Tom Wilson, the CEO has done a terrific job here pivoting his company, I mean getting him focused on higher-growth businesses. And this was something that made a lot of sense for us and our investors. So we looked at, it is a real win-win.
