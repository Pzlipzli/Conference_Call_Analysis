Clearly, in today's environment, the cost of doing business has gone up. And, so, we are doing everything we can to manage and mitigate that to remain competitive from -- typically, we have one or two points of price erosion. We've actually been commanding price mix realization in today's environment through supply chain efficiencies, admin efficiencies, and some price mix realization. We do see some of the downsides in China from VBP that we're weathering through those and earning some of those tenders, going forward.

And they just have a really maniacal focus is what I would say on competitiveness and customer centricity. When we -- and Jo alluded to this, Larry -- if you look at -- I'll go around the world a little bit -- we are seeing procedures recovering. I think we're benefiting that, posting very strong September but also a quarter end of 8%. In the United States, we started to see surgical procedures tick up. Predominantly, it did at the latter part of the quarter. We do see diagnostic procedures more in the mid single digits, so colonoscopies as an example in quarter three. So, we're expecting that to continue. Now, you'll recall that we're anniversarying Omnicron hitting kind of in the Thanksgiving time frame in December, so that should be a healthy comp, but we also expect in a very focused micro surgeons in the winter surge. Europe is recovering nicely. August was a little bit of a slowdown, given the holiday season, but really September picked up. Asia is in fast recovery, I would say, in India and Japan. And China is still -- quarter three recovered nicely versus quarter two, but they're still below pre-COVID levels. So, we expect that bolus to continue. We are moving forward. We have a strong position in China. We have a very diversified position in China. We are moving through some of the VBP actions. That's what you saw in our Joints business. We were actually up 10% in our Knees and our Hips in the United States, but we had negative growth in the quarter, really due to the volume-based procurement wins on pricing actions that we'll come through that for next year. So, thank you for the question, Larry.",

    "text": "Yeah, Larry, regarding M&A, well, first off, let me start with the -- just reiterating the strong free cash flow that we have year-to-date, over $13 billion, also very proud of the fact that we've been able to distribute nearly $11 billion to shareholders through the form of our dividend program as well as the repurchase program that was announced just mid last month. So, we feel really good on that front. But, as you likely noticed in today's comments, we still hold $34 billion of cash, which positions us extremely well to continue exercising that lever of capital allocation around acquisitions or significant collaborations, going forward. So, our priorities have not changed. In fact, maybe we're even a little bit more bullish and eager to do something. But, as folks come to know us, we're not going to do anything haphazardly. We're not -- The aspect of this company that is really enjoyable as being the CFO is we don't have to do anything out of desperation. We're going to find those assets that have a great strategic fit and then make sense from a financial perspective with respect to returning to shareholders something that compensates them for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. The market is a little bit funny. The volatility actually doesn't help for a conducive M&A environment right now, because you have sellers, potential sellers holding on to 52-week highs or all-time highs, which, quite frankly, aren't too distant in the rearview mirror. We're going to approach it with a very fundamental discounted cash flow analysis to make sure we're bringing value forward. But the short answer to your question is our priorities have not changed. We're looking to complement the already strong portfolio you heard in the first round of responses.",

    "text": "Hi, Louise. Thanks so much for the question. So, the projections that we gave you about the $60 billion in revenue by 2025 really is all based on our current portfolio and our current pipeline. So, that doesn't have anything factored in right now in terms of M&A. Anything that we did there we would look at to be additive. When we take a look at how we're going to get there, we really believe we're going to have a compound annual growth rate of at least 5%, with growth in every year, and that includes through the STELARA LOE. We think we've got eight key brands that will be able to post double-digit growth through 2025. And, as we take a look through our pipeline and portfolio between now and then, 14 novel therapies filed with potential to exceed $1 billion, and we've got five of which we think actually have potential to exceed $5 billion; so, that's products like milvexian, which is in our partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb; amivantamab and lazertinib combination, which I mentioned for non-small cell lung cancer that we've got good data coming through; nipocalimab, which is progressing really nicely through the various stages of clinical development; that's the autoantibody asset that we've brought in from the Momenta acquisition. We have our TARIS platform that is progressing nicely for bladder cancer, and we have CARVYKTI. While we're still in the early stages of launching and ramping that asset, based on the strength of the data and the clinical trials, we remain really bullish on what CARVYKTI is going to mean for patients with multiple myeloma around the world. And, so, I think, based on our existing assets and the continued growth -- I mean, if you take a look at DARZALEX and the results that we just posted for the quarter, 39% growth, consistent with what we've been seeing, as well as growth in assets like TREMFYA, ERLEADA, etc., you take a look at the strength of the existing portfolio, you layer in on top of that on what's coming through with the pipeline, and that's what gives us the confidence to hit that $60 billion organically. That being said, in line with Jo, we're constantly looking for ways that we can continue to augment and further build our pipeline and to do so out of a position of strength. And, so, predominantly, we keep our innovation engine going, bringing in things in the earlier stages, which is usually our sweet spot because we can put our R&D machinery against it as well as our terrific regulatory and commercial and market access capabilities to really build things out. But that doesn't rule out later-stage acquisitions or in-market acquisitions as well.",

    "text": "Yeah. Thank you, Josh. I mean, I think -- Let me start with the macro. I think the health of the end-state markets in MedTech are quite vibrant. As we've talked, there's been bumpiness because of COVID that we're still having some of that. But there is patient demand that is still yet to be met. And that's really what we're experiencing in quarter three, and we still think that will continue into 2023. And you're seeing procedures that are more insulated like the cath lab is more protected in a hospital environment. Volumes have been going quite nicely. I have to give a huge shout-out to the BWI team in the US grew near-24% growth in quarter three. So -- And we're continuing to invest, to your point, in cardiology. We have a very active program in pulsed-field ablation, and we have a clinical trial in Europe that just completed in quarter two. We're looking at a 12-month readout of that on safety and efficacy and to file this year, and we're also in clinical trial in the United States for our pulsed-field ablation we enrolled in May 2022. We actually think the combos are going to be quite complementary of radio frequency, coupled with pulsed-field ablation. But -- So, that's a bit about the cath lab. We're seeing bariatric procedures, which are more elective in nature, really clearing through the backlog. The ones that tend to be laggers are things like Spine, and we're seeing cataract surgery at a certain point becomes less elective. And the pacesetters, if you will, are areas like Stroke, like Trauma that are much more less elective in nature. And then I would just say, from a creating patient demand, there's been a huge initiative on behalf of Johnson & Johnson and the industry to kind of move to site-of-care that patients are really preferring, and those areas like ambulatory surgery centers in the United States. Our team, predominantly in Joints as well as Sports -- they've grown market share 20% over the past two years in those emerging channels. In areas like Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in China, with a population of 1.4 billion patients, continue to grow and expand. So, we're going to see some of those shifts that happened during the pandemic really start to, I think, pick up, where patients can get a sense of comfort and hopefully we can kind of diffuse some of that, the scarcity of label into the right sites of care.",

    "text": "Yeah. No, thank you, Joanne. We always talk about BWI because it is a market leader, and yet the category still has very low penetration. Less than 12% of eligible patients are actually getting cardiac ablation. And we love this example, because we think, when we think of healthcare, we love to kind of intercept disease before it sets in. And, if you can go manage cardiac arhythmia through cardiac ablation, you can really prevent a stroke. So, just a huge acknowledgment of how close that team is to customers really around the world, how -- the innovation cadence, they really have many first-in-kind. And, if it's not first-in-kind, their second-generation will ultimately become the standard of care is what they've shown and just a true sense of competitiveness. So, in quarter three, BWI was up about 19%, Joanne, and, as I mentioned, about 24% in the US but 13% OUS, and very healthy growth in Europe, a very healthy growth in Asia. That is a category that, like Joints, is going to go through a bit of a VBP impact in some quarters to come, but we have very differentiated innovation, and we're building kind of local on-the-ground capability to endure through those. And, when I think about the state of innovation, it's just making sure that we can, from an industry penetration, take that from 12% penetration and double that. And that really is the single-minded focus of all of the innovation is to locate better lesions, deliver better lesion, make it a safer, less fluoro in the procedure, make it safer for electrophysiologists, and, quite frankly, scale it. There's a shortage of electrophysiologists. So, we invest a lot of money on market creation. Thank you, Joanne.",

So, if we start off with immunology, yes, I mean, the market will be experiencing a significant event, at least in the US, with some competitive biosimilars coming in against other assets. We do anticipate that that will cause a bit of disruption. But, when we take a look at our business and TREMFYA, so focusing on TREMFYA for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, I think, based on what this, as really the first IL-23, is delivering and delivering for patients, we can anticipate that there will still be strong continued growth for that asset. We're very, very confident in our access[ph] positions there and being able to retain that even in the face of biosimilars to other products that are launching. I'll also put in a plug while we're at it. I'm talking about TREMFYA, that we also feel really good about how our product TREMFYA is working through the Phase 3 clinical trials for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and look forward to hopefully getting that data in through the regulatory process and launching to bring even more benefit to patients with that. So, we do anticipate continued growth there. And then, on CARVYKTI, we're really pleased with how the product is performing for patients and the data that we're continuing to see. Maybe if I start off on CARTITUDE-4 and then I'll come back on the launch, we do anticipate CARTITUDE-4, hopefully reporting by year end, it's an event-driven trial. So, we have to wait until we have all of the events. But that's currently what we're planning for now, so that everyone knows CARTITUDE-4 is our study that takes a look at CARVYKTI in one to three prior lines of therapy. We're really interested and looking forward to seeing those results. So, if we take a look at the early launch for CARVYKTI, we've always talked about this being a really planned and thoughtful approach to scaling it. And, so, we're in the process right now. We've really been working closely with the centers where we had done the clinical trials to work through the initial phases. I know everyone knows about the worldwide lentivirus shortage. We've made really good progress on that and have good line of sight to that not being something that we're dependent, that not being a rate-limiting factor in the future. We're also working towards really being able to scale this at a broad level to be able to accommodate what we're seeing is both great demand for the product right now but also what we anticipate with CARTITUDE-4 as well as hopefully with CARTITUDE-5, which would be in frontline therapy. So, we reconfirm this as really a big asset with a lot of growth potential and one of our potentially $5-billion-plus brands.",

What I can say is that we do anticipate continued robust growth for TREMFYA. Next year, as I indicated, TREMFYA in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is really showing very strong market share gains and penetration in that market. STELARA really competes, and its strong growth has been in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And, so, when you take a look at those two markets, we do anticipate both of those continuing to show really good growth, at least through the first three quarters of next year, with STELARA then, post September, being impacted by biosimilars. And then, on nipocalimab, so I don't have really anything to share there yet for nipocalimab. Consistent with all of our processes, when we finish our studies, we go ahead and submit them to major medical meetings and get them published. I remain really confident in nipocalimab as an asset, and we've really taken a look at building that out across 10 or 11 different indications, including the potential for RA, which we think could be a big one. So, definitely more to come on that as we can share it.",
