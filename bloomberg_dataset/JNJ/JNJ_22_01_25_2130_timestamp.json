We recognize that investment in innovation is critical to our future growth profile and remains a top priority from a capital allocation standpoint. Given that we are at our lowest levels of net debt in almost five years, progressing towards a net cash position, we anticipate leaning in on some of our other capital allocation priorities beyond internal R and D.

The most pronounced area was clearly orthopedics, which is the most elective segment of our portfolio.

It's difficult for me to bracket exactly what the growth is going to be and when it's going to happen, but our goal clearly is to make our med tech sector a best-in-class performer. So that's going to be a defining element of my tenure, and we are going to be working towards that. We are going to be improving our commercial execution, as we are doing today. We'll continue to invest in our organic pipeline that is delivering.",

But I do think, you know, as a general rule, given the size of our company, that we should find some opportunity to operate where we can leverage. I would like to see us, as we separate the company, maybe be relabeled as more of a growth company, and therefore, we may reposition that, taking that top line growth and putting that back into the business.

Recently, we have divested some of the businesses like diagnostics, stents, diabetes, where we came to the conclusion that it was difficult to get into this number one, number two position and that was better to sell that business in order to create value. So given the recent divestment activity, what I want to emphasize, and I have alluded at the outset, is that my priority now is to be more on the acquisitive side and to be more aggressive on the acquisition side, identifying products that complement our portfolio but play in higher growth markets or market segments that we are today.",

In medical devices, I would say it's around the labor input costs and some of the staffing related to COVID-19, I would say in the sense of overstaffing to some degree.

Some examples of that, for example, in electrophysiology, we had a limited launch of our Qdote Micro in Europe. Qdote is a first-in-kind smart microcatheter, which is designed to deliver about two to three times the amount of energy, and at the same time, reduce the total patient exposure, and provided exposure to (inaudible) and reduced total procedure time, and that's helping us in driving our position in electrophysiology.
