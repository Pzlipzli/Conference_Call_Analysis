Currently, we expect the ultimate final not for profit price could be as much as eight dollars per dose. The final not for profit price will fluctuate until the end of the year when we know precisely all the variables that go into the calculation, namely the net cost incurred as well as volumes produced during the pandemic period. Given the firm contracts we have in place, pending advance purchase agreements, we expect to recognize vaccine sales of approximately two point five billion dollars in twenty twenty one, with more than half of that revenue likely to occur in the fourth quarter. Regarding vaccine manufacturing, we continue to expand our global network to include ten manufacturing sites for various stages of production.",

As you know, we don't provide guidance by quarter.

In addition to the what you heard from all three of our segment leaders just and improved cadence of innovation, new approvals, new offerings that offer better health care solutions. So that's how we're thinking about it. From an EPS perspective, we are challenging our teams to continue to invest. We think when we have 10% top line growth and EPS growth that will approach 20%. We think that's a very healthy to take it up today on top of what we delivered in January, which surprised to the upside as well.

But with respect to the revenue guidance, Chris, I would say coming into the year, just like every other company and probably every other industry, we remained a little bit cautious with respect to how the recovery would unfold, would there be new variants. And so we took what I thought was a very responsible and prudent approach to our expectations at the beginning of the year. That being said, I don't want to undermine just the operational performance that each of the teams are executing upon as we go throughout this year. What we did learn and it really is a credit to the leaders that you heard from today and their teams just how important it is reaching out the customers during the last 18 months, not only to find out what the status of COVID-19 was and how was impacting their businesses, but also how Johnson & Johnson could help them in the recovery. And I think that is having some -- I'll call it a goodwill factor with respect to how we're approaching our business today. With respect to operating margins in R&D, I would say that the COVID investment for the vaccine, specifically is a small part of it. What we're seeing and really what we all take great pride in is there is not one big outlying expense item or investment item in the quarter or even year-to-date with respect to milestones. It's really just the maturity of the portfolio, again across all three segments that really position us well. So last year, you might recall, we increased our R&D investment by $800 million above 2019 levels, even with all the questions and uncertainty and even though maybe competitors pulled back a little bit, we know the only right answer was to invest for the long term. We're actually at a pace this year through six months about $1.3 billion above last year's level on a six-month comparator. So we feel very well positioned. And again, with how I answered Larry earlier on the EPS accretion, we kind of think we're hitting the mark across all aspects. I don't know Jennifer is there anything else do you want to add?",

If you take a look at the strength of our pipeline as well as the continued progression, we are seeing more assets transitioning into those later stages of development that require additional costs. And as Joe had indicated earlier, the beauty right now of the strength that we have for the business is it's allowing us to invest for those future waves of innovation. So we feel real good about the level of investment for R&D and the farm group.",

So I think some of the strengths you're seeing on the topline is clearly the result of the focus on bringing strong innovation to market. We're well poised over 2-year period to deliver nearly 40, what we would call major new product launches, which is significant increase from where we've been. I think you're seeing that coupled with the recovery in the MD results and then clearly in farm double-digit growth year-to-date, strong above market performance. So I think those investments are paying off and focus on innovation will be a core focus of ours. Thanks for the question Chris. Rob, next question, please.",

And Asia is a region that is above 2019 in terms of procedure volume and clearly, really driven by China. We've seen that Japan was in lockdown, we know that Australia went back to lockdowns recently, we know India is digging out. So some of those other countries are going to be slower to recover. EMEA, we've been, which has been at a slower pace than the United States. We actually see a lot of acceleration happening right now in EMEA with the vast distribution and uptake of vaccinations. And quite frankly the backlog of patients that really need to be careful. As I mentioned, I share a little bit of the waiting list data in the UK. And the US in quarter two has had significant recovery versus the first quarter. I look at data like in January, we were down medical procedures were down about 6% in January versus 2019. And in May, that went positive to up about 3%. But as I mentioned, it's going to be not a vertical line given the recent surges that are happening in hospital systems in the US, like Florida, like Michigan and the Midwest. So again, I think our systems are unbelievably equipped to manage through this have huge respect and admiration for a lot of our customers, who are managing COVID as well as non-COVID patients.",

    "text": "Perfect. So then, as it relates to DARZALEX, starting off with DARZALEX, you saw the very strong results that we had in the quarter, also the significance of the additional indications that continue to come through and our sixth indication, specifically for the DARZALEX FASPRO application. As we take a look so far across the business already 60% of our DARZALEX business is in the subcutaneous form. And that's whether we look at the United States or whether we look outside the US. And so very, very rapid adoption, as well as expanded into additional patient populations for DARZALEX. So we're very very confident in the uptake and this is really providing significant benefits from patients going from multiple hour infusions down to a three to five minute injection. So a lot of good things to come on DARZALEX. As it relates to IMBRUVICA, we're seeing very strong growth for IMBRUVICA outside the United States. Right now, 20% growth in the quarter. As we take a look at IMBRUVICA overall, we had double-digit growth, but obviously it's less than that in the US. In the US, we're still a bit impacted. The patient volumes and new patient starts are still down a little bit in CLL due to COVID. For these patient populations, there can be more of a watchful waiting period or sometimes treatment with older therapies. And so, we did see a slower growth rate, particularly in the US, in the quarter, but we do anticipate that to rebound as we move forward and more people get vaccinated. As it relates to the competitive dynamics, IMBRUVICA remains a number one prescribed treatment in CLL and relapsed/refractory MCL and also (inaudible). So it's the number one BG's KI wherever they're prescribed, is also the only agent that Scott demonstrated overall survival in first-line CLL and safety profile that supported by over five years of follow-up and clinical experience. So we believe we've got a great profile that stands up competitively with IMBRUVICA and will continue to be able to deliver great growth for us going forward.",

And I would tell you that what we've experienced is maybe some book and like our electrical physiology business, or Afib treating cardiac ablation has kind of recovered very expeditiously, and that team right now is just really working on refilling the patient funnel. At the other book, I would say we would be cataract surgeries, which are procedure volumes are still below 2019. So we would expect that one to significantly accelerate on a balance to go. So it really depends by procedure. They really are meeting the bell curve, if you will. And again, as I kind of come back to what's going to affect the pace, it's really the -- pace of vaccinations, pace of hospitals being able to match the capacity and keep a highly engaged healthy workforce and manage through some of the surgeons that we're seeing right now in the US and other pockets of the world. And then just really patient sentiment, there's been a lot of investment that J&J has been doing to reassure patients to go seek medical care. And I think we've seen a lot of the facts and data and publications on the impact on non-COVID patients who haven't seek care. So we expect that to continue. We don't expect, again, a perfect linear. I keep saying that because we learn every week. We take four steps forward and maybe a step back. Thank you.",

It's also complemented, as Chris was mentioning with kind of our first innovation in the phacoemulsifier to Veritas. So the combination of those two with really our first advancement in monofocals in the TECNIS Eyhance, which was launched earlier in quarter one. The combination of those three innovations, I expect should improve our current run rate of revenue performance in the US surgical vision. And as you heard in quarter two, we did grow revenue versus 2019 and OUS. And so what I expect that that should have the US start to pick up more in the back half of the year.",

I would say we're very encouraging that we've had about 750 on hand demonstrations with our VELYS Knee Digital Surgery offering. We've done about 100 cases to date. What we keep hearing from customers who have been giving us really positive feedback on a couple of things, the value of the system's smaller footprint, the images intraoperative capabilities and really the ease of integration for surgeons and OR teams, the workflows, reducing the heavy physical and financial burdens of the currently available marketplace offerings. So, it's new, we just got approval also in Australia. So we're going to start to do cases in Australia. And I would say very, very encouraging. We have several different commercial models that we're assessing and we're seeing hospitals take really multiple archetypes. So stay tune on that. And then I think you had a second question, Joanne, on M&A. And I would just say, for MedTech point of view, you've seen -- we've invested over $10 billion of capital in M&A, really behind getting into eye health, getting more significant into digital surgery. And then really starting to invest in, I'll call it, standard of care changing technologies like NeuWave and ablation. For liver ablation was the first indication right now, we are under clinical trial to partner that technology with our endoluminal Monarch technology for lung cancer, the treatment of tumors or bleeding tumor cells. We're also first in human in oncolytic viruses and drug delivery using Monarch as well as starting to get a stronger foothold in the fast-growing area of stroke. Our stroke business was up over 30% in quarter two relative to 2019. So again, a procedure that was less affected in the COVID environment that we continue to build down too.

So the win is having something that's really transformational and being able to get it to patients. It's not where it originated from. And so as a result, about 50% of our products come internally, 50% externally. So for example, late last year, we brought in Bermekimab, we made the acquisition of Momenta, we brought in Taris as a drug delivery device for bladder gene therapy for geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration from Humira. And so, we really do work very, very assertively to find the best technologies in our key areas of focus and many times that's coming from our internal labs, many times it's also coming externally. So our strategy and interest there remains the same and making sure that we've got the best innovation for patients going forward. I feel like we're doing a really good job on that front.",
