Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon's Fourth-Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice-President, Investor Relations. Thanks, Brad. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe-Harbor statement, which can be found on slide two of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly-comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website, a detailed review of our fourth-quarter and full-year results. I hope you all had a chance to read the material. I'm going to briefly discuss the financial highlights before turning the call over to Hans to lead a discussion on our strategy, guidance and forward-looking view of the business. Slide three shows a summary of our results. Consolidated total operating revenue was $35.3 billion in the fourth-quarter, up 3.5% Year-over-Year. Wireless Service revenue grew 5.9% Year-over-Year in the fourth-quarter, benefiting from unlimited plan migrations, our best fourth-quarter total postpaid net additions in seven years, pricing actions that we began implementing in June of 2022 and a full-quarter contribution from TracFone. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $11.7 billion for the fourth quarter, down 0.2% Year-over-Year. Wireless Service revenue growth was offset by higher promotional expense, declines in our high-margin legacy wireline business and inflationary cost pressures. Adjusted earnings per share in the fourth-quarter was $1.19, a decrease of 10.5% compared to the similar period in 2021, driven by higher interest expense, depreciation and lower pension-related income. Finally, we delivered $14.1 billion of free-cash flow for the full-year 2022 and exited the year with a net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7 times. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.

Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
Thank you, Brady and good morning, everyone. On today's earnings call, I will focus on strategy, guidance and expectations for the business and why I'm so excited about the opportunities for the year ahead.

Let me start by saying that we delivered against all our revised financial targets provided in July, including 8.6% Wireless Service revenue growth, $47.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share of $5.18. I'm pleased at the momentum build during the third quarter continued into the fourth-quarter.

Last quarter, we said the expectation of a positive consumer phone net-adds in the fourth-quarter, and we delivered against that expectation. Although we have more work to do, I am encouraged by the improvements and expect to build on the momentum into 2023. The improvement in consumer performance was complemented by yet another strong mobility quarter in Verizon Business Group, as well as continued success in fixed wireless access with net-adds up sequentially in both consumer and business. Together with five years result, we added 416,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, our best total broadband performance in over a decade, and approximately 1.3 million total broadband net-adds for the year.

Regarding our guidance, we have positioned ourselves to improve on our performance in 2023. And expect to build a good underlying operational momentum, although that will be offset by the impact of the non-cash factors such as promo amortization in our revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA.

Additionally, we are seeing some impact of high-interest rates. At the same time, we expect our capital spending to reduce significantly in 2023, as we reached the end of our incremental C-band spending, which will be a tailwind for free-cash flow. We are striving to make further improvement and take even more actions that will ultimately lead to better performance than the guidance we have outlined today.

Matt will discuss the guidance in more detail later in the call. The industry enters 2023 continued macroeconomic uncertainty, as elevated inflation and interest rates impact the broader economy. Still, demand for our services remains strong, given the growing importance of mobility and broadband to both consumers and businesses.

The culmination of our network reliability, diverse portfolio of products and services and the industry's strongest customer-base provides us the flexibility to meet the changing customer needs even in difficult economic environment. We measure our success in maximizing value across stakeholders by our ability to grow service revenue, EBITDA and cash-flow. Taking these three metrics together is how we hold ourselves accountable. We're well-positioned to improve our performance and accelerate growth on a go-forward basis, with network quality as the foundation for our strategy and growth. We expect the wireless mobility and nationwide broadband will be the most significant contributors to Verizon's growth for the next several years.

In 2022, we made important progress in each of these businesses. Our growth in these areas will be driven by expanding our network advantage, using our C-band spectrum, which we expect will strengthen our network leadership in the coming years.

We're taking a balanced approach on how we run our business. Adding the right customers and generating ongoing profits from them, is how we maximize value. We remain focused on our cost-reduction and efficiency actions, while also maximizing our return on invested capital via better monetizing our assets, to put us on track to improve free-cash flow going-forward. We are proud of being the strongest in the industry in terms of generating cash and want to preserve that while also continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We are executing with discipline and we will continue driving a strategy which produces sustainable long-term growth and profitability.

As connectivity plays an increasingly important role for consumers and businesses, it is the quality of the connectivity that matters the most. Not all networks are odd to take that and build the same, nor have the same quality. We have seen these differences in the past and expect that 5G will be no different. Our engineers have the best track-record for designing and building networks that produce the best experience. Our network will continue to evolve with a relentless commitment to quality and reliability, adding capacity when needed and feeling service gaps where they exist, even as capital intensity declines in the coming years.

In the shift to 5G, we've been rapidly building out our C-band spectrum with the most aggressive deployment plan in our Company's history. We're tracking the 200 million POPs this quarter and are well-ahead of schedule to reach our 250 million POPs targeted by year end 2024.

C-band propagation is very similar to that of AWS and PCS spectrum, which covers more than 300 million POPs today. This gives us a clear path to scale C-band quickly and efficiently, including 330 markets where we expect to gain complete access to the C-band spectrum later this year. Due to the timing of spectrum availability or deployment strategy, targets the highest user areas first, with the capability to deliver the most distinguished experience in places where the majority of customers consume mobile services.

As additional spectrum is cleared, we will have access to many new markets, as with prior generations of wireless technology, customers in all areas can expect to receive the best network experience.

And where we have built-out the C-band, we're only getting started. Early deployments have limited to 60 megahertz or 100 megahertz in some early clearance markets, consumer performance in these market has been encouraging, as is evidenced by better retention, more favorable gross add trends and higher premium uptake.

In addition, the majority of our consumer fixed wireless net-adds are on C-band, with the final tranche of spectrum expected to be available in late 2023, we can deploy an average of 161 megahertz and upto 200 megahertz in certain markets across the entire Continental US. When we turn-on the full breadth of spectrum, we expect peak download speeds 2.4gigabits-per-second, up from the 900 megabits-per-second we see with 60 megahertz deployed, all while supporting far more users and applications.

At the same time, we're also deploying our 5G standalone core. So by the end-of-the year, you should see a network with incredible speeds both downlink and uplink, and position to deliver 5G capabilities, such as network slicing, voice over 5G and-or among others.

We believe our network will allow us to maintain our premium position with our wireless mobility customers and provide reliable fixed wireless access services to consumers and businesses across the country. This is an example how we can monetize our multipurpose network by scaling several revenue stream on the same infrastructure to enhance our return on investment. We're adding far more capacity to our network than the peak usage increase we're expecting in fixed wireless markets. We continue to expect, they will add 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless subscribers by the end of 2025 and those subscribers will be enabled by our current build and capital plans.

Our mobility and broadband plans are supported by our deep fiber position and ongoing fiber investments. Approximately 50% of our sites are now served by own fiber, up from 45% last year. We believe, we are the only provider serving the level of its wireless network with its own fiber. This supports superior quality of services and end-to-end owners economics. That means better reliability and higher margins. And look for us to continue to expand the percentage of sites on our own fiber.

We also expanded our Fios footprint by over 550,000 locations in 2022, extending our Fios open for sales to more than 70 million locations. You can expect continued fiber expansion in the years ahead.

In summary, network quality is the foundation for our strategy and growth, and all of the moves we're making are focused on ensuring we continue our network leadership in the future. As I mentioned earlier, Verizon's success should be measured against three important metrics: Service Revenue, EBITDA and Free-cash flow. Let me now cover each of these in detail and tell you why I'm so confident in our ability to deliver against all three of these benchmarks.

We expect that our network differentiation will be the cornerstone of our service revenue growth and that will allow us to continue to attract the highest-quality customer-base in the industry and maintain our market-leading share of the B2B market. Our fixed wireless access is also expected to contribute more meaningfully to service revenue as we enter the year growing rapidly with a base of more than 1.4 million subscribers.

2022 demonstrated to us that we need to be even more agile and responsive in the consumer market. This is one of the reasons I assumed leadership of the business, late last year.

We're moving into 2023 with momentum and expectation for improved performance-based on recent actions and planning initiatives. After integrating TracFone last year, we now have full complement of offerings from entry-level prepaid, all the way up the premium unlimited post-paid plans for the first time in our history. This will enable us to better attract new customers, while also retaining customers through their mobile journey.

You have already seen us take more segmented approach to the market through the Welcome Unlimited and One Unlimited plans in postpaid and the launch of Total by Verizon in prepaid. We're already seeing the benefits from these actions. In 2023, our plans will continue to evolve, as we look for the best ways to cater to our customers, whether through network experience, content or other product offerings. Each new offering gives us an opportunity to engage with a prospective customer and ensure they receive the plan that best fits their needs.

We remain disciplined around our core pricing and continued to perform well with our premium customers on retention and step-up activity. As we move into 2023, we're taking a more localized approach with our network and go-to-market strategy, providing greater autonomy to the teams on the front-line and speeding up the pace of decision-making. This will allow us to compete more effectively across geographies, particularly where dynamics may differ by individual market.

Finally, we continue to revise our sales compensation structure, ensuring we have the right incentives in place to drive sales growth. The customers we have and continue to attract represent the highest quality customer-base in the industry. Based on our customer payment patterns, which are at or better than pre-pandemic levels and the low delinquency rates in our secured drives device payment plan portfolios, we continue to see only a limited impact from the macroeconomic environment on our customers.

While we're watching this closely, we have a lot of confidence in the resilience of our customer-base. Standing on new businesses such as private 5G networks and Edge computing will also be a strategic focus in 2023. Our funnel is strong and we're making the appropriate investments to ensure such services provide a meaningful contribution to fuel the growth in the years ahead, which differentiates us in the industry.

You can expect Verizon to compete, but I want to underline again that we will not sacrifice financial for volumes. We continue to focus on improving our cost of acquisition and retention and believe current promotional incentives are not sustainable for the industry in the long-run. Although we have participated to some extent in this dynamic, expect us to pursue more ways to move away from the aggressive handset subsidies, with offers like Welcome Unlimited plan, which offers attractive headline pricing for customers, while reducing device subsidies. We manage the business for profitability and such actions drive healthy lifetime value for the business.

Moving to business wireline, we're taking several actions to reduce the financial impact of the unit and are scaling back on pursuing low-margin revenue in order to again, drive improved profitability. While this may result in missing out revenue, it is the right move and one that will lead to higher-margin and cash-flow over time.

At the same time, we are focused on further improving the cost structure through greater efficiencies. You may recall, that we embarked on a new cost-cutting initiatives late last year. The component of this initiative is the formation of Verizon Global Services. This organization is accelerating efforts to drive cross-functional efficiencies, enabling us to reinvest savings in network superiority and customer growth while contributing to-long-term profitability. Additional opportunity exist in-sourcing, sales and marketing and corporate system among others. The heavy lifting is now underway, as we execute against our goal to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion of run-rate savings by 2025.

So, our EBITDA strategy is clear. Grow profitable volumes in both consumer and business, based on our increasingly differentiated network and manage our expenses the way you would expect us to do. By growing service revenue and EBITDA, we believe that we will be able to provide our shareholders with increasingly healthy free-cash flow, which will support the strength of our balance sheet and fund our dividend growth. Our current streak of raising the dividend 16 years-in-a-row is unmatched in the industry and we intend to be able to continue that trend, because our mobility and fixed wireless access products leverage the same infrastructure, they provide a capital-efficient path to future cash-flow growth. We believe that we will become increasingly efficient with our capital, using less capital to generate every dollar of revenue for years to come. That's what enables us to produce expanding cash-flow that we can both reinvest in our business, a return to our shareholders.

And as you know, we do all of this as our capital spending budget is expected to decline from $23.1 billion in 2022, to under $19 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range this year. A reduction of nearly 20% Year-over-Year. In 2024, we expect our CapEx to be around $17 billion, which we expect to represent the lowest capital intensity in over a decade and among the lowest in the industry. We expect we will deliver a best-in-class network experience, while reducing our 2022 CapEx leveraged by more than $5 billion over the next couple of years.

With that, I turn it over to Matt to discuss guidance.

Matt Ellis{BIO 17999186 <GO>}
Thank you, Hans, and good morning. I want to spend some time walking you through our 2023 guidance, while also commenting on our longer-term outlook. Our 2023 guidance reflects momentum we have exiting 2022, which we expect to drive wireless service revenue growth. For 2023, we expect total Wireless Service revenues grow between 2.5% and 4.5%, driven by increased penetration of premium Unlimited plans, scaling of fixed wireless, continued growth in products and services such as content and device protection plans and the full-year impact of our pricing actions taken in 2022. As noted in our earnings materials, our Wireless Service revenue growth outlook includes an approximately 190 basis-point benefit from a larger allocation of administrative and telco recovery fees, which partially recovered network operating costs to Wireless Service revenue from other revenue.

In addition, we expect promo amortization to be approximately $1 billion higher than last year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within a range of $47.0 billion to $48.5 billion. This outlook reflects expected higher Wireless Service revenue offset by wireline and other revenue declines, and higher marketing and network operating expenses.

Full-year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $4.55 to $4.85. As noted on our third-quarter earnings call, higher interest rates are expected to result in approximately $0.25 to $0.30 of interest expense pressure in 2023, due to higher floating-rate debt costs and higher securitization costs for our growing device payment portfolios.

We continue to believe we have the right debt structure for the long-term and have managed the balance sheet appropriately by keeping short-term maturities to a minimum in this higher interest-rate environment. Higher rates, pension and OPEB, in addition to lower pension asset-base resulting from negative returns in 2022 are also expected to impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.12 to $0.15 compared to 2022. This flows through other income and expense on our income statement.

Finally, we expect approximately $0.3 to $0.5 of impact from higher depreciation expense, primarily driven by the C-band equipment being put into service across '22 and into '23.

Our adjusted effective income tax-rate is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.0% based on current legislation. Capital spending for the full-year is expected to be between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion, including the final, approximately $1.75 billion of the incremental $10 billion of C-band related capital spending. And we continue to expect total capital spending to be approximately $17 billion in 2024. The reduction from the $23.1 billion CapEx in 2022 is expected to drive higher free-cash flow-in 2023 despite increases in cash interest and cash taxes. As previously discussed, we will complete our accelerated $10 billion C-band program this year, after which all C-band capital expenditures will be part of our business-as-usual capital program.

Looking beyond 2023, given our exit-rate from 2022, we don't expect to hit the long-range outlook, as we projected at the Investor Day last year. However, due to the way we have positioned our network and service offerings coming into 2023, we do expect increasing growth in revenue and cash-flow in subsequent years.

I will now turn it back over to Hans.

Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
Thank you, Matt. Let me summarize the Verizon opportunity in a few key points. We're making the necessary improvements to drive better performance. We are the best network and it's only getting better even as capital intensity improves. We have the largest EBITDA base in the industry and a clear path to free-cash flow expansion. And finally, we have one of the most attractive dividends in the market and we intend to be able to continue the trend of growing the dividend each year.

By that, I hand it over to Brady to start the Q&A.

Brady Connor{BIO 17932144 <GO>}
Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) One moment please for our first question. Your first question comes from Simon Flannery, of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.

Q - Simon Flannery{BIO 1505834 <GO>}
Thanks a lot and good morning. I had a couple of questions on the guidance. The first one is, how are you thinking about your confidence and the visibility of this guide as compared to a year-ago, obviously we'd had the war and stuff like that, but I think the that the reductions in guidance obviously, were a concern for investors? So, as you went through this process, was there deliberate conservatism that you were trying to bake-in, to make sure that you could hit and I think, Hans, you might have mentioned exceed the guidance and with additional steps, so that kind of set-up would be great, and then I guess for Matt, you called out some of the pressures on the bottom-line, but you had a $0.30 range on your EPS guide. I think it was $0.15 a year-ago and it sounds like on the items you gave, the range wasn't that wide. So, perhaps you can just give us some color on what caused you to be as wide this year-on the EPS? Thank you.

A - Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
Thank you, Simon. I can start and when it comes to the guidance, I mean, we, of course, it's a little bit uncertain, as we said coming into the year, but we are laser-focused on the service growth and on the EBITDA expansion and hence also the cash-flow expansion, that's how we're running our business and that's how we take decisions.

And as I've said, I mean, our job is of course, to see that we are meeting or exceeding the guidance we have given out, and that's how we're going to work all the year and our teams are set-up to work like that. We are in the beginning of the year, so we're going to see how it turns out, but clearly we have a super laser-focused in the whole company how we are executing right now and how it hangs together.

And as I said before, we have now all the assets. All the way from the network to our, to the prepaid to the postpaid, all that and from us is a lot of execution in a competitive market, but we definitely believe we can compete very well in that market, Matt?

A - Matt Ellis{BIO 17999186 <GO>}
Thanks, Hans. Good morning, Simon. So, if you think about the guide for the year, obviously it as a number of items in there, as I think about the range, we can get to the top-end of the range there with strong execution, the activity around the cost programs scaling, that flywheel moving faster than our base assumption. And just if we see more volumes come through the business there. Obviously, the low-end will reflect the promo environment, the overall competitive environment, and then we'll save items like inflation and so on. So the range of the EPS guide, I think is very similar to the EBITDA guide that we've given and I think it reflects, as we come into this year, when you think about some of the unknowns that will play-out here is in the macro-environment and the competitive environment, we feel is the right range to have for 2023, Hans said, there's a lot of things for us to stay focused on and make sure we produce the best result possible.

Q - Simon Flannery{BIO 1505834 <GO>}
Thank you.

A - Brady Connor{BIO 17932144 <GO>}
Thanks, Simon. Brad, ready for the next question.

Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open sir.

Q - John Hodulik{BIO 1540944 <GO>}
Great, thanks guys. Can you talk about consumer margins within the guidance, though they were down about 400 basis, almost 400 basis-points in '22 and Matt and Hans, how do you guys get some good color and some puts and takes around promotions around Verizon Global Services and I guess, higher marketing and network operation costs, but I guess, any other puts and takes to call-out? And as we look into '23, as part of the guidance, should we expect the consumer margins that sort of flattened here and you guys have visibility that as you guys, a lot of these initiatives take hold, that we can start to see some improving margins on the consumer side? Thanks.

A - Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
Thank you. I mean, I can start and I mean, of course, we're doing quite a lot in the consumer segment right now, all the way from addressing areas where we have softness in our portfolio, with Welcome for example, in order to create growth, but also, we're regionalizing our business, both on the network side and the consumer side, in order to take quick decision, but also that the network is so strong in local markets, where we're building out the C-Band, we want to take advantage of that, and as we said before, we have the chance to -- no we don't have a chance, we see the correlation between C-band deployment and step-ups and of course, fixed wireless access and the majority of fixed wireless access customers are coming on C-band right now. So that's why.

And finally, we have also worked with spending the consumer investment, I call it, all the way, what we're doing above-the-line on promo, what were doing below-the-line on retention and how much we do in media. We're doing that much more agile. I think that will help us to manage and continue our clear path and a clear target of growing our topline and expanding or EBITDA, that's our job. Then there are some headwinds that Matt just talked about, but our underlying should be improving with the cost cuts and the way we are working in the consumer group. Matt?

A - Matt Ellis{BIO 17999186 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks, Hans. Good morning, John. So if you think about the Year-over-Year reduction in '22, remember, at the start of the year, we said that we expected about a 200 basis-point impact because of the inclusion of TracFone in the business for the year. Obviously, accretive in absolute terms, but from a margin standpoint, we did expect to see that. So, then obviously, there is some other items in there. We talked a little bit about the inflation impact last year. Obviously, the competitive environment and the promo piece in there as well. So there'll be some things that we have the opportunity to improve on this year, synergies from within TracFone, as we move more customers over to our own network will be an upside. But then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, obviously, the promo amortization expected to be up on a Year-over-Year basis, as the delay between being at these higher levels from a cash basis and then that flowing through on an accounting basis.

So, when you net those things out, expect something initially on a probably a similar type of level in '23 to '22, with some opportunities to push that as we go-forward into subsequent years.

Q - John Hodulik{BIO 1540944 <GO>}
Great, thanks guys.

A - Brady Connor{BIO 17932144 <GO>}
Yes, thanks, John. Brad, we're ready for the next question.

Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open sir.

Q - Brett Feldman{BIO 3825792 <GO>}
Thanks. I'm actually going to stick with Consumer and I was hoping to get a little more insight into two different tools you're using to go to market, the first is Welcome Unlimited, you've been advertising it quite a bit and you've mentioned a couple times during your prepared remarks. I am wondering to what extent are you finding that Welcome Unlimited, is indeed a popular plan with new consumers versus the extent to which is driving wireless shoppers into your channels, where you're actually more frequently converting them into a higher-tiered plans, that's the first question.

And then, it seems like you have been reluctant to make greater use of device promos, obviously you're using them to some extent last year. How are you thinking about the role of device promos as you go to market this year and you look to sort of sustain these positive consumer phone net-adds? Thank you.

A - Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
Thanks, thanks. The Welcome Unlimited is working exactly as we wanted. I mean it creates the store traffic. We bring our customers in and we see that the customer gets the plans they want. We have, we have not seen any step-downs over that is coming from that, we're more seeing an opportunity for our customers, to have a conversation with them. And of course, remember that's a bring-your-own-device, it's for four lines and that's the way we have been dealing. And we learned a lot from the first Welcome we started with, somewhere in the third-quarter, I remember, or beginning, end-of-the-second, when we saw a little bit. And that was an area where we were soft. That's why we clearly saw that customers were going to others. This will now have diverted, then it comes out. And if you then add that, you see your Premium Unlimited continued to do well, we went up now to 45% actually from 41% in the third-quarter. I think, so we added 4% more on Unlimited Premium. So, that is work-in-progress, we just need to be agile, stay close to see which segment and then be aggressive in this segment we need, and the segment we were performing well in and we'll have them continue to perform well.

When it comes to device promos, yeah we understand as part of the competition and impact of the market, we will be important in that as well, but we will continue to be cautious and see that we're actually using device promos in the right moment for the right customers and you saw us last year, coming in and out, sometimes we're a little bit more aggressive and others we were actually the least aggressive, and I think that's how we will continue this year, depending on where the market is going. But what you can expect from us in the consumer unit is to be agile, take quick decisions and see if they're working, then we'll continue, if they're not working, we're pulling them. That's why, I mean to this basically, everyday myself nowadays and I think this is proven that we get the momentum with the team and the team is actually executing well. We have more to do, I mean, I always say that, I mean, it's going to take long-time before I feel that I'm 100% satisfied or happy, but definitely, it's work to do here, but I see the good momentum.

Q - Brett Feldman{BIO 3825792 <GO>}
Thank you.

A - Brady Connor{BIO 17932144 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks, Brett. Brad, ready for the next question.

Operator
The next question comes from Phil Cusack, of JPMorgan. Your line is open.

Q - Phil Cusick{BIO 5507514 <GO>}
Hi, guys. Thank you. Thinking with wireless, on service revenue, when I pull out the definition change from other to service revenue, you're guiding to roughly 1% to 2% wireless service revenue growth in '23, which is a big deceleration from almost 6% this quarter. How should we think about this in regards to phone adds and ARPU and the impact of promotions on service revenues? Can you just put the pieces together for us? And do you expect that revenue will stay positive each quarter this year or actually flip to a negative at some point?

And just on-top of that, typically, we see things much slower in terms of subscribers from 4Q to 1Q, while I don't expect you to guidance subscribers, do you think we'll see sort of typical seasonality this quarter or do you anticipate sort of better performance? Thank you very much.

A - Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
I can start and then Matt can break-down the numbers you're talking about. I mean, yes, we, on the premium segment, there is seasonality in the first-quarter and I don't think that's going to be different this year. However, our work is to keep up the momentum that we had in fourth-quarter into this year, where we had good store traffic year quarter-over-quarter and also high conversion rate, but it also means that we need to be agile and see what's happening in the market and it's little bit early to do any guidance or something like that, which we're not doing on net-adds, but clearly, there is going to be seasonality, but we have good momentum and we're going to continue to execute and be very close to the markets. Matt?

A - Matt Ellis{BIO 17999186 <GO>}
Yeah, Phil. So kind of unpacking some of the piece parts of your question there. So seasonality, absolutely, we expect that to look reasonably as you would expect throughout the year from an overall standpoint. In terms of the service revenue guide, your math there is correct, when you think about fourth-quarter, you say close to 6%, remember that included a full-quarter of owning tracking 4Q this year versus only part of 4Q last year, so as we get into '23, finally, on a Year-over-Year basis, to talk about stuff on an apples-to-apples basis or not, with and without M&A items which is nice. So, once you remove that, very similar.

In terms of the piece parts within wireless service revenue guide, think about, you've got the positive impacts of the price ups, obviously, we had six months impact last year, approximately, you had a full-year impact this year. Also the benefit of FWA momentum we had and having 1.4 million subscribers in the base at the start of this year that we're building throughout the year. But that's offset by the (inaudible) amortization, which as I've mentioned in the upfront comments, will be higher in the income statement Year-over-Year, with the timing of the recognition of that. And then also the impact of the volumes last year offsetting some of the ARPA benefit we had. So, the task for the team going-forward is to continue the momentum that we started to see in the second-half of last year, as Hans mentioned, and that will put us in a position to continue to push service revenue in the positive direction going-forward.

Q - Phil Cusick{BIO 5507514 <GO>}
Thanks guys.

A - Brady Connor{BIO 17932144 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks Phil. Brad, we're ready to take the next question.

Operator
Thank you. The next question is from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.

Q - David Barden{BIO 1506279 <GO>}
Hey guys, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. The first one maybe, Matt, could we refresh the free-cash flow outlook for 2023? I think the midpoint was $21 billion for 2023 from last year's Analyst Day. I think if we look at the EBITDA guidance, which is roughly flat, the interest expense guidance, which is up $1 billion, the CapEx, which is down $4 billion, it feels like it should be roughly $17 billion unless there's other things in taxes, and working capital-related to some of these promotions. So if you could kind of refresh that a little bit, that would be awesome.

And then Hans, you called out three things as it relates to the C-band deployment and this has been a big success for Verizon, is getting this bill done. I think that some people have been asking themselves like where the return is from all the money that's been spent? And you highlighted, higher retention, better gross adds and higher premium take rate. Are there numbers that you can put around that, that we could grab on to and say, oh, when in 2024, Verizon doubles their footprint and C-band with the new spectrum getting cleared, we can put a number on that and say, oh, this is going to be the return Verizon gets from this build? Thank you so much.

A - Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
Why don't you start, Matt and I take the second question on the C-band.

A - Matt Ellis{BIO 17999186 <GO>}
Yeah, so on the free-cash flow, David. Obviously, last year we we said that we expect, you have the right number of expectation, where we said free-cash flow might be for '23. As, I think about where we see the business today versus where it was a year-ago, couple of factors that a different, CapEx is very much in-line with where we thought it would be at this point, team did a great job last year deploying C-band and obviously, we spent most of the $10 billion. So you're going to have a nice Year-over-Year benefit, offsetting that cash taxes will be higher this year as we have less benefit from a higher CapEx number and also both depreciation dropping down, that was in our expectation last year.

Interest rates were obviously very different than we expected last year, you touched on those. And then, the jump-off point from the EBITDA on the business at the end of '22 to '23, lower than we hoped to be at the Investor Day a year-ago.

So you've got the right moving parts there, we're not guiding specifically to a cash-flow number, we historically haven't, but you've got the right moving pieces in there. So net-net, the CapEx reduction Year-over-Year gives us a good tailwind to think about cash-flow for this year.

So with that, I'll hand over Hans to talk about the C-band question.

A - Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
Yeah, and it's, of course, focus for us to continue to grow the cash-flow as we have said so many times, so we will continue on that work. When it comes to the C-band, first of all, we have said from the beginning, the C-band acquisition we did is a multi-decade spectrum, it's going to, it's so much and in so many years and of course, that was a deliberate decision because we believe we're going to be in wireless business for the eternity of Verizon's history, so that's very important. However, when it comes to seeing an impact, and I think I mentioned some of them. If you think about fixed wireless access, the majority of all new customers are coming on the C-band right now, that's a clear indication. Without the C-band we couldn't grow the broadband right now. We did historic high 1.4 billion net-adds in the year of broadband subscribers. So, of course, a lot to contribute to the C-band and that's the clear metrics I have. The other metrics I have is, of course, Unlimited Premium, where we say that actually we're performing very well, where we have deployed the C-band in order to get the customer to step-up. And the step-up is very important and we are in a multi subscription business. We are in a subscription business and the more you can see that you upgrading the price, the P on the quantity, it's enormously important for long-term value for our customers. The third one that is coming, and I mentioned also when I, when I opened this, of course private 5G networks, mobile edge compute, all that is of course, going to be very much supported by the C-band as well. There we will come back and talk, report on that when we feel that that is coming into the play from a more significant portion.

But mobility, and remember also that we had the wireless business side, the business side is actually growing because of the reliability of our network and the resilience of our network, which is how our enterprise customers are buying from us when it comes to wireless business. So, I think there are many metrices that you can see already now that it's really connected to C-band.

And I just want to remind you, it's almost, let's say, I think it's one year since we got, since we launched the c-band. It's only one year and we are, we going to cross 200 million ports. We have never built so fast in the entire history of the Company and we're well-ahead of the plan to hit the 250 million POPs that we said at the Investor Day by end of '24. So, I think that this is really a game-changer in the market and we see performance wise, we outperform well, the most resilient 5G network in the nation and we're just starting, just starting with 60 and 100 megahertz. And as you heard me talking, we have 116 average, it's going to be 200 later on. It is a game-changer and we can already see it right now and we see already metrics right now that is proving it.

The next question comes from Craig Moffett, of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. I'm sorry. Michael Rollins of Citibank, your line is open.

Q - Michael Rollins{BIO 1959059 <GO>}
Hi, good morning. Two questions if I could. The first one, as you mentioned earlier in discussion, that you pulled back from some of those longer-term targets that you had, previously added the three-plus percent service revenue and other growth for this year and four-plus percent for next year, can you unpack the categories that are at or above the plan from a few years ago? And then the areas of shortfall and if those areas give you those as temporary or more permanent changes in the opportunity for Verizon? Thanks.

A - Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
Okay, I can start. I mean, first of all, we were we're more confident than ever that we have the right strategy and we've have the five vectors of growth. All of them are going along, some are actually exceeding our expectation, some are little bit slower, and some have a little bit different jump-off points. That's where we are, but there is no difference how we see the market and how we believe we can compete in all the five vectors of growth that we outlined last-time. It's more a push in time than something else because of this year or this year '22, I guess I should say, had some jump-off that is not really helping us.

But all in all, the whole strategy where we're going, I have a lot of confidence in our team, the team has a lot of confidence we're executing, we're eliminating the things that has been distracting us, all the rates on Verizon Media Group, et-cetera. Then we have some headwinds that we constantly work with as well that we don't talk so much about, of the wireline side, I talked about that today. I mean, everything from the cost-out, but not only that we going to be even more prudent what type of business we're taking, which will reduce our topline, probably, but it will improve our profitability and cash-flow. So you're going to see we are taking many actions to see that we are delivering on the plans, the long-term plans, but there are some shifts in it. Matt?

A - Matt Ellis{BIO 17999186 <GO>}
Yeah. Thanks Hans. So Mike, as you think about the conversation we had last year and we talked about the long-term outlook, we provided the piece parts. Maybe if I go through some of those and where we are. Some of them we are absolutely where we expect it to be, think about nationwide broadband with the year we had on FWA but also Fios and the expectation to continue to see very good progress there. That's very much in-line with the expectations we outlined a year-ago, also business segment mobility results with six consecutive quarters above 150,000 net-adds, very much in-line with the expectations that we had at the Investor Day.

Couple of areas where we are behind versus our expectation at that point in time. Firstly, you see one of them the mobile edge compute in 5G private networks. You talked about it, the technology adoption there on a new technology that adoption curve, a little slower then there maybe we would like, but as you heard from Hans in the prepared remarks, I feel we're now starting to see some momentum there. So, still feel good about the opportunity there, but the pace of the adoption curve, a little different than than we we hoped it might be, but the upside there still looks very good.

And then of course, the other one consumer mobility. At this time a year-ago, we had higher expectations to '22 than where we ended-up. Obviously, a lot of that variance occurred in the first part of the year and you saw the actions taken. But as you think about the piece parts, so the long-term outlook that we described a year-ago and then how those have played out in the past 12 months, hopefully, that gives you a little more color in terms of where things are moving along very much in-line, where we also saw some areas where we've had to -- where we have opportunity to see further improvement as we go-forward.

Q - Michael Rollins{BIO 1959059 <GO>}
Thanks.

A - Brady Connor{BIO 17932144 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks Mike. Brad, ready for the next question.

Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.

Q - Craig Moffett{BIO 5987555 <GO>}
Yes, hi, sorry, I hope you can hear me. So, Hans, I wonder if you could just talk a bit about your bundling strategy, particularly on the consumer side. With both the strength now in fixed wireless, but also Fios, is it your view that, that going-forward the consumer is going to buy wireless and wireline, or fixed access together or is that more of a sort of financial bundling strategy rather than a real product bundling strategy?

A - Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
Hey, Craig. No. I think it's a really good question. Of course, we have see this is a very strong consumer movement in Europe that is through a high degree have convergence. On the US, where I would say, much lower. But clearly, it is something that our customers are asking for. So it's actually consumer feedback and I spent a lot of time in the stores, meeting a lot of our consumers and they see a clear advantage to have the same provider on the broadband, as on the wireless. And I don't think we will get to any European levels but clearly this is a movement and Verizon is in a super good position here, where owners economics on our broadband and on our wireless nationwide, both of them and that's of course, we're going to meet the customers here. If the customer thinks that is what they need, we're going to operate and that's why we have this bundles in the market, if they want to have them separate, we can do that as well, web owners economics on both of them, but I think that trend will continue given the consumer research we are doing and consumers we are talking to that that's something that it's accurate.

And it's not only consumers, you need to think about small and medium business as well, make it convenient for them, both having the wireless and broadband, because any SMB today and we spent -- we probably sell to half of SMBs in the country. Any SMB today need a digital front door and then being mobile-first. So this is a really good for us. And if you look at our numbers this year on both on fixed wireless access and mobility in the business segment, SMB has been very important for us. So yes. I think there's something in there definitely, and it's the consumer desire and we're going to meet that desire as we as we continue.

Q - Craig Moffett{BIO 5987555 <GO>}
And are there big differences between the way you think about it in Fios versus non-Fios markets?

A - Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
No, it's not that different. We see it in the same way. If the customer, of course, we're much more mature historically in the Fios footprint. On the other side, when we do fixed wireless access, it's a much more natural discussion with the customer, as we have it from the beginning. So I would say that we probably a big opportunity on the Fios segment to have customer growth on the fixed and mobile. On the fixed wireless access, I think there you start actually, on a strong position when you start offering fixed wireless access with many of the customers, so they'll come in either or a cable provider and have our wireless and that's how they move over to us.

Q - Craig Moffett{BIO 5987555 <GO>}
Got it. All right. Thank you.

A - Brady Connor{BIO 17932144 <GO>}

Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Your line is open.

Q - Kannan Venkateshwar{BIO 15351027 <GO>}
Thank you. Hans, like, when we think about the balance between unit growth versus pricing, obviously, you guys have made a deliberate choice not to chase unit growth in near-term, but could you help us think through how you think about this longer-term because once you cede market-share, obviously, it can be pretty expensive to get it back. And so when we think about this balance between pricing and unit growth, how important is unit growth, not just for short-term, as you look at 2023, but also a longer-term especially, in -- when it comes to postpaid phone growth. Thank you.

A - Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
Thank you. No, good question. I think that as you heard, or at least. I mean, we think that the profitable growth is the most important, both, to have the right customers retained with us and the ones we are getting. So that's the overarching measurement we need to have. Then of course, it's always going to be a new customers are important for our base. But remember also, this market right now, if you talk about the premium segment, there are, of course, a certain amount of switchers in the market and then there are a certain amount of people going from pre to postpaid. There is no infusion of new customers in the system. So -- the coming from two sources. And you need to think about how you do that and I think we have a great opportunity right now, with the TracFone brands we have, to see and Total Wireless, to see that we are taking care of that pre-to-post migration, which we're not been part of before, we still have some work with the IT stacks and all of that, but clearly, today we are running on both sides.

And on the switcher pool, yeah we, there, we're going to be seeing that we're prudent and disciplined, but we'll go for the units we think are right. So but it's a subscription model long-term that is even more important to increase the fee sometimes, than increasing the queue because this is long-term, that just stay with the customers to get the long-term value from them, but it's a balance of it all-the-time, and that we'll continue to have.

Q - Kannan Venkateshwar{BIO 15351027 <GO>}
All right. Thank you.

A - Brady Connor{BIO 17932144 <GO>}

Operator
The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.

Q - Doug Mitchelson
Thanks so much. You talked about amortization being up $1 billion for phone subsidies to catch-up with cash spending. Embedded in all your guidance is cash spending at peak levels, is there a scope for it still to go higher? I know it depends on the competitive environment that it could eventually improve. But are we at peak levels and just a question of amortization catching-up.

And I'm curious, when you think about the service revenue guide for wireless, are there any price increases anticipated in that guide and kind of what level of price increase. I know it's a sensitive topic, but just curious how we should think about that revenue growth? Thank you.

A - Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
Thank you. Now, if we talk about the price increases, I just want to come back to what I've said before. I mean, we will be surgical and segmented in our approach. There are certain segments we need to be more aggressive on there might be areas where we see opportunities for price increases. There are no major price increases included at this moment, we need to see where the market is going and also where cost levels are going. But we will always look at that, but it's nothing right now that we have in our plans. Matt?

A - Matt Ellis{BIO 17999186 <GO>}
Yeah, on the the promotion piece, you got the understanding of the accounting treatment versus the cash, Doug and certainly, our assumption is that the marketplace will continue to be competitive, but we're not going to go into this, 100% details of what's in the guide there, but we do assume that, we'll continue to see competitive level in-line with the past, couple of years and then, as Hans said, we'll continue to look for ways to put plans in the marketplace and reduce the level of subsidy out there as well and we'll continue to push for those opportunities.

Q - Doug Mitchelson
Great, thank you.

A - Brady Connor{BIO 17932144 <GO>}

Operator
The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open, sir.

Q - Tim Horan{BIO 1503813 <GO>}
Thanks, guys. Matt, can you talk about your goals for free-cash flow and specifically, how much do you think you can reduce the debt by per year kind of going-forward at this point? And then secondly, can you talk about the gating factor for fixed wireless growth? It seems like you're implying with your 2025 guidance, that this is kind of a good run-rate, but yet your speeds are going to be increasing threefold and coverage, you're going to basically get a massive amount of capacity kind of going out there, but do you think this is a good run-rate for fixed wireless, where it can accelerate? Thanks.

A - Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
I can start with fixed wireless access. First of all, we are reiterating what we said in Investor Day, 4 million to 5 million subscribers on fixed wireless access. Our job is always to try to beat that, but that was worth reiterating that and we are well-ahead on that plan. Then the second is, of course, that when it comes to our capacity, we have definitely capacity that much more. And again, we have a multi-usage of our network that has been so-called the basis for this, meaning the same radio base stations are serving mobility, fixed wireless access and mobile edge compute, and we're not doing separate.

In the distant future, a way above the four and five, we can always come into sort of decisions of splitting cells in order to get more fixed wireless access, but that's very far away from now. We have ample capacity for the guide and much more than that. So and of course, our team is doing everything you'll see that we can continue to exceed our targets.

A - Matt Ellis{BIO 17999186 <GO>}
Hey, Tim, on the free-cash flow question. So absolutely one of our goals is to continue to grow cash-flow. Hans mentioned that, you should measure us on revenue growth, EBITDA growth and cash-flow growth, and that cash-flow growth is something we expect to be able to continue to generate going-forward, obviously the capital reduction from the high point in '22 to the guide we gave for this year and then an even lower amount next year will be a positive towards that as we continue to obviously, make progress on the income statement as well, you should see that contribute there as well. So that puts us in a position where we can start to see accelerated levels of debt reduction versus what you've seen in the past year or so. So, that's the targets we have ahead of us and look-forward to discussing progress again as we go-forward here.

Q - Tim Horan{BIO 1503813 <GO>}
Thank you.

A - Brady Connor{BIO 17932144 <GO>}

Operator
Thank you. The final question for today will come from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Q - Bryan Kraft{BIO 20667157 <GO>}
Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask you about business postpaid phone net-adds. It seems to be a bit lighter this quarter than they've been in the past four or five quarters, and I'm just wondering if you're seeing trends that softened due to macroeconomic factors, such as corporate staff reductions or if it's competitive reasons or is it any slowdown in the secular trend toward company issued devices?

And then related to that, can you talk about what you're assuming in the guidance at a high-level for the macroeconomic environment? For example are you assuming a soft landing scenario with small macro impact or are you baking in a more protracted downturn in the guidance? Thank you.

A - Hans Vestberg{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
Thank you. Yeah, so it's a multifaceted question on the fourth-quarter. Of course, on the business-to-business side, SMBs continue very strong and as I said, they need the store, a digital storefront and a mobile-first strategy in today's world of the COVID, so. I think that's where have been performing very well. On the, on the, on the enterprise side, it's a little bit different, but we see that 'Bring Your Own Device' is going down and we see more companies saying that they want the company phone which is of course helping us here, so and that we got -- that trend we have seen for a couple of quarters. So, I think both of them are pretty solid.

On the Consumer side, as I said, we we had positive net-adds. We had also, as I said before, a little bit spill-over from the churn from the price increase at the beginning of the quarter and then there were actually fewer days of sales in the fourth-quarter than in a normal quarter. So, I don't think there any new things more than what I said, customers were a little bit later in the holiday season to do that higher intent when the consumers--, but it was nothing macroeconomic different than I talked about, Matt and I talked about the bad debt and the delinquency being like a pre-COVID or equal or better than pre-COVID.

So now there is nothing there. We are of course watching it, but so-far, we continue to progress well.

A - Matt Ellis{BIO 17999186 <GO>}
Yep, just to add-on a couple of points, as you think about the VPG net-adds, you're always going to see a little bit of volatility up-and-down from one quarters to the next, just because of the size of some of the transactions there. So, all in all, the jobs numbers continue to be good, business numbers, good, obviously there has been some high-profile layoff announcements, but overall, job numbers are good, and you see that show-up in the overall, in the overall numbers that we produce throughout the year and look-forward to continuing to have best-in class market-share within the V, the Verizon Business Group space as we go-forward.

In terms of the macroeconomic assumptions in the guide, I wouldn't say we have anything too dissimilar to what you've heard from number other people during earnings season, but one of the things I'll come back to is, the resiliency of our customer-base. We've been through different types of economic environments in the past. We know customers pay their phone bills, before they pay other bills and other outgoings, we fully expect that to continue. And so, we're obviously watching the macroeconomic environment, but as Hans said, the payment patterns continue to be very strong and we'll stay close to that, but so far, so good.

Q - Bryan Kraft{BIO 20667157 <GO>}
Great, thank you.
