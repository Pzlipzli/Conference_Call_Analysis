Hello and welcome to Citi's Fixed Income Investor Review with Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason; and Treasurer, Mike Verdeschi. Today's call will be hosted by Tom Rogers, Head of Fixed Income, Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. We ask that you please limit questions to one question and one related follow-up. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.

Mr. Rogers, you may begin.

Thomas Rogers{BIO 19944600 <GO>}
Thank you, Natalia. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. As Natalia mentioned, I'm joined this morning by our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason; and our Treasurer, Mike Verdeschi. In a moment, Mike will take you through the Fixed Income investor presentation, which is available for download on our website citigroup.com, afterwards Mark and Mike will be happy to answer your question.

Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the cautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2019 Form 10-K.

Before I turn it over to Mike to walk through the presentation, I'd like to make a few comments about the frequency of the Fixed Income investor review going forward. First, I would say that we truly value the engagement of our Fixed Income investors, those during the Fixed Income investor review and outside of the review. And while we feel the investor review call is a great opportunity for our investors to engage with us in the public forum. At this point, we believe hosting the call two times a year is most appropriate.

So going forward, we would envision one call occurring after fourth quarter earnings and one call after second quarter earnings. However, we will of course host the call outside of the schedule, if there are updates that we believe our investors will benefit from. Again, with IV engagement and do not plan to be any [0:12:23.5] engage with our investors, as the nature and timing of that engagement will continue to evolve.

With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.

Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will cover a number of topics. First, I'll briefly discuss our 2020 operating results. Second, I will cover recent balance sheet trends. Third, I'll review our issuance program and finally, I'll discuss our continued strong liquidity and capital position.

Slide 3 summarizes our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. In 2020, we reported net income of $11.4 billion even as we increased our reserves by roughly $10 billion under the fiscal framework. On Slide 4, we show average balance sheet trends over the past five quarters in constant dollar. On this basis, we have grown our balance sheet by approximately 15% over the last year. As we continue to support our consumer and institutional clients, as they manage through the COVID-19 health crisis, while also maintaining a strong balance sheet.

In the fourth quarter, deposits grew in line with recent trends. With continued momentum in consumer and continued client engagement in our institutional business. Loans declined, reflecting lower levels of consumer and corporate activity. Trading related assets and liabilities grew, reflecting a continuation of heightened client activity relative to the prior year. And long-term debt increased year-over-year, but decreased sequentially as we maintain our robust liquidity profile and optimize our funding given our strong deposit growth.

Slide 5 presents strength in our loan portfolio on an average basis in constant dollar. Total Citigroup loans decreased 4% year-over-year. In our consumer franchise, average loans declined 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of lower consumer spending in our card business and higher payments by customers given high levels of liquidity due to fiscal stimulus.

In our institutional franchise, average loans decreased 3% year-over-year, breaking that down by business, average loans in Corporate Lending decreased 6% year-over-year, reflecting net repayments as we continue to assist our clients in accessing the capital markets. Private bank loans increased 6%, largely driven by secured lending to our high net worth clients including residential real estate lending. TTS loans decreased 10%, reflecting softness in underlying trade flows and the continued low level of spend in commercial card. And loans included in corp/other, continue to decline driven by the wind-down of legacy assets.

On Slide 6, we show credit quality trends in our GCB and ICG loan portfolio. In ICG, credit quality remained broadly stable. In the fourth quarter, non-accrual loans declined sequentially to $3.5 billion or 91 basis points of total loans, reflecting the write-offs and repayments across the portfolio. In GCB, credit trends remain broadly stable to improving this quarter, given high levels of liquidity in the US, lower spending and the benefit of relief programs.

While we do expect losses to begin to rise in 2021, given today's delinquency trends and the expected impact of recent stimulus, we now expect peak loss rates to be pushed out to the first half of 2022 with losses in Asia and Mexico peaking earlier than in the US. That said, with credit reserves of $27.8 billion, we believe we are well prepared for expected credit losses across both our consumer and institutional portfolio.

Turning to Slide 7, we showed trends in average deposits over the past five quarters income in dollar. Total average deposits increased 19% from the prior year period, reflecting continued client engagement as well as the elevated level of liquidity in their system.

Now let me cover our parent benchmark debt issuance program on Slide 8. In 2020, we issued approximately $20 billion of parent level benchmark debt across the variety of tenures, including the issuance of our inaugural $2.5 billion affordable housing bonds. So far in 2021, we issued roughly $2.5 billion. Going forward, we'll continue to maintain the flexibility to issue a mix of tenures, currencies and structures, as we prudently managing the liquidity profile of the firm and support our clients.

On Slide 9, let me cover our issuance maturity and redemption expectation. As I just mentioned in 2020, we issued approximately $20 billion of parent benchmark debt with $20 billion of maturity. Looking to 2021, we expect growth issuance of roughly $15 billion to $20 billion and we will maintain the flexibility to optimize our funding through opportunistic redemption.

On Slide 10, we show the composition of our long-term debt outstanding. During the fourth quarter, our total long-term debt declined by approximately $1 billion to $272 billion as we allowed our bank debt to mature, giving strong deposit growth.

On Slide 11, we provide an update of our LCR metric and drivers. Our average LCR was unchanged at 118% this quarter.

Turning to Slide 12, let me summarize our key regulatory capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 11.8% and our SLRs were 7% and 6.7% for Citigroup and Citi Bank respectively.

Moving to our last Slide, let me summarize several key points. In 2020, we demonstrated a significant earnings power and resilience of the franchise. We earned over $11 billion of net income, even as we increased credit reserve by roughly $10 billion. We maintain a strong capital position with a CET1 capital ratio of 11.8%, 180 basis points above our regulatory minimum requirement and SLR of 7% and the surplus above our TLAC requirement.

And we also maintain a strong liquidity position with an average LCR of 118% over $970 billion of available liquidity resources and we expect to be in compliance with the NSFR when the loan was effective. Our capital and liquidity profile remain strong and well positioned to withstand potential pressure, if economic conditions deteriorate. And we continue to have the flexibility to deploy these resources in ways that deepen and expand our client relationship and support the broader recovery.

Before we move on to Q&A. Let me touch briefly on LIBOR. As many of you on this call are aware, there have been some additional development since the third quarter Fixed Income Investor call. Subject to the results of the IBA consultation, it appears likely that most US dollar LIBOR tenures will continue to be published through June 2023.

At Citi, while we are continuing to work with our regulators in various industry working groups, including the alternative reference rate committee to ensure a smooth and timely transition. We do appreciate the flexibility to support. With regard to the subset of our performance, which we have mentioned on previous call, while we are continuing to evaluate alternatives, we don't have any further update at this time.

And with that, Mark and I will be happy to answer your question.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Hima Inguva with Bank of America.

Q - Hima Inguva{BIO 15845277 <GO>}
Great. Good morning and Happy New Year and again --

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
Good morning.

Q - Hima Inguva{BIO 15845277 <GO>}
Good morning and thank you for hosting the call. Mark, good morning, again. Mark, Mike and Tom, really appreciate the disclosures and the opportunity to have the dialog. And then sort of with SLR, when we are thinking about SLR and how moving from a backstop to being a binding measure? Would that impact the way you think about capital return and then in line with what your peers have commented on this? Maybe if you could give us some color and if you see retaining more equity or maybe issuing more debt or more PAT. And also if you could please suggest, if TLAC would be more binding than SLR in that case, so if you could kind of help us parse it out that would be great.

A - Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
Sure, Hima. Thanks for the question. Certainly an area of focus given SLR and TLAC exemption for reserves and treasury are set to expire at the end of 1Q. The short answer is that SLR would not become binding for us and so will not impact our capital return or even the press at this time. For SLR, the exemptions worth roughly 110 basis point though, all things equal. That 7% SLR will come down to 5.9%, so still 90 basis points above our regulatory minimum and we are assuming continued growth at a balance sheet driven by deposit but that 90 basis point of room gives us an opportunity to continue to grow.

In terms of TLAC, again with the exemption ending at 1Q, a binding constraint which flipped from RWA to leverage. And in leverage as of 4Q, we have a TLAC surplus of $32 billion. So that exemption is worth roughly $20 billion. So if it does expire that surplus comes down from $32 billion down to $12 billion, which is still above our 7 billion to 8 billion targeted range. So our issuance plans, do assume that exemption ends at 1Q and the issuance plans also consider the balance sheet growth that we expect to see in supporting our clients.

So the impact on TLAC, of course, it's something that we will be focused on. And hopefully, that gives you a sense of the implications. But taking a step back, just a few other thoughts. The Fed appropriately re-introduced Quantitative Easing measures as COVID unfolded early last year. And at that time, the KIWI actions were meant to add liquidity to address the market dislocation at that time.

The Fed of course has maintained KIWI, we have the markets have even stabilized and shifted that focus for using the accommodative stance and support employment and inflation goal. The byproduct of these half of the actions, is that liquidity in the system is grown and will remain elevated. So giving you some context, the fed grew its balance sheet by about $3.2 trillion in 2020, which drove industry deposit growth of about $2.8 trillion or little over 20%.

So that kind of deposit growth has implications on leverage and those key measures such as SLR and the GCIB score as well. So with monetary policy remaining accommodative, the exemption of reserves in treasury would still very much makes sense given where estimates of this liquidity is being deployed.

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
I'd add one point to that, which is I think one, we still -- we feel good about the ability to continue to return capital. So I would make that point. And then two, I think the Fed has been as you described Mike very thoughtful and constructive about providing this relief and I would hope that they give additional consideration around extending it or even making it permanent. And also taking a look at the GCIB score, given the amount of liquidity impact that score as well.

Q - Hima Inguva{BIO 15845277 <GO>}
Great. Appreciate it. I also want to recognize all the efforts that you're doing in terms of diversity and inclusion and its very good to see all that in the news, so appreciate that. With that I'm going to pass on.

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
Thank you, Hiima.

Your next question is from the line of Scott Keven with (inaudible).

Q - Unidentified Participant
Good morning, guys, thanks for the call. Before going to the questions, I just want to -- on your announcement about moving to two cost per year. I would say that we very much appreciate your industry leading outreach with Fixed Income investors, particularly these quarterly update and presentation. I would encourage the continuation or at least keeping up the overall high level of engagement. I think it pays benefit even with current spread levels being so tight.

Going on to questions, perhaps we can dive into the -- looking at the overall health of the consumer particularly in the credit card portfolio, could you give us your expectations for net charge-offs on both the retail and branded card portfolios for '21 and '22. And then could you dovetailed into what are you seeing as far as differentiation across the FICO bands between -- in these portfolios, really trying to get at is there is a differentiation between higher scores and lower scores and given our expected -- the written-off of the lot of the COVID release efforts and the pending eventual having to pay rent again for some people and then having to pay student loans. Again, is there kind of a risk or a uplift effect there in the impact on net charge-offs?

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you, Scott. Why don't I take that. First of all, I would say that we very much value the engagement with you all as investors as well. And so we look forward to continuing that. Secondly, with regard to the consuming of interest in the consumer, again has proven to be incredibly resilient through this and obviously the stimulus that's been provided has been helping to bridge consumers in a substantive way.

When we look at the performance that we've seen through the fourth quarter, we continue to see payment rates run out at a very, very good level. We saw a pickup in purchase sale activity, we're certainly not down nearly as much as it was earlier in the year and that's really across both portfolios, both the branded cards as well as the retail services portfolio. So not a lot of distinction between the two in terms of that positive activity.

As you would have seen in some of the cost of credit information, we've also seen delinquencies remain quite low in the portfolio and it's really the signs that we're seeing there of consumers' continued ability to pay and lower delinquencies that lead us to believe that we're more likely to see losses peak not no longer '21, but more likely in '22. Just speaking more broadly around the portfolio that's going to vary depending on region, but for the US portfolio that's been pushed out more likely to '22.

Now the reality is that, there is continued talk of an additional stimulus and to the extent that additional stimulus are put out there that is likely to have a continued impact. The good news with the additional stimulus, is some in similar behavior, is that payments continue the downside to that is that puts pressure on loan volumes. And so net-net, we think losses more likely in '22 at this point, additional stimulus could impact -- that impact additional stimulus could end up not only delaying peak losses, but also deflating peak losses. And so we're going to have to see how some of that plays out, but thus far, we feel very good about what we're seeing. And in fact, continue to look at these behaviors for signs, but where we should enter or re-enter the market so to speak with marketing and programs that lead towards acquisition.

Q - Unidentified Participant
That's very helpful.

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
(Multiple Speakers) for the customers.

Q - Unidentified Participant
That's very helpful. On the funding side, could you give us some guidance on what your expectations for a potential additional green or social bond issuance and then where you stand on the investments for the recent Affordable Housing bond issuance?

A - Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
Sure. So Scott, it's Mike. I think on that, when we -- we're very happy with the two green bond issuance that we've done, again starting in 2019 and then following up with the dollar base green bond in '20. Of course, we wanted to expand beyond that and so we introduced the affordable housing bond last year. And so we do very much want to remain active in this space of ESG. And so we'll look at other structures, we'll look at the potential to come back and tie the green bonds or another social as well.

So this is very much, it's something that will be a focus of ours. Of course, when we look at this issuance, we look at this issuance in the context of the broader need. Obviously we will be taking legal entities into account, tenure into account, investor demand. But it is something that we want to continue to stay active. And then, so with the housing bond, of course are the proceeds for the transaction finances, construction, rehabilitation or preservation of quality, affordable housing for low and moderate income populations in the US. So that's where the proceeds are used and of course, as I mentioned, we want to remain active in this space of issuance.

Your next question is from the line of Gary Dessler with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Gary Dessler
Hi, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. And I appreciate the call as always.

A - Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
Hi, Gary.

Q - Gary Dessler
Good morning. Just wanted -- I just wanted to touch on the press again. So you guys have not LIBOR, I think we though about ourselves a little bit of time there. But more on the some of the decision-making and it was helpful to get the conversation on the SLR. Thinking about that 2020 December CCAR and the redeem without replace option and looks like what you did issuance wise in December and what you're calling out? It looks like maybe it will go a little bit below 1.5% and sort of what's the target there in light of the CET1 cushion, as well as other constraints.

And when you think about the refinancing decisions, when you look at the two powerful pieces of paper that you have left on the institutional side, those are both economically could be refinanced and so should we be thinking about -- purely about the reset and when you think about replacing potentially refi and different structures. Do you think more, when you think about they are non-call 5 versus a non-call 10. Do you care more about coupon optionality? The back-end, like how should we be thinking about these things?

A - Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
Sure. Thanks for the question. Even in past, we've talked about a target of roughly 150 basis point. And where we end the quarter, we're probably more like 160. So that range that target of 150 is still something that we do think about. And as you pointed out, obviously, we issued late last year and use that as an opportunity to cost structures that was an economic decision. And as we look at our structures, as we've talked about in the past, as they become callable. We'll continue to first look at the need for maintaining that capital outstanding. And if so, we'll look at the economics associated with leaving that structure outstanding versus calling it and replacing it with the new structure.

In terms of the structure itself, as you said, the tenure of that call or even the back-end setting that we embed, it's really going to be a function of where that investor demand. So we want to keep a good dialog and understand, where that may be preferences. Of course, you've seen so far in the past as part of that transition away from LIBOR, but more recently CMT and again, that's a function of where perhaps some of the preferences are obviously with rates very low and some stick with that yield curve that five-year CMT seem to make sense. So you're likely to see us continue with that same practice of that targeted range of 150, the evaluation of the economics as well as other factors. And then in terms of structure where going to continue to maintain that good dialog with the investors on what may be preferable.

Q - Gary Dessler
Great, that's helpful. Thank you.

A - Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
Sure.

Your next question is from the line of Brian Marti-Lyon with Barclays.

Q - Brian Marti-Lyon
Hey, good morning guys.

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
Good morning.

A - Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
Hi, Brian.

Q - Brian Marti-Lyon
So there is a positive development in New York that moving forward with a LIBOR solution via the legislative route. I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about specifically in New York, if that becomes law fixing that going to fall back language. Where specifically that helps and then maybe what other parts of your capital structure might need something in Delaware, something similar in Delaware, like I think some of the preferred are covered by Delaware law.

A - Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
Sure. Brian, it's Mike. Yes, in terms of that legislation, I think I've said this in the past. The LIBOR transition, it's certainly a complex transition and the recognition of coming up with some legislative solution, we think is a very positive development. And you talked about New York and the press would be more applicable to Delaware. But I would say, just getting started on a framework for legislation, in terms of what -- how that would apply? What is the scope of it? I think it is a positive development. Is generally, could you see states following one carries a precedent in a framework. The other thing I would point out too is, is there more -- is there a development in the federal space as well around legislation?

So I think this is the types of developments that are encouraging and New York on its own may not solve some of the things that we're focused on, on its own. We still think it's a positive development as well as that potential for legislation is up, the federal legislation as well.

Q - Brian Marti-Lyon
Thanks. Maybe a question for Mark. Any thought you can give us around the timing of the review that you're data going through around of the different businesses and how you think about investment, et cetera, going forward?

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
Sure. Brian, you came across a little bit muscle. But I think you were asking about the timing in terms of the strategy from May and June, is that right?

Q - Brian Marti-Lyon
Correct, correct. Yes.

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
Yes. So look, I mean, you obviously heard Jane on the earnings call, she takes seat end of February, 1 of March. And so certainly want to give her time to get squarely in the CEO seat. And as you mentioned, we're spending time now and we'll spend kind of some period of time thereafter to try and really try and do a thorough review. What I would say though is that, in some ways you can look at some of the announcements that we put out already. And see that we're not waiting when things make sense, right? So we recently announced the creation of a new wealth management unit, which really brings together our private bank in our consumer wealth organization, which includes the international personal bank and the Citi personal wealth management business and brings all of that together and really moves to create a single integrated platform to serve our clients, clients everywhere from the affluent level straight up to the ultra high net worth clients.

And I simply highlight that to say that, while we are working on taking a look at the strategy has changed suggested. We're not waiting where things make sense to kind of get off the ground. And so stay tuned, we'll continue to work through it and it obviously an imperative for the entire leadership team with team driving.

Your next question is from the line of Arnold Kakuda with Bloomberg Intelligence.

Q - Arnold Kakuda{BIO 18010073 <GO>}
Hey. Mark, Mike and Tom, appreciate the call, so is very helpful. So compared to peers, your 11.5% CET1 target is very conservative. That 150 basis point above your 10% requirement and that compares with peers that are may be looking at 50 to 150 basis point excess target. So you've done well on the past few stress test, you've talked about this evaluation process. I think simplification was a word I heard, so is there a chance to evaluate the CET1 target well going forward?

A - Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
So what I'd say is, look we are still, as you know, we're still kind of managing through a crisis with some uncertainty that's still out there. And so as I sit here today, I continue to feel good about the 11.5% when we established that, as you know, we were looking and still had uncertainty around things like the stress capital buffer and how that would play out. We've now seen that both it for 2.5% from the initial submission and an increase of about 10 basis points in the most recent, although that's not being applied.

There is still movement obviously with the GCIB score that I referenced earlier, which is at 3% for us now, but with the increase in deposits, we're currently running a bit higher than that. And so I feel good about the 11.5% and we'll continue to look at that as things continue to normalize. But at this stage, that's where we are. Now I would remind you or continue to point out that we ended the fourth quarter at 11.8%, which obviously is above that target that we have and I think we've had a pretty good run rate leading into this prices of being thoughtful about returning capital at a reasonable pace. And we'll continue to do that particularly given that the Fed has reinstated the ability to do that in Q1 here and so we're looking forward to that.

Q - Arnold Kakuda{BIO 18010073 <GO>}
Great, thanks for that. And then shifting to deposit. The classics key chains, I guess part of that deposits are good. But in this low rate world where there is lots of liquidity and low loan demand. Have deposits become a burden in a sense or is there something? Is it just the phase of the cycle where demand is low for loans? You want to take on that extra -- I guess relationship, so our deposits a burden right now?

A - Unidentified Speaker
Yes, I mean I can start and then Mike, you may want to want to chime in. What I'd say, we obviously talk to some of the deposit momentum of growth that we've seen across the franchise. And I think probably a couple of lenses through which one can look at that, one is it obviously is, a lower cost of funding than some of the other alternatives that everyone would have. But two is, I think, if you look at the nature of the growth that we've had, take for example, the US consumer, it really leverages or demonstrate the pay-off, if you will from the investments we've been making in our digital capability and helps to expand our customer footprint beyond just where we have branches and so that's good.

And as you know, we look to use that to expand our wallet share with those customers. And the third thing I'd point to is, even as we look on the institutional side, where we've had good deposit growth with our TTS client, it really is and does create a for ready to expand the nature of those relationships as well as they opened new digital accounts with us and expanded the dialog to include conversation around their supply chain and things of that sort out. The reality is, what there is also -- the other factor that comes into play here is, what you suggested, which is that there is low loan demand and that is something that we continue to watch and monitor and the deposits do put pressure on the GCIB Score and we just talk a little bit about the SLR as well.

And so we'll have to continue to manage that and monitor that and hopefully we end up with relief as it relates to things like GCIB. But we are pushing us from a relationship point of view. And then we think that's pretty important. Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?

A - Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
No, nothing to add, Mark.

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}

Your next question is from the line of Robert Motley with UBS.

Q - Robert Motley{BIO 19405326 <GO>}
Hi, thanks a lot and a lot of -- good morning, Mark, Mike and Tom. Lot of questions asked and answered. So a couple of follow-up, on Scott's question on consumers. Given that you're seeing in the US, probably credit peaking in the first half of next year. Will the allowance for loan loss reserves there just remain static for the rest of the year or could you see reserving of releasing some of those reserves, as you get a better handle on, on that and maybe there is some seasonal implications in there that you could talk about?

Second question I had was on Slide 22. And it relates to your comments on Rest of the World, Latin American 90 days that pass-through picking up to 2.5%. Is that what you're seeing and that's why you're seeing that peak there will be in the second half of this year and then I had a question on the IB.

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
Sure. Why don't I start with your question with regard to consumer reserves and what could impact that going forward. I guess, there are a couple of things that factor into the reserving actions that we take. And so one would certainly be changes in the portfolio and that is to say recovery in spend and increase in loan volumes or even customer behavior and mix. Those things will factor, what happens with the -- factor into what happens with the reserve levels. The second is kind of the base scenario or even the two scenarios that we look at, right? So the base scenario, which will reflect the shape and the pace of recovery. I mean, to the extent that we continue to see improvement in that base scenario, the key assumptions GDP, unemployment, et cetera, that will have an impact on our estimate for the lifetime reserves in this case associated with the consumer portfolio.

The third would be how we look at the downside scenario and obviously to the extent that it's more severe or a higher probability, although downside or lower probability of a downside that will factor in, how we think about that EUMA that management adjustment that we've talked about before. And then losses obviously play-in as well, as we see those losses materialize, all things being equal, we'd be releasing reserves. So there are number of factors that will come into play as we see reserves move around in the coming quarters.

What I would say or the final point I'd make on this is that, even as we sit here now relative to the assumptions we had for many of those variables, when we ended the year, many of them have moved-in, in a positive direction have improved. And so not to repeat it all again, but that becomes a factor that shape and shape and pace of the recovery is factored in there. And as I said on the earnings call, I do expect that we will see improved profitability in 2021 and we're more likely to see TC releases.

In terms of -- and your second question was with regard to Latin America and what I'd say here is and I'm looking at kind of the trend that we saw in both NCL as well as delinquencies. And in the earnings deck we showed that delinquencies were coming down in the fourth quarter. And that -- I'm sorry that losses were coming down in the fourth quarter, excuse me and that delinquencies were picking up a bit. And what I'd highlight there is the difference between customers that are on the relief program and coming off versus customers that were never on that relief program.

And so what we're seeing in the delinquencies that are on that chart, reflects the fact that customers coming off the relief program are starting to flow through. Those delinquency bucket, what we're seeing in the lower net credit losses or represents favorable performance from customers that we're not on the relief program. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of dynamic. But to answer your question more specifically, it is that trend in delinquencies that give us a view that we are likely to see losses for Latin America in this example, peak in the first half of 2021.

Your next question is from the line of Nikhil Kohli with JPMorgan.

Q - Nikhil Kohli{BIO 18968695 <GO>}
Good morning and thank you for hosting the call. Two things, I want to follow up on Brian's question on the preferred side. Given that there is a legislative solution out there and to your point, if it extends to Delaware and is a federal angle to it. If that would happen, would it preclude the exchange often sent paths that you've been talking about on previous calls? So if there is a legislative solution would it not go down the exchange and concerned, because you can essentially -- you have a fallback language to a legislative path?

A - Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
We would have to see of course with that solution would entail. It's a good question, because I think when you think about the complexity of the transition. When you have things like preferred -- you would put that in the category of probably structures, certainly that remain fixed or even ones that are flow that would essentially convert this text. Those are the types of things that are complicated.

And so I do think legislation is one of those areas that could provide a solution, but I do think it's going to be in consideration for what's included in that legislation. We've talked about an amendment, we've talked about an exchange. We will continue to evaluate the various alternatives to make sure we're ready to deal with any of those options when the timing is right.

Q - Nikhil Kohli{BIO 18968695 <GO>}
Great, thank you for that. And a follow-up to the peak losses. If your guidance around peak losses in the US and now in the first half of next year. How should we think about delinquencies spending there and when should delinquencies very similar to what we're seeing in Latin America now where people coming out relief programs, are flowing into be higher delinquency buckets. When will that happen in the US, given the TDR relief, I believe has been extended until the end of 2021.

So just trying to kind of triangulate, are you using that TDR relief for people coming off (inaudible), now flowing into delinquency buckets or when should we see that happen in the US?

A - Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
Yes, sure. So I guess I'd make a couple of points. One, I'd like to correct, I think I -- may have said that, peak losses in Mexico would be in the second half. I meant that they would peak in the first half of 2021. So I just wanted to correct myself on that. In terms of US peak losses, again there are a number of factors that coming to play there, including kind of how the stimulus continues to evolve and how much more stimulus introduced. And so while that is the current timing and a view that stimulus response, as well as the behavior from consumers will be a major factor as to what peak levels look like and the timing of them.

So I mentioned earlier, the idea of delaying or deflating. In terms of TDRs, which I think was the other part of your question. We really don't expect to see a material impact. We had limited usage of this relief kind of outside of the programs and to some extent even within the programs that the usage has been limited. So again, I would say that any relief really didn't have a significant impact and many of the important factors and variables and I don't think that, that will have a material impact on a playing into losses in the -- in 2021.

Your next question is from the line of Mark Teo with (inaudible).

Q - Unidentified Participant
Hi, good morning. Just two quick questions. It sounds like there were some newer tech perception firms, are looking towards their banks for more additional lending to provide a (inaudible) equity financing before the IPO or two years back. Can you just kind of talk about how you manage the credit risk of lending to those firms, particularly as they need to be on the IPO docket. Thank you.

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
I'm sorry, would you -- I don't quite time hearing your question, would you mind repeating them?

Q - Unidentified Participant
Yes, sure. Sorry. It sounds like some of the New York tech firms are looking towards our banks for additional lending to avoid a final round of equity funding before IPOing or going to us back structure. I'm just wondering how you are managing the credit risk of potentially lending to those firms and the debt capacity and but also needs to be on the IPO mandates?

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
Sure. Yes. So I mean again and I think you noticed about our kind of risk framework and how we think about our credit profile. I mean, we tend to focus predominantly on our large multinational clients that predominantly investment grade. We stick to kind of sectors that on our clients that are strongest in their sectors and that we have long-standing relationships with.

That said, we have been very active from an investment banking point of view in the SPAC space and certainly have seen that play out in our equity capital markets performance through the year. As it relates to credit risk related to that, we obviously have a robust framework and infrastructure around that and we set credit limits across different risk parameters for clients. And this would not be any exception to that in terms of -- not only monitoring the profile of those clients to making sure that we're operating inside of limits that makes sense for the type of exposure that we want to take off.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Okay, thank you. And just my second question, it sounds like you're kind of waiting for a lot of external factors around the two step for the SLR. But is there any further optimization both on the assets and the liabilities, how your balance sheet that you plan to do just given the elevated deposit trend that like to exist for the near future?

A - Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
Sorry, Mark. Are you asking what are things can we do on balance sheet sort of -- and the deployment of those deposits?

Q - Unidentified Participant
Yeah, even up -- kind of around the asset side as well.

A - Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
Sure. As we look at the balance sheet and we think about that deposit growth. Last year, obviously, you did see a surge in that lending activity that we're client draws. But given the amount of liquidity in the system, we saw those loans repaid as we were supporting clients to access the market at that time. Yes, when we think about this year that liquidity in the system remains to that still very much dynamic. And when you think about what we could do on balance sheet, maybe just starting on the liability side. That deposit growth does give us an opportunity to reduce some of the wholesale funding that we would have had and what I mean by that in particular things like FHLB. So we can reduce that short term, long-term that makes room for us to taking those deposit to support our clients.

Of course, we'll always be looking at the callable structures as well and whether we do need that liquidity or whether we should call it. So there's always going to be a set of liability optimization that will be thinking about. On the asset side, of course, you mentioned lending in the minutes like, even in the investment portfolio over the past year. We grew that investment portfolio close to 80 billion and the vast majority of that went into US treasuries, but we also invested in non-dollar coverage in agency MBS as well. So that will be something that we continue to evaluate then and deploy investments to certainly as we've seen some steepening of the yield curve in 10 years, rates popping above 1% that we are looking at. And of course fed yield curve continues to steepen which we think it could -- that will continue to provide an opportunity there.

And then of course, we'll be evaluating how lending activity evolved over the course of the year. But that would be of course the more traditional deployment of those deposit. But the combination of looking at managing the liability side, as well as deployment into security, those are all things that we will be looking at to optimize.

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
I mean, I think that's right, Mike and we're going to actively manage all of this. I mean, we can't forget that, the increased liquidity that we've seen on the heels of some of the Fed monetary actions or a byproduct of this COVID-19 pandemic prices that we're managing through. And that we're not entirely through yet. And so we're going to continue to look at the balance sheet both liabilities, as well as assets and try to manage that actively with our client focus in mind and certainly, keeping in mind the capital implications, but we really need to kind of do is, ensure that we get through all of this and get back to some level of normalcy as it relates to all of these things.

Your next question is from the line of Kevin Maloney with BlackRock.

Q - Kevin Maloney{BIO 17242242 <GO>}
Thanks guys. As loss cookies can push out and cards to '22 and spend is recurring or how are you thinking about the card portfolio, increasing marketing spend maybe to get transactors or are you changing any credit adjustments or you just trying to stay cautious?

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
Yes, look, it's the right question and when I think back to the last prices, we learned that timing is critically important. The timing for which you put mitigating risk management in place, as well as the timing which you decide to re-enter the market. We've taken several actions while continuing to serve clients including pausing certain marketing programs and balanced consolidation offers, pausing proactive credit limit increases and reducing the size of introductory line. We've tightened the parameters around some of the digital lending activity that we've done, we've tightened parameters around some of our customers.

And so we've done a whole host of being in order to ensure that we've been managing the risk through this environment. Those actions obviously have an impact on interest bearing balance growth and therefore on revenues. So it's going to be important for us to re-enter the market with client offers given or when the environment kind of supports that. And to that end, we have been testing target market reentry that's included sequential increases in advertising quarter-over-quarter and marketing spend in the fourth quarter.

In Asia, in markets where the pandemic is more controlled, we've initiated some of the unwind of some of our credit tightening action. And we're looking to ensure that we can take advantage of the turn in customer interest and when that starts to play out. In the US and Mexico expansion frankly has been a little bit more limited to date and over time we will again look for the right timing to leg in more meaningfully.

Q - Kevin Maloney{BIO 17242242 <GO>}
Great, answer. Thank you. Lastly, there are FinTech non-base financials and there is any consumer lending space, including I guess, buy now, pay later, guys. Is that a competitive threat to the card market or is it too small to even think about?

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
I'm sorry. I just couldn't make out the connection here --

Q - Kevin Maloney{BIO 17242242 <GO>}
There is been a number of non-bank and fin-tech financials entered the consumer lending space, including buy now, pay later concepts. Is that competitive threat to the card market or is it just too small to think about at this point?

A - Mark Mason{BIO 16365577 <GO>}
Look we don't take any of kind of the new fin-tech strategies for granted. But what I would say is that, those are small efforts. We do have I think a meaningful scale in our cards business. And we've got I think a very good risk framework or how we want -- how we assess new and existing customers and manage our exposure in a fashion that allows for us to get returns that make good sense.

And so on top of that, our strategy involves how we expand the offering that we have with these clients and how we serve them with enhanced digital capabilities. And I think the combination of continuing to evolve our solutions, new channels for accessing clients like our Google relationship, as well as enhanced servicing play to ensure that we kind of continue to capture growth when the market kind of stabilizes and we'll watch many of those other players entering the market or in the meantime, we are staying engaged with our customer base here.

Your final question is from the line of Ryan Patrick with Lord Abbett.

Q - Ryan Patrick{BIO 7448214 <GO>}
Hi, thanks for hosting the call again. Just a follow on from Mark's earlier question. On Slide 11, as it relates to the high quality liquid assets. So year-over-year, this is up 24%, available cash is at 56% versus 37% a year ago. And you have things like level two assets at 7% versus 14% a year ago now. So I was wondering maybe if you could talk a little bit more about the pace and the categories that you could potentially consider redeploying some of the available cash. Obviously, there is no element of conservatism here just given the background that you're operating in. But I think it's just an interesting market dynamic to consider.

A - Michael Verdeschi{BIO 6530762 <GO>}
Yes, it's Mike. I do think you raised a good point. So we do have ample space in that level too. If I talk about over the past year, we really did deploy to be -- I'll say the vast majority of that portfolio that we hold, which is going to be highly liquid products. Over time, we do typically look at spread product as well, we have deployed the spread products in the past. Given the amount of surplus liquidity in the system today, spreads have come in.

So we do want to look at all the asset classes and evaluate the opportunity, but we are -- if we're going to deploy to less liquid, we are going to look at the returns on capital as well. So we want to be focused on the economics too. So that didn't mean to rule out that we would look at those categories. But again, it's a portfolio that we're going to maintain good liquidity and until the vast majority would continue to be into those more liquid products such as treasuries, agency mortgages. But at the right time, we will look to continue to expand spread products, if those opportunities arise.
